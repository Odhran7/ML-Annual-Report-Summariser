environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive criteria emissions control our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain nonghg automotive emissions including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world often with very little harmonization regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers for additional information refer to item 1a risk factors 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the us federal government through the environmental protection agency epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us the california air resources board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt california emission standards in lieu of federal requirements seventeen states and the district of columbia have adopted california emission standards and there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california emission requirements in the future 

for each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavyduty engines will meet emission requirements of the epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and of carb before we can sell vehicles in california and the states that have adopted california emission requirements 

the canadian federal governments current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with us federal requirements 

in 2019 certain areas within china began implementation of the china 6 emission standard china 6 requirements china 6 combines elements of both european union eu and us standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance nationwide implementation of china 6a for new registrations occurred in january 2021 and the more stringent china 6b is expected to be implemented in july 2023 

brazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as l7 to be implemented in 2022 and l8 to be implemented from 2025 onward l7 standards cover tailpipe exhaust gases durability for emissions evaporative emissions and noise limits and include additional obd requirements and a phasein for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems l8 standards include targets for vehicle emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031 some of the requirements are aligned with those of the epa 

as a result of the sale of the opel and vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in europe opelvauxhall business gm’s vehicle presence in europe is smaller but gm may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to opelvauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the opelvauxhall business as well as to other vehicles gm continues to sell in europe in the eu increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standards may result in changes to these standards as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement for example our former german subsidiary has participated in continuing discussions with german and european authorities concerning emissions control systems beyond this as a part of the eu’s desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility the eu is looking to develop stricter emission standards euro 7 for all petrol and diesel cars vans lorries and buses as well as reform co2 standards and place requirements on batteries to be used in evs for additional information refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

automotive fuel economy and ghg emissions in the us nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for three separate fleets domestic cars import cars and lightduty trucks manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after considering all available credits for the preceding five model years expected credits for the three succeeding model years and credits obtained from other manufacturers in addition to federal cafe standards the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standards in march 2020 nhtsa and the epa issued a rule setting fuel economy and ghg emission standards for lightduty vehicles through the 2026 model year those actions are currently being challenged through litigation however the litigation is currently held in abeyance as the agencies have since proposed new more stringent lightduty cafe and ghg standards though nhtsa and the epa have previously issued joint cafe and ghg standards the agencies have now separately proposed and the epa has finalized standards with differing stringency levels and affected model years with the proposed cafe standards addressing the 20242026 model years and the ghg standards addressing the 20232026 model years nhtsa and the epa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emissions of medium and heavyduty vehicles imposing more stringent standards over time 

in addition carb has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards for motor vehicles and other states have asserted the right to adopt carbs standards carb regulations previously stated that compliance with the lightduty epa ghg program is deemed compliance with carb standards however in december 2018 carb amended this regulation to state that in the event the epa were to alter federal ghg stringency which it now has compliance with the epas ghg emission standards will no longer be deemed compliance with carbs separate requirements in september 2019 nhtsa issued a rule asserting that california is preempted from regulating ghg emissions litigation challenging that rule is currently being held in abeyance as the epa has since proposed and nhtsa has finalized actions that could result in a restoration of california’s ability to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards depending on the outcome of the 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

federal cafe and ghg rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of carbs regulatory amendment in the future gm might be required to meet differing epa ghg california ghg and cafe standards 

carb has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of zero emission vehicles zevs must be sold in california the clean air act permits states to adopt california emission standards and 14 have adopted the zev requirements in september 2019 the epa revoked the waiver it had granted to california that permitted its zev program and nhtsa also asserted preemption of californias zev program litigation over epa and nhtsas actions is currently being held in abeyance as epa and nhtsa have since proposed actions that could result in a restoration of california’s ability to promulgate and enforce zev standards depending on any final agency action taken by the epa and nhtsa andor the outcome of the related litigation there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california zev requirements in the future 

in canada light and heavyduty ghg regulations are currently patterned after the epa ghg emission standards given the integrated nature of the auto sector between canada and the united states the canadian government is conducting a midterm review of its 2022 to 2025 model year lightduty ghg standards and is considering regulatory developments of the us in this regard in addition the canadian province of quebec has zev requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on california program requirements and the province of british columbia’s similar zev regulations that were completed in july 2020 and cover the 2020 to 2039 model years both provinces are further updating their zev regulations and the canadian federal government recently proposed to ban the sale of ice vehicles in canada beginning in 2035 although no specific draft regulations have been shared at this time 

china has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement with a focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement the china phase 5 launched in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025 in addition china has established a mandate that requires passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles which are referred to as new energy vehicles nevs to generate credits in 2019 and beyond the number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency with the goal of increasing nev volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over time uncommitted nev credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement china has issued nev credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new nev credit targets aimed at further increasing volumes of nevs in 2024 and 2025 china has provided various levels of subsidies for nevs and certain subsidies have been extended to the end of 2022 

in brazil the secretary of industry and development promulgates and enforces cafe standards and has enforced a new cafe program for the period october 2020 to september 2026 and october 2026 to september 2032 for lightduty and midsize trucks and suvs including diesel vehicles imposing more stringent standards for each period 

we have several options to comply with existing and potential new global regulations such options include increasing production and sale of certain vehicles such as evs and curtailing production of less fuel efficient ice vehicles technology changes including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades payment of penalties andor purchase of credits from third parties we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulations 

we plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations supported by a commitment to sciencebased targets in addition the company announced our vision of an allelectric future and our plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new lightduty vehicles by 2035 these targets align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an allelectric future which will be enabled by our ultium platform and hydrotec technology as previously detailed we also announced in june 2021 our plans to increase our investment in evs and avs to more than 350 billion through 2025 to accelerate this transformation plan 

industrial environmental control our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment including climate change we are embracing sustainability programs focused on reducing operational ghg emissions water consumption and discharge and waste disposal 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in 2021 we launched our new global gm zero waste program with a goal to divert waste from landfills and incinerators for the year ended december 31 2021 gms facilities included in the global gm zero waste program diverted over 11 million metric tons of waste from landfills and incinerators through composting reusing and recycling 

in addition to reducing our impact on the environment our waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of raw materials and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables to that end we have set a goal of meeting the electricity needs of our operations with 100 renewable energy by 2025 in the us a goal we recently accelerated from 2030 and by 2035 globally 

through december 31 2021 we implemented projects and signed renewable energy contracts globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by 2023 which represents approximately 75 of our us electricity use and approximately 40 of our global electricity use in 2019 and 2020 we executed two of our largest green tariffs to date with dte energy company sourcing 840000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that began supplying us in early 2021 in phase 1 with the remainder expected in mid2023 in phase 2 additionally in 2020 we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date with 180 megawatts of solar electricity supplying our us operations starting in 2023 we continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas including executing a 28 megawatts solar green tariff with tva to supply our bowling green assembly plant in 2021 energy star certified two assembly plants and four buildings in the us for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at five additional sites by reducing energy intensity an average of 15 at these sites within two years to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 within a five year period in total 69 gmowned manufacturing sites have met the epa challenge with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 132 recognitions additionally we received recognition from the us department of energy doe of 50001 ready status for 25 facilities the us doe 50001 ready program is a selfguided approach for facilities to establish an energy management system and selfattest to the structure of iso 50001 a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial commercial and institutional facilities these sustainability efforts reduce our operational expenses and are part of our approach to improve the sustainability of our operations by aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goals and reduction targets collecting accurate data and publicly reporting progress against our targets 

chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

globally governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaties and initiatives such as the stockholm basel and rotterdam conventions on chemicals and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the restriction on hazardous substances and waste from electrical and electronic equipment directives new european requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the european market to disclose substances of concern in parts 

chemical regulations are increasing in north america in the us the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act in addition several us states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and use requirements chemical restrictions and export controls in canada continue to steadily progress under the environment and climate change canadas chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic 

these emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity manufacturers including joint venture partners and suppliers that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties production disruptions or limitations on the sale of affected products we believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates

vehicle safety 

us requirements the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 the safety act regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell the safety act prohibits the sale in the united states of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and nongovernmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex and lack harmonization globally the safety act further requires that if we or nhtsa determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles should we or nhtsa determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial 

other national requirements outside of the us many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional more stringent requirements in the future the european general safety regulation has introduced united nations economic commission for europe unece regulations which are required for the european type approval process globally governments generally have been adopting unece based regulations with some variations to address local concerns any difference between north american and unece based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity new safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world including in china brazil and gulf cooperation council countries also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally in canada vehicle regulatory requirements are currently aligned with us regulations however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act recall thresholds are different and the minister of transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or noncompliance when the minister considers it to be in the interest of safety further various governments are beginning to mandate ecall and other features that can be marketspecific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally 

crash test ratings and new car assessment programs organizations in various regions around the world including in the us rate and compare motor vehicles through various new car assessment programs ncaps to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles ncaps use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations and use stars to rate vehicle safety with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest achieving high ncap ratings which can vary by country and region can add complexity and cost to vehicles

 item 1a risk factors 

we have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us these risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence 

risks related to our competition and strategy 

if we do not deliver new products services technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry our business could suffer we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years particularly as traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of evs in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of startups and other nontraditional competitors in the automotive industry these new competitors as well as established industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies products services directtoconsumer sales channels methods of transportation and vehicle ownership to successfully execute our longterm strategy we must continue to develop new products and services including products and services that are outside of our historically core ice business such as evs and avs softwareenabled connected services and other new businesses 

our vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex the process of designing and developing new technology products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained if costs of capital increased significantly or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers in each case including as a result of any constraints on lending due to concerns about climate change our ability to execute on our strategic plans could be adversely affected further the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans 

there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way if at all that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage further if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware or fail to deploy updates to our software properly or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models including evs that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models including evs that preserve our reputation for designing building and selling safe highquality cars trucks and suvs is critical to our longterm profitability successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability the new vehicle development process can take two years or more and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions regulatory developments transportation infrastructure and changes in quality safety reliability and styling demands and preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our longterm strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of evs the production and profitable sale of evs has become increasingly important to our longterm business as we accelerate our transition to an allelectric future in 2021 we increased our commitment to investments in ev and av technologies to more than 350 billion from 2020 through 2025 with plans to launch more than 30 new ev models globally across several price points in that timeframe our ev strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of highquality evs that are competitive and meet consumer demands reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of evs particularly with respect to batteries increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers develop new software and services and leverage our scale manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ice vehicles 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in addition consumer adoption of evs will be critical to the success of our strategy consumer adoption of evs could be impacted by numerous factors including the breadth of the portfolio of evs available perceptions about ev features quality safety performance and cost relative to ice vehicles the range over which evs may be driven on a full battery charge the proliferation of charging infrastructure in particular with respect to public ev charging stations cost and availability of high fueleconomy ice vehicles volatility or a sustained decrease in the cost of petroleumbased fuel failure by governments and other third parties to make the investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and ev charging stations and to provide economic incentives promoting the adoption of evs and negative feedback from stakeholders impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry if we are unable to successfully deliver on our ev strategy it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects and could negatively impact our brand and reputation 

our nearterm profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of fullsize ice suvs and fullsize ice pickup trucks while we offer a broad portfolio of cars crossovers suvs and trucks and we have announced significant plans to design build and sell a broad portfolio of evs we currently recognize higher profit margins on our fullsize ice suvs and fullsize ice trucks our nearterm success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes we also plan to use the cash generated by our ice vehicles to fund our growth strategy including the development and sale of evs and avs any nearterm shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuelefficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability concerns about climate change including any constraints related to lending on ghgemitting products or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles more stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs associated with these vehicles see “our operations and products are subject to extensive laws regulations and policies including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business” 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality innovation new technologies pricing fuel economy reliability safety customer service and financial services offered additionally overall manufacturing capacity in the industry has historically far exceeded demand in addition we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in ev manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for ev demand which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described above many manufacturers including gm have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs often as a result of collective bargaining agreements in light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices as a result we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations which could affect our profitability our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness 

manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a lowcost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results in these markets 

our av strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks gm cruise holdings llc cruise holdings our majorityowned subsidiary is responsible for the development and commercialization of av technology our av operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including our ability to continue to develop selfdriving software and hardware such as light detection and ranging lidar sensors and other components access to sufficient capital risks related to the manufacture of purposebuilt avs and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to av technologies than we do in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of avs on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur we could be subject to liability reputational harm government scrutiny and further regulation and it could deter consumer adoption of av technology any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we are subject to risks associated with climate change including increased regulation of ghg emissions changing consumer preferences and other risks related to our transition to evs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change and changes in consumer preferences may result in increased costs reduced demand for our products reduced profits risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense which may be material these requirements may increase the cost of andor diminish demand for our ice vehicles see “our operations and products are subject to extensive laws regulations and policies including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business” 

part of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to evs which presents additional risks including reduced demand for and therefore profits from our ice vehicles which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy higher costs related to ev technologies impacting profitability compared to ice vehicles and risks related to the success of our ev strategy see “our longterm strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of evs” and “our nearterm profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of fullsize ice suvs and fullsize ice pickup trucks” 

finally increased intensity frequency or duration of storms droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production logistics cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our operations 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain the availability and prices of used vehicles levels of unemployment and inflation availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence and demand for vehicles political unrest or uncertainty the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness including covid19 barriers to trade and other global economic conditions for a discussion of economic and market trends see the overview section in part ii item 7 mda any significant decrease in new vehicle sales could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

high prices and uncertain availability of commodities raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers or instability in logistics and related costs could negatively impact our profitability increases in prices for commodities raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products systems components and parts such as steel precious metals nonferrous metals critical minerals or other similar raw materials or increases in logistics and related costs may lead to higher production costs for parts components and vehicles in addition any increase in the cost of critical materials for our ev propulsion systems including lithium nickel cobalt and certain rare earth metals could lead to higher production costs for our evs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our ev strategy further increasing global demand for and uncertain supply of such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner andor could lead to increased costs geopolitical risk fluctuations in supply and demand any weakening of the us dollar and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities raw materials and other inputs these inflationary pressures could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs 

our business in china subjects us to unique operational competitive and regulatory risks pursuing opportunities in the chinese market is an important component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as nontraditional market participants such as domestic technology companies in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to evs infotainment softwareenabled connected services and other new technologies our ability to fully deploy our technologies in china may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the us and china increased competition continued uschina trade tensions or weakening economic conditions in china among other factors may result in cost increases price reductions reduced sales profitability and margins and challenges to gaining or holding market share 

certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market at times with challenging lead times these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china or 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

limit how and under what conditions we may do business in china which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationships and a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures which we cannot operate solely for our benefit we are engaged in many strategic business relationships and we expect that such arrangements will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business particularly in light of industry consolidation however there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationships in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do or that any strategic business relationships that we enter into will be successful if we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business relationships in the future our overall growth could be impaired and our business prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in addition many of our operations primarily in china and korea as well as our battery manufacturing operations with lg energy solution are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners interests in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected further the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive actions or we may be subject to penalties fines or other punitive actions for these activities 

the international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and a variety of other political economic and regulatory risks including 1 changes in government leadership 2 changes in trade compliance labor employment tax privacy environmental and other laws regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives 3 political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials services components systems and parts or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives 4 political uncertainty instability civil unrest or government controls over certain sectors 5 political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international economic policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends or in the export of technology especially between china and the us 6 changes to customs requirements or procedures eg inspections or new or higher tariffs for example on products imported into or exported from the us including under us or other trade laws or measures 7 new nontariff barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements or enforcement of changes to withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements for example the united statesmexicocanada agreement or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products 8 changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly in brazil and argentina and interest rates 9 economic downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate 10 differing local product preferences and product requirements including government certification requirements related to among other things fuel economy vehicle emissions evs and avs connected services and safety 11 impact of changes to and compliance with us and foreign countries’ export controls economic sanctions and other similar measures 12 liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws 13 differing labor regulations agreements requirements and union relationships 14 differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships 15 difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations and 16 natural disasters public health crises including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 and other catastrophic events 

any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products systems components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions supply chain disruptions the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 or catastrophic weather events whether or not as a result of climate change the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers in particular substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from timetotime including at the local facility level which increases our risk of work stoppages we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment 

any disruption in our suppliers’ operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions any number of factors including labor disruptions catastrophic weather events the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 contractual or other disputes unfavorable economic or industry conditions delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including the production of certain higher margin vehicles if the covid19 pandemic continues to spread or reemerges and results in a prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restrictions we could experience continued andor additional global supply disruptions if we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules increase workinprocess inventory or suspend production entirely which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

in particular a global semiconductor supply shortage has had and is continuing to have wideranging effects across multiple industries particularly the automotive industry and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us as a result the semiconductor supply shortage has had and depending on how long it persists could continue to have a material impact on our operations 

the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations pandemics epidemics or disease outbreaks in the us or globally may disrupt our business which could materially affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and future expectations the covid19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause significant disruption to the global economy including the automotive industry and has had a material impact on our business however the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our operations will depend on future developments including the duration and severity of the pandemic any subsequent outbreaks of the virus or any related variants and the efficacy availability and adoption of vaccines future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations in the us and elsewhere in particular if the covid19 pandemic continues or reemerges particularly in north america where our profits are most concentrated resulting in a prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restrictions we could experience among other things 1 continued or additional global supply disruptions including a delayed recovery from the global semiconductor supply shortage 2 labor disruptions 3 an inability to manufacture 4 an inability to sell to our customers 5 a decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic 6 customer defaults on automobile loans and leases 7 lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction and 8 an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets we may also be subject to enhanced legal risks including potential litigation related to the covid19 pandemic we also have substantial cash requirements going forward including 1 ongoing cash costs including payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls the settlements of multidistrict litigation and other recallrelated contingencies payments to service debt and other longterm obligations including mandatory contributions to our pension plans and 2 capital expenditures and payments for engineering and product development activities our ability to meet these cash requirements may be negatively impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic any resulting financial impact or the duration of such impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but the covid19 pandemic could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations going forward 

we may continue to restructure our operations in the us and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions but we may not succeed in doing so since 2017 we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world including the us 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

canada korea southeast asia india africa australia and new zealand and europe as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations which may result in material asset writedowns or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes supplier dealer or other thirdparty litigation regulator claims or proceedings negative publicity and business disruption failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring andor cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and cash flows 

risks related to our intellectual property cybersecurity information technology and data management practices 

competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours and there are no guarantees that gm’s intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services there may be instances where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks if we are found to have infringed any thirdparty intellectual property rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services in addition to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property against third parties any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management’s attention and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action 

security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products including connected vehicles owned or maintained by us gm financial or thirdparties such as vendors or suppliers could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes activities and products additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and proprietary business information including that of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties the secure operation of these systems and products and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products is critical to our business operations and strategy further customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data we also face the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities including vendors service providers suppliers customers counterparties exchanges clearing agents clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries such parties and other third parties who provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems network data or infrastructure despite our security measures and business continuity plans our information technology systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers computer viruses malware including “ransomware” phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to these systems and products the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products such events could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future although impacts of past events have been immaterial the impacts of such events in the future may be material 

security breaches and other disruptions of our invehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products  our vehicles contain complex information technology systems these systems control various vehicle functions including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window door lock functions and battery and electric motors we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent

unauthorized access to these systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties laws that would permit thirdparty access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to thirdparty access without appropriate security measures in place leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation which could adversely impact our business and operating results 

our enterprise data practices including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers employees and suppliers are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions  under these regulations the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties as well as brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future the growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests such as requests to delete disclose and stop selling personal information with significant fines for noncompliance complying with these new laws has significantly increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations 

risks related to government regulations and litigation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive laws regulations and policies including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio particularly regulations relating to fuel economy standards and ghg emissions meeting or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly often technologically challenging and may require phaseout of internal combustion propulsion in certain major jurisdictions and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations laws and policies and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily motivated by efforts to reduce ghg emissions specifically fuel economy and ghg emission regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products subsidize the sale of less profitable ones change our manufacturing processes pay penalties or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense which may be material these requirements may increase the cost of andor diminish demand for our vehicles these regulatory requirements among others could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect our revenues refer to the “environmental and regulatory matters” section of item 1 business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements 

we expect that to comply with fuel economy and ghg emission standards and mandates to sell specific volumes of zev in certain jurisdictions we will be required to sell a significant volume of evs and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all of which will require substantial investment and expense there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technologies especially for evs and the human engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with current or future regulatory requirements 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in addition many of our advanced technologies including avs present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty 

we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings in the us and elsewhere involving various issues including product liability lawsuits warranty litigation class action litigations alleging product defects emissions litigation stockholder litigation labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets in addition we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages fines reputational harm civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as legal and other costs all of which may be significant for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform such as the chevrolet bolt ev recall concerns about the safety of our products including advanced technologies like avs whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delays recalls field actions lost sales governmental investigations regulatory action private claims lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry 

we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities which may not agree with our tax positions in addition our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to automotive financing  gm financial 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency availability and cost of sources of financing including credit facilities securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by chargeoffs delinquencies and prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies competition for customers from commercial banks credit unions and other financing and leasing companies and changes to regulation supervision enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in addition gm financial has certain floatingrate obligations hedging transactions and floatingrate dealer loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to the london interbank offered rate libor the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in march 2021 the ice benchmark administration limited the administrator of libor extended the transition dates of certain libor tenors including all us dollar libor tenors other than oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor tenors to june 30 2023 after which libor reference rates will cease to be provided despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 it is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis after such dates at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance modification or other reforms may have on libor other benchmarks or floatingrate debt instruments including gm financial’s floatingrate debt any such discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on gm financial’s current indebtedness there is a risk that the discontinuation of libor will impact gm financials ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement 

further as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

risks related to defined benefit pension plans 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

factors that affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition

these nongaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance furthermore these nongaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roicadjusted management uses these measures in its financial investment and operational decisionmaking processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes further our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performancebased compensation plans for these reasons we believe these nongaap measures are useful for our investors 

ebitadjusted ebitadjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on longlived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies for ebitadjusted and our other nongaap measures once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item we will also adjust the related nongaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebtadjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment

etradjusted etradjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis etradjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for epsdilutedadjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the us gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict 

roicadjusted roicadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions we define roicadjusted as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roicadjusted average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities exclusive of finance leases average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits opeb liabilities and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period 

adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebitadjusted purposes refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda for additional information

the most significant element of our automotive and other cost of sales is material cost which makes up approximately twothirds of the total amount the remaining portion includes labor costs depreciation and amortization engineering freight and product warranty and recall campaigns 

factors that most significantly influence a regions profitability are industry volume market share and the relative mix of vehicles trucks crossovers cars sold variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost freight the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recallrelated costs vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit refer to the regional sections of this mda for additional information on volume and mix 

in the year ended december 31 2021 unfavorable cost was primarily due to 1 increased material and freight costs of 40 billion 2 increased engineering costs of 20 billion primarily related to accelerating our electric vehicle portfolio and the nonrecurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 3 increased manufacturing costs of 14 billion primarily related to the suspension of production and the nonrecurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 4 increased costs of 11 billion primarily related to parts and accessories 5 increased other employee related costs of 07 billion 6 charges of 03 billion related to potential royalties accrued with respect to past sales partially offset by 7 charges of 07 billion primarily related to dealer restructuring charges property and intangible asset impairments inventory provisions and employee separation charges in australia new zealand thailand and india in 2020 and 8 a decrease in campaign and other warrantyrelated costs of 02 billion which includes chevrolet bolt recall costs of 20 billion and associated recoveries of 19 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 unfavorable other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the canadian dollar and other currencies against the us dollar partially offset by the weakening of the brazilian real and other currencies against the us dollar 

automotive and other selling general and administrative expense 



in the year ended december 31 2021 automotive and other selling general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased advertising administrative and other costs of 12 billion primarily related to the suspension of production and the nonrecurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

general motors company and subsidiaries

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models 

we accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 06 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time incentive programs are generally specific to brand model or sales region and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program forecasted sales volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives a 10 increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue 

gm financial allowance for loan losses the gm financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smallerbalance homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables which have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years gm financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events current conditions and forecast economic performance gm financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables however because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates there can be no assurance that the ultimate chargeoff amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 

gm financial incorporates its outlook on forecast chargeoff recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021 gm financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of december 31 2021 each 5 relative decreaseincrease in the forecast recovery rates would increasedecrease the allowance for loan losses by approximately 01 billion 

at december 31 2021 the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of 18 billion using different possible weightings that gm financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from 18 billion to 19 billion actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by gm financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses 

the gm financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities to provide working capital or to purchase andor finance dealership real estate the allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales there can be no assurance that the ultimate chargeoff amount will not exceed such estimates or that gm financials credit loss assumptions will not increase

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that gm financial owns and has leased to a customer at lease inception an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from two to five years gm financial estimates the expected residual value based on thirdparty data that considers various data points and assumptions including but not limited to recent auction values the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory used vehicle prices manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions 

the customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception 

at december 31 2021 the estimated residual value of gm financials leased vehicles was 291 billion depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in gm financials operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term in 2021 prices on leased vehicles at termination generally exceeded their contractual residual values due to high used vehicle prices accordingly gm financial increased the residual value estimates at december 31 2021 which will result in a prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased vehicles portfolio if used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates gm financial would increase depreciation expense andor record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio if an impairment exists gm financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year make and model recoverability is calculated as the excess of 1 the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value over 2 leased vehicles net less deferred revenue alternatively if used vehicle prices outperform gm financials latest estimates it may record gains on sales of offlease vehicles andor decreased depreciation expense 

the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 relative change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2021 which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments and also may impact return rates if a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge gm financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at december 31 2021 and 2020 

used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels primarily due to low new vehicle inventory in 2022 gm financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels but to remain above prepandemic levels primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in december 2021 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 56 at december 31 2020 to 54 at december 31 2021 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment 

the society of actuaries soa issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31 2021 we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our us pension and opeb plans obligations as of december 31 2021 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 37 billion and 84 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 the yearoveryear change is primarily due to an increase in discount rates and higher than expected asset returns 

the underfunded status of the us pension plans improved in the year ended december 31 2021 to 03 billion from 54 billion primarily due to 1 the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 37 billion 2 the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of 21 billion and 3 changes in actuarial assumptions demographic data updates and contributions of 05 billion partially offset by 4 service and interest costs of 13 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant 



 

a the sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

automotive the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting longshort positions in currency or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2021 our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the us dollar and the canadian dollar chinese yuan korean won brazilian real euro and mexican peso derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2021 

  

the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 07 billion and 09 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been insignificant at december 31 2021 and 2020 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of 42 billion and 22 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of debt and finance leases was 206 billion and 216 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 06 billion and 07 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we had marketable debt securities of 86 billion and 90 billion classified as availableforsale at december 31 2021 and 2020 the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at december 31 2021 and 2020 

equity price risk we are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments the fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was 15 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 our investment in stellantis warrants is valued based on a blackscholes formula we estimate that a 10 adverse change in quoted security prices in stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2021 and 2020 

automotive financing  gm financial 

interest rate risk fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt gm financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance these differences may include tenor yield repricing timing and prepayment expectations typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by gm financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial earn variable interest gm financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging 

quantitative disclosure gm financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below these interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements 

at december 31 2021 gm financial was liabilitysensitive meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets which would initially decrease net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially increase at december 31 2020 gm financial was assetsensitive meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities which would initially increase net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially decrease 

gm financials net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure gm financials hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines the following table presents gm financials net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement 



 

a net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent 

additional model assumptions the sensitivity analysis presented is gm financials best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios however actual results could differ the estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio originations of finance receivables and leases refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives the prepayment projections are based on historical experience if interest rates or other factors change actual prepayment experience could be different than projected

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings as a result gm financial believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at december 31 2021 was insignificant 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of 82 billion and 76 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of 02 billion and an asset of 04 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020

automotive our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments gm north america gmna and gm international gmi gmna meets the demands of customers in north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet and gmc brands gmi primarily meets the demands of customers outside north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet gmc and holden brands we also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries primarily in china with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the baojun buick cadillac chevrolet and wuling brands 

in addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers including daily rental car companies commercial fleet customers leasing companies and governments our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network such as maintenance light repairs collision repairs vehicle accessories and extended service warranties 

refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and note 24 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments 

competitive position and vehicle sales the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design price quality available options safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

we present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to gms dealers and distributors as well as sales to the us government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles which is the largest component of automotive net sales and revenue in the year ended december 31 2020 305 of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the us the following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment vehicles in thousands 



total vehicle sales data represents 1 retail sales ie sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors 2 fleet sales such as sales to large and small businesses governments and daily rental car companies and 3 vehicles used by dealers in their businesses including courtesy transportation vehicles total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for china while total vehicle sales data does not correlate 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles total vehicle sales data represents managements good faith estimate based on sales reported by gms dealers distributors and joint ventures commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available 

the following table summarizes industry and gm total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

in the year ended december 31 2020 we estimate we were the market share leader in north america refer to the overview section in part ii item 7 mda for discussion on changes in market share by region 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

as discussed above total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles certain fleet transactions particularly sales to daily rental car companies are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products 

cyclical and seasonal nature of business the market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending vehicle markets are also seasonal production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries 

relationship with dealers we market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets the number of authorized dealerships were 4697 in gmna and 7661 in gmi at december 31 2020 

we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success given that dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product and business development and intellectual property costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas ghg emissions control improved fuel economy electrification autonomous vehicles and the safety of drivers and passengers research and development expenses were 62 billion 68 billion and 78 billion in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

product development the product development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and propulsion components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments global teams in design program management component  subsystem engineering product integrity safety propulsion systems and purchasing  supply chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale 

our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our global technical center in warren michigan crosssegment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our current vehicle portfolio as we expect that more than 75 of our global sales volume will come from five vehicle architectures by middecade we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals 

battery electric vehicles we have committed to an allelectric future and are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification with a core focus on zero emission battery electric vehicles as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions we currently offer the chevrolet bolt ev which has an

to support mass market adoption of electric vehicles we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive charging solutions for personal vehicles this means strategically addressing charging needs at home the workplace and in public locations for fleet vehicles this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility energy management services we have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter realtime data on their respective networks and charge station health into our energy assist feature within the mychevrolet app currently available to chevrolet bolt ev drivers 

in january 2021 we announced a new business brightdrop which will offer an ecosystem of electric firsttolast mile products software and services designed to help delivery and logistics companies deliver goods more efficiently in addition we plan to invest approximately cad 10 billion to convert our cami manufacturing plant in ingersoll ontario to produce the brightdrop ev600 electric cargo van 

autonomous technology we expect autonomous technology to lead to a future of zero crashes zero emissions and zero congestion we believe that building allelectric vehicles with autonomous capabilities integrated from the beginning rather than through retrofits is the most efficient way to unlock the tremendous potential societal benefits of selfdriving cars in january 2020 the cruise origin was unveiled by cruise which is being codeveloped by gm cruise and honda motor company ltd honda the cruise origin will be built on general motors’ allnew modular architecture powered by the ultium battery system in october 2020 cruise received a permit from the california department of motor vehicles to remove backup drivers from cruise av test vehicles in san francisco and subsequently began truly driverless testing also in october 2020 gm and cruise announced they will file an exemption petition with the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa seeking regulatory approval for the origin’s deployment and have withdrawn an earlier exemption petition that was limited to the cruise avs derived from the chevrolet bolt platform in january 2021 we announced that microsoft corporation microsoft will join us and other investors in a 22 billion investment in cruise cruise may continue to opportunistically seek additional funding in this round in 2021 given the potential of allelectric selfdriving vehicles to help save lives reshape our cities and reduce emissions the goal of cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible with safety being the gating metric 

alternative fuel vehicles we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting ghg emissions in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on ethanolgasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas we offer several 2021 model year flexfuel vehicles in the us and canada to retail and fleet customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we also support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources 

hydrogen fuel cell technology another part of our longterm strategy toward electrification and the reduction of petroleum consumption and ghg emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology we believe hydrogen fuel cells will play an important role in many automotive applications such as commercial vehicles where customers will derive additional benefits from the ability to refuel quickly extended range and suitability for heavier payloads and central refueling of large fleets gm is also evaluating promising fuel cell enduse applications for aerospace stationary backup power and mobile power in addition gm and honda through their longterm strategic alliance to collaborate in research and advanced engineering efforts on fuel cell systems are developing and commercializing fuel cell systems with production scheduled for the early 2020s in january 2021 we announced an agreement to supply our hydrotec fuel cell power cubes to navistar for use in its production model fuel cell electric vehicle

intellectual property we are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries while no single piece of intellectual property is individually material to our business as a whole our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological development additionally we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and precious metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements costs are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodities and the continuing existence of tariffs we purchase systems components and parts from suppliers a global semiconductor supply shortage is having wideranging effects across multiple industries particularly the automotive industry refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of this risk 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 11 of our total purchases in each of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and approximately 12 of our total purchases in the year ended december 31 2018 refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive criteria emissions control our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain nonghg automotive emissions including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world often with very little harmonization while we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers 

the us federal government through the epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us the california air resources board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards these emission control standards will likely increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt california emission standards in lieu of federal requirements fourteen states and the district of columbia have adopted california emission standards and there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california emission requirements in the future 

the canadian federal governments current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with us federal requirements 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavyduty engines will meet emission requirements of the epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and of carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emission requirements 

in 2019 certain areas within china began implementation of the china 6 emission standard china 6 requirements china 6 combines elements of both european union eu and us standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance nationwide implementation of china 6a for new registrations occurred in january 2021 and the more stringent china 6b is expected to be implemented in july 2023 for additional information refer to item 1a risk factors 

brazil has approved a set of national emissions standards referred to as l7 to be implemented in 2022 and l8 to be implemented from 2025 onward l7 standards include exhaust tailpipe gases durability for emissions evaporative emissions and noise limits additional obd requirements and a phasein for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems l8 standards include real drive emission targets for real driving emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031 some of the requirements are aligned with those of the epa 

as a result of the sale of the opelvauxhall business gm’s vehicle presence in europe is smaller but gm may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to opelvauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the opelvauxhall business as well as to other vehicles gm continues to sell in europe in the eu increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards including implementation of real driving emissions tests as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement for example our former german subsidiary has participated in continuing discussions with german and european authorities concerning emissions control systems for additional information refer to note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

automotive fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions in the us nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after considering all available credits for the preceding five model years expected credits for the three succeeding model years and credits obtained from other manufacturers in addition to federal cafe standards the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standards which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle ghg emissions are carbon dioxide emissions that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle in march 2020 the epa and nhtsa issued a rule setting fuel economy and ghg emissions standards for the lightduty vehicles through the 2026 model year which is currently being challenged through litigation on january 25 2021 president biden issued executive order 13990 directing the epa and nhtsa to by july 2021 consider publishing a proposed rule suspending revising or rescinding those standards and has also permitted the department of justice to seek to stay or dispose of litigation challenging those standards the epa and nhtsa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emissions of medium and heavyduty vehicles imposing more stringent standards over time 

in addition carb has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards for motor vehicles and other states have asserted the right to adopt carbs standards carb regulations previously stated that compliance with the epa lightduty program is deemed compliance with carb standards however on december 12 2018 carb amended this regulation to state that in the event the epa were to alter federal ghg stringency which it now has compliance with the epas ghg emissions standards will no longer be deemed compliance with carbs separate requirements in september 2019 nhtsa and the epa issued a rule asserting that california is preempted from regulating ghg emissions which is currently being challenged through litigation as a result depending on the outcome of the federal cafe and ghg rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of carbs regulatory amendment in the future gm might be required to meet california ghg standards that are different than the epa standards 

carb has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of zero emission vehicles zevs must be sold in california the clean air act permits states to adopt california emission standards and 11 have adopted the zev requirements in september 2019 the epa revoked the waiver it had granted to california that permitted its zev program and nhtsa also asserted preemption of californias zev program both the epa and nhtsas actions are currently being challenged through litigation depending on the outcome of that litigation there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california zev requirements in the future 

on january 25 2021 president biden issued executive order 13990 directing epa and nhtsa to by april 2021 consider publishing a proposed rule suspending revising or rescinding epa and nhtsas september 2019 actions and has also permitted the department of justice to stay or dispose of litigation related to preemption of state ghg and zev standards on 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

february 1 2021 the department of justice filed a motion seeking to hold these preemption cases in abeyance pending implementation of executive order 13990 

in canada light and heavyduty ghg regulations are currently patterned after the epa ghg emissions standards however the canadian government is conducting a midterm review of its 2022 to 2025 model year lightduty ghg standards and there is an increased risk that future canadian lightduty ghg regulations may not be aligned with the revised epa regulations in addition the canadian province of quebec has zev requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on california program requirements the province of british columbia also finalized similar zev regulations in july 2020 that cover the 2020 to 2039 model years there is also the risk that the federal government or other provinces in canada may pursue the implementation of additional zev requirements in the future 

china has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement with a focus on the fleet average program the current china phase 4 fleet average fuel consumption requirement which went into effect in 2016 is based on curb weight with full compliance required by 2020 china phase 4 has continued subsidies for plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles which are referred to as new energy vehicles nevs subsidies for nev have been extended to the end of 2022 china phase 5 has been developed with a planned start in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025 in addition china has established an nev mandate that will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of nevs to generate credits in 2019 and beyond to offset internal combustion engine vehicle production volume the number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency with the goal of increasing nev volume penetrations uncommitted nev credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement china has issued nev credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new nev credit targets aiming at further increasing volumes of nevs in 2024 and 2025 

in brazil the secretary of industry and development promulgates and enforces cafe standards and has enforced a new cafe program for the period october 2020 to september 2026 and october 2026 to september 2032 for lightduty and midsize trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs including diesel vehicles imposing more stringent standards for each period 

regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations if regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce standards that are misaligned with market conditions we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for certain vehicles and curtail production of others in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulations 

industrial environmental control our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment we are embracing sustainability programs focused on reducing ghg emissions water consumption and discharge and waste disposal at december 31 2020 81 of waste materials generated in our manufacturing facilities across the globe are composted reused or recycled we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 10 million metric tons of waste from landfills in 2020 and resulted in 46 million metric tons of ghg emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations 

in addition to reducing our impact on the environment our waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of raw materials and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we are committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by 2035 pulling forward our previous commitment by five years and plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations supported by a commitment to sciencebased targets in addition to our carbon goals the company worked with the environmental defense fund to develop a shared vision of an allelectric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new lightduty vehicles by 2035 through december 31 2020 we implemented projects and signed renewable energy contracts globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by 2023 which represents approximately 60 of our us electricity use and over 40 of our global electricity use in 2019 we executed our largest 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

green tariff to date with dte energy company sourcing 300000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that will begin supplying us in early 2021 additionally in 2020 we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date with 180 megawatts of solar electricity supplying our us operations starting in 2023 we continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in 2020 energy star certified two assembly plants one in canada through natural resources canada and one in the us as well as five buildings in the us for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at six additional sites by reducing energy intensity an average of 14 at these sites within three years to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 within a five year period in total 69 gmowned manufacturing sites have met the epa challenge with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 129 recognitions additionally we received recognition from the us department of energy doe of 50001 ready status for 25 facilities the us doe 50001 ready program is a selfguided approach for facilities to establish an energy management system and selfattest to the structure of iso 50001 a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial commercial and institutional facilities these sustainability efforts reduce our operational expenses and are part of our approach to improve the sustainability of our operations by aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goals and reduction targets collecting accurate data and publicly reporting progress against our targets 

chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

globally governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaties and initiatives such as the stockholm basel and rotterdam conventions on chemicals and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries in addition more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to vehicle interior air quality 

chemical regulations are increasing in north america in the us the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act and several us states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design such as the california and washington laws banning the use of copper in brake friction material chemical restrictions in canada continue to steadily progress as a result of environment and climate change canadas chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic 

china prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles there are also various regulations in china stipulating the requirements for chemical management among other things these regulations restrict the use import and export of various chemical substances the failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the china market 

these emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates 

vehicle safety 

us requirements the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 the safety act regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell the safety act prohibits the sale in the united states of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and nongovernmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex and lack harmonization globally the safety act further requires that if we or nhtsa determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles should we or nhtsa determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

other national requirements outside of the us many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional more stringent requirements in the future the european general safety regulation has introduced unece regulations which are required for the european type approval process globally governments generally have been adopting unece based regulations with some variations to address local concerns any difference between north american and unece based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity new safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world including in china brazil and gulf cooperation council countries also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally in canada vehicle regulatory requirements are currently aligned with us regulations however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act recall thresholds are different and the minister of transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or noncompliance when the minister considers it to be in the interest of safety further various governments are beginning to mandate ecall and other features that can be marketspecific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally 

crash test ratings and new car assessment programs organizations in various regions around the world including in the us rate and compare motor vehicles through various new car assessment programs ncaps to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles ncaps use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations and use stars to rate vehicle safety with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest achieving high ncap ratings which can vary by country and region can add complexity and cost to vehicles

 item 1a risk factors 

we have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us these risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence 

risks related to our competition and strategy 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry our business could suffer we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years particularly as traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers oems shift resources to the development of electric vehicles in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies products services directtoconsumer sales channels methods of transportation and vehicle ownership it is a strategic imperative that we succeed in driving the technological disruption occurring in our industry including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous vehicles to successfully execute our longterm strategy we must continue to develop new products and services including products and services that are outside of our historically core business such as autonomous and electric vehicles digital services and transportation as a service the process of designing and developing new technology products and services is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models including electric vehicles that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models including electric vehicles that preserve our reputation for designing building and selling safe highquality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability the new vehicle development process generally takes two years or more and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions infrastructure and changes in quality safety reliability and styling demands and preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our nearterm profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of fullsize suvs and pickup trucks while we offer a portfolio of cars crossovers suvs and trucks and we have announced significant plans to design build and sell a broad portfolio of electric vehicles we currently recognize higher profit margins on our suvs and trucks our nearterm success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any nearterm shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuelefficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability concerns about climate change or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles more stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality innovation new technologies pricing fuel economy reliability safety customer service and financial services offered additionally overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds current demand many manufacturers including gm have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs in light of such excess capacity and high fixed costs many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices as a result we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result in vehicle prices that do not offset cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations which could affect our profitability our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness 

manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a lowcost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

our longterm strategy is dependent upon our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will drive consumer adoption the production and profitable sale of electric vehicles has become increasingly important to our longterm business as we accelerate our transition to an allelectric future in 2020 we announced the commitment of 27 billion in investments in electric and autonomous vehicle technologies through 2025 with plans to launch 30 new electric vehicle models globally in that timeframe our electric vehicle strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of electric vehicles increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries license and monetize our proprietary platforms develop new software and services and leverage our scale manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing internal combustion engine vehicles in addition consumer adoption of electric vehicles will be critical to the success of our strategy consumer adoption of electric vehicles could be impacted by numerous factors including the breadth of the portfolio of electric vehicles available perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost relative to internal combustion engine vehicles the range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a full battery charge availability of high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of fuel government regulations and economic incentives and the proliferation of a robust openstandard electric vehicle charging ecosystem if we are unable to successfully deliver on our electric vehicle strategy it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks in recent years we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies including in gm cruise holdings llc cruise holdings our majorityowned subsidiary that is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including our ability to continue to develop selfdriving software and hardware such as light detection and ranging lidar sensors and other components access to sufficient capital including with respect to additional softbank funding risks related to the manufacture of purposebuilt autonomous vehicles and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny and further regulation and it could deter consumer adoption of autonomous vehicle technology any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

risks related to our operations 

the covid19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations pandemics epidemics or disease outbreaks in the us or globally may disrupt our business which could materially affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and future expectations the covid19 outbreak has caused significant disruption to the global economy including the automotive industry and has had a material impact on our business as discussed in detail in part ii item 7 mda however the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our operations will depend on future developments including the duration and severity of the outbreak any subsequent outbreaks and the timing and efficacy of any available vaccines future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations in the us and elsewhere in particular if 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

covid19 continues to spread or reemerges particularly in north america where our profits are most concentrated resulting in a prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restrictions we could experience among other things 1 global supply disruptions 2 labor disruptions 3 an inability to manufacture 4 an inability to sell to our customers 5 a decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic 6 customer defaults on automobile loans and leases 7 lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction and 8 an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets we may also be subject to enhanced legal risks including potential litigation related to the covid19 pandemic we also have substantial cash requirements going forward including 1 ongoing cash costs including payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls the settlements of multidistrict litigation and other recallrelated contingencies payments to service debt and other longterm obligations including mandatory contributions to our pension plans and 2 capital expenditures and payments for engineering and product development activities our ability to meet these cash requirements may be negatively impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but the covid19 pandemic could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations going forward for a further discussion of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section in part ii item 7 mda 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales including the availability and prices of used vehicles levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence real estate values political unrest the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness including covid19 see “the covid19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations” in this item 1a risk factors barriers to trade and other global economic conditions for a discussion of economic and market trends see the overview section in part ii item 7 mda 

our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational competitive and regulatory risks maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as nontraditional market participants such as domestic technology companies in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to electric vehicles infotainment and other new technologies our ability to fully deploy our technologies in china may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the us and china increased competition increased uschina trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in china among other things may result in price reductions reduced sales profitability and margins and challenges to gain or hold market share in addition chinese regulators have implemented increasingly aggressive “green” policy initiatives requiring oems to reduce the average emissions and average fuel consumption of their products and to achieve quotas for the sale of electric vehicles which have challenging lead times 

certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market at times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit many of our operations primarily in china and korea as well as our battery manufacturing operations with lg chem are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners interests in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive actions or we may be subject to penalties fines or other punitive actions for these activities

the international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and a variety of other political economic and regulatory risks including 1 changes in government leadership 2 changes in labor employment tax privacy environmental and other laws regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives 3 political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials services components systems and parts or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives 4 political instability civil unrest or government controls over certain sectors 5 political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends or in the export of technology especially between china and the us 6 more detailed inspections or new or higher tariffs for example on products imported into or exported from the us including under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 section 301 of the us trade act of 1974 or other trade measures 7 new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements including changes to withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements for example the united statesmexicocanada agreement or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products 8 changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly in brazil and argentina and interest rates 9 economic downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate 10 differing local product preferences and product requirements including government certification requirements related to among other things fuel economy vehicle emissions and safety 11 impact of changes to and compliance with us and foreign countries’ export controls economic sanctions and other similar measures 12 liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws 13 differing labor regulations requirements and union relationships 14 differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships 15 difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations and 16 natural disasters public health crises including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 see “the covid19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations” in this item 1a risk factors and other catastrophic events 

any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products systems components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 see “the covid19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations” in this item 1a risk factors or catastrophic weather events the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers in particular substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from timetotime often at the local facility level which increases our risk of work stoppages we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment 

any disruption in our suppliers’ operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions any number of factors including labor disruptions catastrophic weather events the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as covid19 see “the covid19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations” in this item 1a risk factors contractual or other disputes unfavorable economic or industry conditions delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including the production of certain higher margin vehicles if the covid19 pandemic continues to spread or reemerges and results in a prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restrictions we could experience continued andor additional global supply disruptions if we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely which could cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in particular a global semiconductor supply shortage is having wideranging effects across multiple industries particularly the automotive industry and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us as a result the semiconductor supply shortage has had and will continue to have an impact on our vehicle production and we anticipate it will have a material impact on our performance in 2021 

high prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability increases in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products systems components and parts such as steel precious metals nonferrous metals critical minerals or other similar raw materials may lead to higher production costs for parts components and vehicles changes in trade policies and tariffs fluctuations in supply and demand and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs 

we may continue to restructure our operations in the us and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions but we may not succeed in doing so since 2017 we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world including the us canada korea southeast asia india australia and new zealand and europe as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations which may result in material asset writedowns or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs in addition these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes supplier dealer or other thirdparty litigation regulator claims or proceedings negative publicity and business disruption failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring andor cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and cash flows 

risks related to our intellectual property cybersecurity information technology and data management practices 

competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours and there are no guarantees that gm’s intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services there may be instances where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks if we are found to have infringed any thirdparty intellectual property rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services 

security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products including connected vehicles owned or maintained by us gm financial or thirdparty vendors or suppliers on our behalf could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes activities and products additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and proprietary business information including that of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties the secure operation of these systems and products and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products is critical to our business operations and strategy further customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data despite security measures and business continuity plans these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers computer viruses malware including “ransomware” phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to these systems and products the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products such events could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

compliant with applicable laws or regulations subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies we have experienced such events in the past and although past events were immaterial future events may occur and may be material 

security breaches and other disruptions of our invehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products  our vehicles contain complex information technology systems these systems control various vehicle functions including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock functions we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties new laws such as the new data law in massachusetts that would permit thirdparty access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to thirdparty access without appropriate security measures in place leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation which could impact our business and operating results 

our enterprise data practices including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers employees and suppliers are subject to increasingly complex restrictive and punitive regulations in all key market regions  under these regulations the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties as well as brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services because many of these laws are new there is little clarity as to their interpretation as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future for example the california consumer protection act became effective in 2020 obligating companies to quickly respond to consumer requests to delete disclose and stop selling personal information of california residents with significant fines for noncompliance other us states are considering similar laws with some considering private rights of action for consumers that would allow consumers to bring claims directly against gm for mishandling their data in europe in 2020 the court of justice for the eu invalidated mechanisms for transferring personal information out of the eu leading to a wave of potential new barriers for data sharing between the eu and among other countries the us in canada both the federal government and certain provinces have also proposed new legislation imposing significant and unprecedented obligations fines and liabilities regarding data handling overcoming these new barriers is likely to increase our costs and drive new complexity in our operations 

risks related to government regulations and litigation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive laws regulations and policies including those related to vehicle emissions fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio particularly regulations relating to emissions fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging especially because the standards are not harmonized across jurisdictions we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations laws and policies and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily out of concern for the environment including concerns about global climate change and its impact these government regulatory requirements among others could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect our revenues refer to the “environmental and regulatory matters” section of item 1 business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements 

we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased costs there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technologies and the human engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time there is no 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of safety fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

in addition many of our advanced technologies including autonomous vehicles present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty 

we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits class action litigations alleging product defects emissions litigation both in the us and elsewhere stockholder litigation labor and employment litigation in various countries including us canada korea and brazil claims and actions arising from restructurings divestitures of operations and assets and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines significant reputational harm civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform concerns about the safety of our products including advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delays recalls lost sales governmental investigations regulatory action private claims lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry 

we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities which may not agree with our tax positions in addition our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to automotive financing  gm financial 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers globally gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency availability and cost of sources of financing including credit facilities securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by chargeoffs delinquencies and prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies competition for customers from commercial banks credit unions and other financing and leasing companies and changes to regulation supervision enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions 

in addition a substantial portion of gm financial’s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates primarily based on usdlibor the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance modification or other reforms may have on libor other benchmarks or floating–rate debt instruments including gm financial’s floating–rate debt any such discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on gm financial’s current or future indebtedness there is a risk that the discontinuation of libor will impact gm financials ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement 

further as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

risks related to defined benefit pension plans 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

factors that affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition

we accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable which is generally at the time of sale 

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 04 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time incentive programs are generally specific to brand model or sales region and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program forecasted sales volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives a 10 increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately 03 billion subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue 

gm financial allowance for loan losses the gm financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smallerbalance homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables which have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years we forecast net credit losses based on relevant information about past events current conditions and forecast economic performance we believe that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables however because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates there can be no assurance that the ultimate chargeoff amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 

gm financial incorporates assumptions about forecast chargeoff recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate used vehicle prices rebounded in the second half of 2020 after decreasing in march and april 2020 and recoveries outperformed the forecast therefore gm financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of december 31 2020 each 5 relative decreaseincrease in the forecast recovery rates could increasedecrease our allowance for loan losses by approximately 01 billion 

gm financial updated its forecast of economic performance in march 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic and has continued to monitor and update the forecast through december 31 2020 at december 31 2020 the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of 19 billion using different possible weightings that gm financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from 18 billion to 20 billion actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by gm financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses 

the gm financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities to provide working capital and to purchase andor finance dealership real estate the allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is also based on estimates that effective january 1 2020 include historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales there can be no assurance that the ultimate chargeoff amount will not exceed such estimates or that gm financials credit loss assumptions will not increase 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from two to five years at lease inception an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on thirdparty data that considers various data points and assumptions including but not limited to recent auction values the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles used vehicle prices manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions the customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands 



at december 31 2020 the estimated residual value of gm financials leased vehicles was 292 billion depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in gm financials operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term 

gm financial updated the residual value estimates on the operating lease portfolio to reflect the decrease in forecasted used vehicle prices in march 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic and has continued to monitor and update the residual value estimates through december 31 2020 used vehicle prices rebounded in the second half of 2020 after decreasing in march and april 2020 and sales proceeds on terminated leased vehicles outperformed the residual value estimates during the year ended december 31 2020 accordingly gm financial increased the residual value estimates at december 31 2020 which will result in a prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio if used vehicle prices decrease gm financial would increase depreciation expense andor record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio if an impairment exists gm financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year make and model recoverability is calculated as the excess of 1 the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value over 2 leased vehicles net less deferred revenue alternatively if used vehicle prices outperform gm financials latest estimates it may record gains on sales of offlease vehicles andor decreased depreciation expense 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 relative change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2020 which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments and also may impact return rates if a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge gm financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at december 31 2020 and 2019 

used vehicle prices increased approximately 3 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to low new vehicle inventory largely driven by the suspension of manufacturing operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic creating strong demand for used vehicles in 2021 gm financial expects used vehicle prices to decline by an amount in the low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2020 levels as supply and demand dynamics normalize 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2020 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 59 at december 31 2019 to 56 at december 31 2020 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment 

the society of actuaries soa issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31 2020 we incorporated these soa mortality improvement tables into our december 31 2020 measurement of us pension and opeb plans benefit obligations the change in these assumptions decreased the december 31 2020 us pension and opeb plans’ obligations by 07 billion 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 84 billion and 67 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 the yearoveryear change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the underfunded status of the us pension plans remained unchanged in the year ended december 31 2020 at 54 billion primarily due to 1 the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of 56 billion and 2 service and interest costs of 19 billion partially offset by 3 a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 66 billion and 4 changes in mortality improvement assumptions and demographic gains of 09 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions and governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

automotive the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting longshort positions in currency or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2020 our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the us dollar and the canadian dollar korean won euro chinese yuan brazilian real and mexican peso derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are primarily used to hedge 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2020 

  

the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 09 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 01 billion and 02 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of 22 billion and 51 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of debt and finance leases was 216 billion and 159 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 07 billion and 06 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 

we had marketable debt securities of 90 billion and 42 billion classified as availableforsale at december 31 2020 and 2019 the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2020 and 2019 

equity price risk we are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in psa warrants the fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was 12 billion and 15 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 our investment in psa warrants is valued based on a blackscholes formula we estimate that a 10 adverse change in quoted security prices in psa group would impact our investment by 01 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 

automotive financing  gm financial 

interest rate risk fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt gm financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance these differences may include tenor yield repricing timing and prepayment expectations typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by gm financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial earn variable interest gm financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging 

quantitative disclosure gm financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the table below these interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements 

at december 31 2020 gm financial was assetsensitive meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities which would initially increase net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially decrease at december 31 2019 gm financial was liabilitysensitive meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets which would initially decrease net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially increase 

gm financials net interest income sensitivity increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive asset exposure relative to rate sensitive liability exposure gm financials hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines the following table presents gm financials net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement 



 

a net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent 

additional model assumptions the sensitivity analysis presented is gm financials best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios however actual results could differ the estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio originations of finance receivables and leases refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives the prepayment projections are based on historical experience if interest rates or other factors change actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings as a result gm financial believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at december 31 2020 was insignificant 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of 76 billion and 62 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was an asset of 04 billion and an insignificant amount at december 31 2020 and 2019

automotive our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments gm north america gmna and gm international gmi gmna meets the demands of customers in north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet and gmc brands gmi primarily meets the demands of customers outside north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet gmc and holden brands we also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries primarily in china with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the baojun buick cadillac chevrolet and wuling brands 

in addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers including daily rental car companies commercial fleet customers leasing companies and governments our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network such as maintenance light repairs collision repairs vehicle accessories and extended service warranties 

competitive position and vehicle sales the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design price quality available options safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

we present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to gms dealers and distributors as well as sales to the us government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles which is the largest component of automotive net sales and revenue in the year ended december 31 2019 34 of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the us the following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment vehicles in thousands 



total vehicle sales data represents 1 retail sales ie sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors 2 fleet sales such as sales to large and small businesses governments and daily rental car companies and 3 vehicles used by dealers in their businesses including courtesy transportation vehicles total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for china while total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles total vehicle sales data represents managements good faith estimate based on sales reported by gms dealers distributors and joint ventures commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available

the following table summarizes total industry vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands 



 

 

in the year ended december 31 2019  we estimate we were the market share leader in each of north america and south america and had the number four market share in the asiapacific middle east and africa region which included the number two market share in china refer to the overview in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda for discussion on changes in market share by region 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

as discussed above total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles certain fleet transactions particularly sales to daily rental car companies are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products 

cyclical and seasonal nature of business the market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending vehicle markets are also seasonal production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries 

relationship with dealers we market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets the number of authorized dealerships were 4743 in gmna and 7907 in gmi at december 31 2019 

we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success given that dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product and business development and intellectual property costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas ghg emissions control improved fuel economy electrification autonomous vehicles the safety of drivers and passengers and urban mobility research and development expenses were 68 billion  78 billion and 73 billion in the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

product development the product development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and propulsion components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments global teams in design program management component  subsystem engineering product integrity safety propulsion systems and purchasing  supply chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale 

our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our global technical center in warren michigan crosssegment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our current vehicle portfolio as we expect that more than 75 of our global sales volume will come from five vehicle architectures by middecade we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals 

battery electric vehicles we have committed to an allelectric future and are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification with a core focus on zero emission battery electric vehicles as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions we currently offer the chevrolet bolt ev which recently improved to 259 

general motors company and subsidiaries

autonomous technology we expect autonomous technology to lead to a future of zero crashes zero emissions and zero congestion we are among the leaders in the industry with significant global realworld experience in delivering connectivity and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology an example of our advanced technology is super cruise a driver assistance feature that enables handsfree driving on the highway which will be expanded to all cadillac models we are actively testing autonomous vehicles in the us gated by safety and regulation we continue to make significant progress toward commercialization of a network of ondemand autonomous vehicles in the us the cruise av is our productionintent selfdriving vehicle that was engineered from the start to operate safely on its own with no driver 

alternative fuel vehicles we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting ghg emissions in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on ethanolgasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas we offer several 2020 model year flexfuel vehicles in the us and canada to retail and fleet customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we also support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources 

hydrogen fuel cell technology another part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than three million miles of realworld driving these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology we are exploring nontraditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas including demonstrations with the us army and us navy in addition we signed a codevelopment agreement and established a nonconsolidated joint venture with honda motor co ltd honda for a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for commercialization in the early 2020s 

onstar and vehicle connectivity we offer onstar and connected services to more than 22 million connected vehicles globally through subscriptionbased and complimentary services onstar provides safety and security services for retail and fleet customers including automatic crash response emergency services roadside assistance crisis assist stolen vehicle assistance and turnbyturn navigation we also offer a variety of connected services including mobile applications for owners to remotely control their vehicles and electric vehicle owners to locate charging stations ondemand vehicle diagnostics gm smart driver gm marketplace invehicle commerce connected navigation siriusxm with 360l and 4g lte wireless connectivity additionally we have announced plans to integrate an invehicle alexa experience through amazoncom to millions of eligible model year 2018 and newer vehicles in 2020 and integrate google voice assistant navigation and app ecosystem into gm infotainment systems beginning in 2021 

intellectual property we are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries while no single piece of intellectual property is 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

individually material to our business as a whole our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological development additionally we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements costs are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodities and the continuing existence of tariffs 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were 11 of our total purchases in the year ended december 31 2019 and 12 of our total purchases in each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive criteria emissions control our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain nonghg automotive emissions including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world often with very little harmonization while we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers 

the us federal government through the environmental protection agency epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us the california air resources board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards these emission control standards will likely increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt california emission standards in lieu of federal requirements fourteen states and the district of columbia have adopted california emission standards and there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california emission requirements in the future 

the canadian federal governments current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with those of the us federal requirements 

each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavyduty engines will meet emission requirements of the epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and of carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emission requirements 

in 2019 certain areas within china began implementation of the china 6 emission standard china 6 requirements china 6 combines elements of both european union eu and us standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance nationwide implementation of china 6a for new registrations is expected in july 2020 and the more stringent china 6b is expected to be implemented in july 2023 localities can implement china 6 requirements earlier than the nationwide deadlines if certain enabling criteria are met for additional information refer to item 1a risk factors 

brazil has recently approved a new set of national emissions standards named l7 to be implemented in 2022 and l8 to be implemented in 2025 l7 standards include exhaust durability evaporative and noise limits new obd requirements and a phasein for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems l8 standards include emission targets for real driving emissions and reduce exhaust limits every two years until 2031 many of the requirements are aligned with those of the epa 

as a result of the sale of the opelvauxhall business gm’s vehicle presence in europe is smaller but gm may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to opelvauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the opelvauxhall business as well as to other vehicles gm continues to sell in europe in the eu increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards including implementation of real driving emissions tests as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement for example our former german subsidiary has participated in 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

continuing discussions with german and european authorities concerning emissions control systems for additional information refer to note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

automotive fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions in the us the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after considering all available credits for the preceding five model years expected credits for the three succeeding model years and credits obtained from other manufacturers the amount of these civil penalties is the subject of litigation currently pending in the us court of appeals for the second circuit in addition to federal cafe standards the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standards which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle ghg emissions are carbon dioxide emissions that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle the epa and nhtsa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emissions of medium and heavyduty vehicles imposing more stringent standards over time 

in addition carb has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards for motor vehicles and other states have asserted the right to adopt carbs standards carb regulations previously stated that compliance with the epa lightduty program is deemed compliance with carb standards however on december 12 2018 carb amended this regulation to state that in the event the epa alters federal ghg stringency compliance with the epas ghg emissions standards will no longer be deemed compliance with carbs separate requirements likewise nhtsa and the epa have recently issued a rule asserting that california is preempted from regulating ghg emissions which is currently being challenged through litigation as a result depending on the outcome of the federal cafe and ghg rulemaking and related litigation and the finality of carbs regulatory amendment in the future gm might be required to meet california ghg standards that are different than the epa standards 

carb has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of zero emission vehicles zevs must be sold in california the clean air act permits states to adopt california emission standards and 11 have adopted the zev requirements the epa has recently revoked the waiver it had granted to california that permitted its zev program depending on the finality of that revocation there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california zev requirements in the future 

in canada light and heavyduty ghg regulations are currently patterned after the epa ghg emissions standards however the canadian government will be conducting a midterm review of its 2022 to 2025 model year lightduty ghg standards and there is an increased risk that future canadian lightduty ghg regulations may not be aligned with the epa regulations in addition the canadian province of quebec has adopted zev requirements for the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on california program requirements the province of british columbia also passed legislation in may 2019 to enable similar zev regulations in the near term and governments in canada could adopt additional zev requirements in the future 

china has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement with a focus on the fleet average program the current china phase 4 fleet average fuel consumption requirement which went into effect in 2016 is based on curb weight with full compliance required by 2020 china phase 4 has continued subsidies for plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles which are referred to as new energy vehicles nevs china phase 5 has been developed with a planned start in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025 in addition china has established an nev mandate that will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of nevs to generate credits in 2019 and beyond to offset internal combustion engine vehicle production volume the number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency with the goal of increasing nev volume penetrations uncommitted nev credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement china has set forth nev credit targets for 2019 and 2020 and is setting forth new nev credit targets aiming at further increasing volumes of nevs between 2021 and 2025 

in brazil the secretary of industry and development promulgates and enforces cafe standards and has recently enforced a new cafe program for the period october 2020 to september 2026 and october 2026 to september 2032 for lightduty and midsize trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs including diesel vehicles imposing more stringent standards for each period 

regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations if regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce standards that are misaligned with market conditions we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for certain vehicles and curtail production of others in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulations 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

industrial environmental control our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment we are converting as many of our worldwide operations as practicable to landfillfree operations which reduces ghg emissions associated with waste disposal at december 31 2019  58 or 45 of our manufacturing operations and 36 or 38 of our nonmanufacturing operations were landfillfree at our landfillfree manufacturing operations 90 of waste materials are composted reused or recycled and 8 are converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 12 million metric tons of waste from landfills in 2019 resulting in 56 million metric tons of ghg emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations including construction demolition and remediation wastes 

in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of material and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we are committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by 2040 pulling forward our previous commitment by 10 years through december 31 2019  we implemented projects and signed renewable energy contracts globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over 400 megawatts which represents approximately 20 of our global electricity use in 2019 we executed our largest green tariff to date with dte energy company sourcing 300000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that will begin supplying us in early 2021 we continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in 2019 energy star certified one assembly plant in canada through natural resources canada and eight buildings in the us for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at two additional sites globally by reducing energy intensity an average of 11 at these sites within two years to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 within a five year period in total 73 gmowned manufacturing sites have met the epa challenge with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 131 recognitions additionally we received recognition from the us department of energy doe of 50001 ready status for 27 facilities the us doe 50001 ready program is a selfguided approach for facilities to establish an energy management system and selfattest to the structure of iso 50001 a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial commercial and institutional facilities these efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to address climate change by setting a ghg emissions reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan to operate more efficiently and publicly reporting progress against our target 

chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

globally governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaties and initiatives such as the stockholm basel and rotterdam conventions on chemicals and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries in addition more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to vehicle interior air quality 

chemical regulations are increasing in north america in the us the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act and several us states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design such as the california and washington laws banning the use of copper in brake friction material chemical restrictions in canada continue to steadily progress as a result of environment and climate change canadas chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic 

china prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles there are also various regulations in china stipulating the requirements for chemical management among other things these regulations restrict the use import and export of various chemical substances the failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the china market 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

these emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates 

safety in the us the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the us that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by nhtsa if we or nhtsa determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures adding complexity to regulatory compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

we have listed below the most significant risk factors applicable to us these risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry our business could suffer we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies products services and methods of travel and vehicle ownership it is strategically significant that we succeed in leading the technological disruption occurring in our industry including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous vehicles in a rideshare environment to successfully execute our longterm strategy we must continue to develop new products and services including products and services that are outside of our historically core business such as autonomous and electric vehicles digital services and transportation as a service the process of designing and developing new technology products and services is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models that preserve our reputation for designing building and selling safe highquality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions and changes in quality safety reliability and styling demands and preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our profitability is dependent upon the success of suvs and fullsize pickup trucks while we offer a portfolio of cars crossovers suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our suvs and trucks our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles more stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles 

we may continue to restructure our operations in the us and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions but we may not succeed in doing so since 2017 we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world including the us canada korea and europe as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations which may result in material asset writedowns or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs for example we are continuing to execute on the transformation actions we announced in 2018 to drive significant cost efficiencies and realign our current manufacturing capacity with demand while we have achieved significant cost savings there is no guarantee that we will fully realize the anticipated savings or benefits from past or future restructuring andor cost reduction actions within the time periods we expect or at all in addition these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes supplier dealer or other thirdparty litigation regulator claims or proceedings negative publicity and business disruption failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring andor cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our electric vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles as well as increased consumer adoption we anticipate that the production and profitable sale of electric vehicles will become increasingly 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

important to our business if we are unable to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of batteryelectric vehicles it may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition our ability to benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and sale of electric vehicles has been reduced and in some jurisdictions eliminated or exhausted which may negatively affect our ability to profitably sell electric vehicles in addition our sale of electric vehicles is dependent on consumer adoption which could be impacted by numerous factors including perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of fuel government regulations and economic incentives and access to charging facilities 

our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks in recent years we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies including in gm cruise holdings llc cruise holdings our majorityowned subsidiary that is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including our ability to continue to develop selfdriving software and hardware such as light detection and ranging lidar sensors and other components access to sufficient capital including with respect to additional softbank funding risks related to the manufacture of purposebuilt autonomous vehicles and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny and further regulation any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values the availability and prices of used vehicles levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as the novel coronavirus barriers to trade and other global economic conditions while we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty we expect us and china industry sales volumes to be lower in 2020 relative to 2019 for a discussion of economic and market trends see the overview section of the mda 

our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational competitive and regulatory risks maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as nontraditional market participants such as domestic technology companies in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to infotainment and other new technologies increased competition increased uschina trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in china among other things may result in price reductions reduced sales profitability and margins and challenges to gain or hold market share chinese regulators have implemented increasingly aggressive “green” policy initiatives and recommended quotas for the sale of electric vehicles which have challenging lead times 

certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market at times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit many of our operations primarily in china and korea are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners interests in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge our success in the 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties fines or other related actions for these activities 

the international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and a variety of other political economic and regulatory risks including 1 changes in government leadership 2 changes in labor employment tax privacy environmental and other laws regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives 3 political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials services components systems and parts or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives 4 political instability civil unrest or government controls over certain sectors 5 political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends especially between china or canada and the us 6 more detailed inspections or new or higher tariffs for example on products imported into or exported from the us including under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 section 301 of the us trade act of 1974 or other trade measures 7 new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements including changes to withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements for example the north american free trade agreement or its successor the united statesmexicocanada agreement or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products 8 changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly in brazil and argentina and interest rates 9 economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate 10 differing local product preferences and product requirements including government certification requirements related to among other things fuel economy vehicle emissions and safety 11 impact of compliance with us and foreign countries’ export controls and economic sanctions 12 liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws 13 differing labor regulations requirements and union relationships 14 differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships 15 difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations and 16 natural disasters public health crises including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as the novel coronavirus and other catastrophic events 

any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products systems components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as the novel coronavirus or catastrophic weather events the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers in particular substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from timetotime often at the local facility level which increases our risk of work stoppages we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment 

any disruption in our suppliers’ operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions any number of factors including 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

labor disruptions catastrophic weather events the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as the novel coronavirus contractual or other disputes unfavorable economic or industry conditions delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including the production of certain higher margin vehicles in particular if the current novel coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel commercial and other similar restrictions we could experience global supply disruptions if we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely which could cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations 

high prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability increases in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products systems components and parts such as steel precious metals or nonferrous metals including aluminum copper and plastic may lead to higher production costs for parts components and vehicles changes in trade policies and tariffs fluctuations in supply and demand and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality innovation new technologies pricing fuel economy reliability safety customer service and financial services offered additionally overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds current demand many manufacturers including gm have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs in light of such excess capacity and high fixed costs many of our competitors have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices as a result we may be required to offer similar incentives which may not necessarily allow us to set vehicle prices that offset cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness 

manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a lowcost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours and there are no guarantees that gm’s intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services there may be instances where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks if we are found to have infringed any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services 

security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products including connected vehicles owned or maintained by us gm financial or thirdparty vendors or suppliers on our behalf could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes activities and products additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and proprietary business information including that of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

employees in data centers and on information technology networks including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties the secure operation of these systems and products and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products is critical to our business operations and strategy further customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data despite security measures and business continuity plans these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers computer viruses malware including “ransomware” phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to these systems and products the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides therein similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products such events could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition such events could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies we have experienced such events in the past and although past events were immaterial future events may occur and may be material 

portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design manufacture and sell products and services and interrupt other business processes 

security breaches and other disruptions of our invehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products  our vehicles contain complex information technology systems these systems control various vehicle functions including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock functions we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their system could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our enterprise data practices including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers employees or suppliers are subject to increasingly complex restrictive and punitive regulations in all key market regions  under these regulations the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties as well as brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services because many of these laws are new there is little clarity as to their interpretation as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future for example in europe the general data protection regulation came into effect on may 25 2018 and applies to all of our ongoing operations in the eu as well as some of our operations outside of the eu that involve the processing of eu personal data this regulation significantly increases the potential financial penalties for noncompliance including fines of up to 4 of worldwide revenue similar regulations are coming into effect in brazil and china and in the us california has adopted and several states and provinces in canada are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding personal data in some cases these laws provide a private right of action that would allow customers to bring suit directly against us for mishandling their data 

our operations and products are subject to extensive laws regulations and policies including those related to vehicle emissions fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio particularly regulations relating to emissions fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging especially because the standards are not harmonized across jurisdictions we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations laws and policies and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily out of concern for the environment including concerns about global climate change and its impact these government regulatory requirements among others could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue refer to the “environmental and regulatory matters” section of item 1 business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements 

we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased costs there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame however primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technologies and the human engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of safety fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

in addition many of our advanced technologies including autonomous vehicles present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty 

we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits class action litigations alleging product defects emissions litigation both in the us and elsewhere stockholder litigation labor and employment litigation in various countries including us canada korea and brazil claims and actions arising from divestitures of operations and assets and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines significant reputational harm civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs in addition we may become obligated to issue additional shares adjustment shares of up to 30 million shares of our common stock subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends stock splits and other transactions to the motors liquidation company mlc guc trust guc trust under a provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and general motors corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust as estimated by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york bankruptcy court exceed 350 billion the guc trust stated in public filings that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately 321 billion as of september 30 2019 for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform concerns about the safety of our products including advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delays recalls lost sales governmental investigations regulatory action private claims lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities which may not agree with our tax positions in addition our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties including those arising from potential changes in laws andor regulations in the countries in which we do business the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers in north america south america and asiapacific gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency availability and cost of sources of financing including credit facilities securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by chargeoffs delinquencies and prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies competition for customers from commercial banks credit unions and other financing and leasing companies and changes to regulation supervision enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions 

in addition a substantial portion of gm financial’s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates primarily based on usdlibor the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance modification or other reforms may have on libor other benchmarks or floating–rate debt instruments including gm financial’s floating–rate debt any such discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on gm financial’s current or future indebtedness there is a risk that the discontinuation of libor will impact gm financials ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement 

further as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

factors that affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes forwardlooking statements in this mda are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forwardlooking statements section of this mda and item 1a risk factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 is incorporated by reference into this mda 

nongaap measures unless otherwise indicated our nongaap measures discussed in this mda are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations our nongaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted presented net of noncontrolling interests earnings before income taxes ebtadjusted for our gm financial segment earnings per share epsdilutedadjusted effective tax rateadjusted etradjusted return on invested capitaladjusted roicadjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures 

these nongaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance furthermore these nongaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

decisions being made by management to improve roicadjusted management uses these measures in its financial investment and operational decisionmaking processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes further our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performancebased compensation plans for these reasons we believe these nongaap measures are useful for our investors 

ebitadjusted ebitadjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on longlived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies for ebitadjusted and our other nongaap measures once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item we will also adjust the related nongaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebtadjusted 

epsdilutedadjusted epsdilutedadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis epsdilutedadjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less income loss from discontinued operations on an aftertax basis adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weightedaverage common shares outstandingdiluted examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances 

etradjusted etradjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis etradjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for epsdilutedadjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the us gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict 

roicadjusted roicadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions we define roicadjusted as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roicadjusted average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities exclusive of finance leases average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits opeb liabilities and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale 

adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebitadjusted purposes refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda for additional information

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the worlds most valued automotive company our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility and advance our vision of zero crashes zero emissions zero congestion while also strengthening the core of our business earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience leading in technology and innovation including electrification autonomous vehicles and data connectivity growing our brands making tough strategic decisions about the markets and products in which we will invest and compete building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10 core margins on an ebitadjusted basis 

our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw which was ratified in november 2015 expired on september 14 2019 the uaw went on strike on september 16 2019 causing subsequent stoppages to most vehicle production and parts distribution across our north america facilities on october 25 2019 the uaw ratified a new collectively bargained labor agreement labor agreement the labor agreement which has a term of four years covers the wages hours benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our uawrepresented employees the key terms and provisions of the labor agreement are

the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities certified preowned extended warranty and free maintenance of 86 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of 08 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

potentially associated with these amounts in addition future cash outflows related to transformation activities announced in november 2018 are not included in the table above refer to note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models 

we accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable which is generally at the time of sale 

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 03 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time incentive programs are generally specific to brand model or sales region and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from two to five years at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on thirdparty data that considers various data points and assumptions including but not limited to recent auction values the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles used vehicle prices manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands 



at december 31 2019  the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was 304 billion we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straightline basis the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2019  which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make year and model into leased asset groups check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2019 2018 or 2017 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2019 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 64 at december 31 2018 to 59 at december 31 2019  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment

the society of actuaries soa issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31 2019  we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31 2019 us pension and opeb plans obligations 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 67 billion and 47 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  the yearoveryear change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns at december 31 2019  30 billion of the unamortized pretax actuarial loss is outside the corridor primarily 10 of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weightedaverage amortization period for the pension obligation is approximately 16 years resulting in amortization expense of 02 billion in 2020  

the underfunded status of the us pension plans increased by 04 billion in the year ended december 31 2019 to 54 billion primarily due to 1 the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of 64 billion  and 2 service and interest costs of 24 billion  partially offset by 3 a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 85 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

automotive the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting longshort positions in currency or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2019 our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the us dollar and the canadian dollar korean won euro brazilian real australian dollar mexican peso and chinese yuan derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2019  

  

the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 14 billion and 09 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 02 billion and 01 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of 51 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2019 and 2018  the fair value liability of debt and finance leases was 159 billion and 135 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 06 billion and 08 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  

we had marketable debt securities of 42 billion and 60 billion classified as availableforsale at december 31 2019 and 2018  the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2019 and 2018  

equity price risk we are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility related to our investment in lyft and psa warrants the fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was 15 billion at december 31 2019  in march 2019 lyft filed for an initial public offering which significantly increased the volatility in the fair value of our investment in lyft our investment in lyft is valued based on the quoted market price and our investment in psa warrants is valued based on a blackscholes formula we estimate that a 10 adverse change in quoted security prices in lyft and psa group would impact our investments by 01 billion

interest rate risk fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt gm financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance these differences may include tenor yield repricing timing and prepayment expectations typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by gm financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial earn variable interest gm financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging

quantitative disclosure gm financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below these interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements 

at december 31 2019 gm financial was liabilitysensitive meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets which would initially decrease net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially increase at december 31 2018 gm financial was assetsensitive meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on debt which would initially increase net interest income during a period of falling interest rates net interest income would be expected to initially decrease 

gm financials net interest income sensitivity continued to decrease in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to gm financials strategy of hedging fixedrate asset originations with payfixed interest rate swaps the following table presents gm financials net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement 



 

 

additional model assumptions the sensitivity analysis presented is gm financials best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios however actual results could differ the estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio originations of finance receivables and leases refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives the prepayment projections are based on historical experience if interest rates or other factors change actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of 62 billion and 39 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant at december 31 2019 and 2018

automotive our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments gm north america gmna and gm international gmi gmna meets the demands of customers in north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet and gmc brands gmi primarily meets the demands of customers outside north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet gmc and holden brands we also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries primarily in china with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the baojun buick cadillac chevrolet jiefang and wuling brands 

in addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers including daily rental car companies commercial fleet customers leasing companies and governments our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network such as maintenance light repairs collision repairs vehicle accessories and extended service warranties 

competitive position and vehicle sales the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design price quality available options safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

we present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share  wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to gms dealers and distributors as well as sales to the us government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to  our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles which is the largest component of automotive net sales and revenue  in the year ended december 31 2018 36 of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the us the following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment vehicles in thousands   



   

 

total vehicle sales data represents 1 retail sales ie sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors 2 fleet sales such as sales to large and small businesses governments and daily rental car companies and 3 vehicles used by dealers in their businesses including courtesy transportation vehicles total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for china while total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue  we

recognize during a particular period we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for  our vehicles total vehicle sales data represents managements good faith estimate based on sales reported by gms dealers distributors and joint ventures commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available 

 the following table summarizes total industry vehicle sales  and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

general motors company and subsidiaries 

as discussed above total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles certain fleet transactions particularly sales to daily rental car companies are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers prior to january 1 2018 a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies were recorded as operating leases under us gaap with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations beginning january 1 2018 a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products 

cyclical nature of business retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends in part on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers we market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters

autonomous technology we see autonomous technology leading to a future of zero crashes zero emissions and zero congestion since more than 90 of crashes are caused by driver error according to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa we are among the leaders in the industry with significant global realworld experience in delivering connectivity and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology an example of advanced technology is super cruise a driver assistance feature that enables handsfree driving on the highway which will be expanded to all cadillac models with rollout beginning in 2020 

we are actively testing autonomous vehicles in san francisco california scottsdale arizona and michigan gated by safety and regulation we continue to make rapid progress toward commercialization of a network of ondemand autonomous vehicles in the us 

in january 2018 we revealed the cruise av a productionintent selfdriving vehicle that was engineered from the start to operate safely on its own with no driver 

in may 2018 softbank vision fund the vision fund agreed to invest in gm cruise our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology in addition in october 2018 we reached an agreement to work jointly with honda motor co ltd honda to fund and develop a shared autonomous vehicle sav for gm cruise that can serve a wide variety of use cases and be manufactured at high volume for additional information on thirdparty investments in gm cruise refer to the overview section of the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda 

alternative fuel vehicles we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting ghg emissions in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on ethanolgasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we offer a variety of flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2019  model year to retail and fleet customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two in brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold are flexfuel vehicles capable

of running on high ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels are in the marketplace we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources 

hydrogen fuel cell technology another part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than three million miles of realworld driving these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology we are exploring nontraditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas including demonstrations with the us army and us navy 

we signed a codevelopment agreement and established a nonconsolidated jv with honda in 2016 for a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for commercialization in the early 2020s we expect the collaboration to succeed by sharing expertise economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and building upon gms and hondas strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology

intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole these patents are important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements we continue to experience higher commodity costs and anticipate higher costs associated with tariffs 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have been approximately 12 of our total purchases in each of the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system and other inuse compliance monitoring activities may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirements have become more stringent as a result of lower emission standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world driven by policy priorities such as air quality energy security and climate change often with very little harmonization while we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers this includes vehicle emissions testing including co 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing and review of emission control designs and strategies 

the us federal government through the environmental protection agency epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us the california air resources board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards as well as the requirement that increasing percentages of zero emission vehicle zevs must be sold in california the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt california emission standards in lieu of federal requirements thirteen states have adopted california emission standards and ten 

 5 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

of these have adopted the zev requirements there is a possibility that additional us jurisdictions could adopt california emissions and zev requirements in the future 

although the epa has not imposed zev requirements the epa and californias emissions control standards will likely increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance the canadian federal governments vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the us federal requirements the canadian province of quebec has adopted zev requirements starting with the 2018 model year largely based on california program requirements 

 each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavyduty engines will meet emission requirements of the epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and of the carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

china implemented the china 5 emission standard nationwide at the beginning of 2017 china 5 is more stringent than the previous program on all levels including overall emission requirements and the time and mileage period for which vehicles need to meet china 5 level performance china will implement a unique china 6 emission standard that combines elements of both european and us standards and includes more stringent emission requirements and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance nationwide implementation for new registrations is expected in july 2020 for china 6a and july 2023 for the more stringent china 6b standard localities can pull ahead china 6 requirements if certain criteria are met the majority of cities that have announced plans to implement china 6 early have projected implementation in july 2019 but one city has indicated implementation in the three months ended march 31 2019 for additional information refer to item 1a risk factors 

in south america certain countries follow the us test procedures standards and obd requirements and others follow the european union test procedures standards and obd requirements with different levels of stringency brazil implemented national l6 standards for light diesel vehicles in 2012 and obd installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015 l6 standards for light gasoline vehicles were implemented in 2015 for all models 

as a result of the sale of the opelvauxhall business gm’s vehicle presence in europe is smaller but gm may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to opelvauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the opelvauxhall business as well as to other vehicles gm continues to sell in europe in the european union increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards including implementation of “real world driving” emissions tests as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement for example our former german subsidiary has participated in continuing discussions with german and european authorities concerning emissions control systems for additional information refer to note 22  to our consolidated financial statements 

automotive fuel economy    in the   us the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years including credits obtained from other manufacturers in addition to federal cafe the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standards which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle ghg emissions are carbon dioxide emissions that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel burned by a vehicle the epa and nhtsa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emissions of medium and heavyduty vehicles imposing more stringent standards over time 

in canada lightduty and heavyduty ghg regulations are currently patterned after the existing epa ghg emission standards however with both the us and canadian governments reviewing potential changes to these existing regulations and the difference in each countrys climate change policies there is an increased risk that future canadian lightduty ghg regulations may not be aligned with future epa regulations in addition carb has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards for motor vehicles and other states have asserted the right to adopt the california standards until recently carb regulations have provided that compliance with the federal epa lightduty ghg program is deemed to be in compliance with the california standards through the 2025 model year however on december 12 2018 carb amended this regulation to clarify that in the event the epa alters the ghg stringency by means of the nowpending epa ghg rulemaking compliance with the epas ghg emissions standards will no longer be deemed in compliance with carbs requirements as a result depending on the outcome of the epa ghg rulemaking and finality of carbs regulatory amendment in the future gm might be required to meet california standards that are different than the epa ghg standards

china has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement with a focus on the fleet average program the current china phase 4 fleet fuel consumption requirement which went into effect in 2016 is based on curb weight with full compliance to 50l100 km required by 2020 china phase 4 has continued subsidies for plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china phase 5 is currently being developed with a planned start in 2021 with full compliance to 40l100km required by 2025 in addition china has established the new energy vehicle nev mandate which will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to generate credits equivalent to 10 in 2019 and 12 in 2020 against the internal combustion engine vehicle production volume the number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency the nev mandate requirement for 2021 to 2025 currently is being developed with a goal of nev volume reaching 20 of total vehicle volume in 2025 

regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations if regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce emission standards that are misaligned with market conditions we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for more fuelefficient vehicles and curtail production of certain highperformance cars trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulations 

industrial environmental control    our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment we are converting as many of our worldwide operations as practicable to landfillfree operations which reduces ghg emissions associated with waste disposal at december 31 2018  75 or approximately 50 of our manufacturing operations and 61 of our nonmanufacturing operations were landfillfree including idled facilities at our landfillfree manufacturing operations approximately 94 of waste materials are composted reused or recycled and approximately 5 are converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities in 2018 we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 16 million metric tons of waste from landfill resulting in approximately 69 million metric tons of ghg emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations including construction demolition and remediation wastes 

in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of material reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we are committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by 2050 at december 31 2018  we had implemented projects or signed renewable energy contracts globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 400 megawatts which represents approximately 20 of our global electricity use in 2018 several wind farms totaling approximately 250 megawatts now match the load of gm facilities in texas ohio and indiana we continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in 2018 energy star certified one assembly plant in canada through natural resources canada and 17 buildings in the us for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at eight additional sites globally   by reducing energy intensity an average of 13 at these sites within 25 years to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 within a five year period in total 75 gmowned manufacturing sites have met the epa challenge with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 137 recognitions these efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a ghg emissions reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan to operate more efficiently and publicly reporting progress against our target 

  chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

globally governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaties and initiatives such as the stockholm basel and rotterdam 

 7 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

conventions on chemicals and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries in addition more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to vehicle interior air quality 

chemical regulations are increasing in north america in  the us the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act and several us states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design such as the california and washington laws banning the use of copper in brake friction material chemical restrictions in canada continue to progress rapidly as a result of environment canadas chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic 

china prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles there are also various regulations in china stipulating the requirements for chemical management among other things these regulations catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substances the failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the china market 

these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates 

safety    in the us the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the us that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by nhtsa if we or nhtsa determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures adding complexity to regulatory compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

we have listed below the most significant risk factors applicable to us these risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry our business could suffer  we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies products services and methods of travel and vehicle ownership it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous vehicles in a rideshare environment to successfully execute our longterm strategy we must continue to develop new products and services including products and services that are outside of our historically core business such as autonomous and electric vehicles digital services and transportation as a service the process of designing and developing new technology products and services is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models preserving our reputation for designing building and selling safe highquality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions and changes in quality safety reliability and styling demands and preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our profitability is dependent upon the success of suvs and fullsize pickup trucks while we offer a balanced portfolio of cars crossovers suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our suvs and trucks our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles 

we may continue to restructure our operations in the us and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions but we may not succeed in doing so  since 2017 we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world including the us korea and europe as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations which may result in asset writedowns or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs for example in late 2018 we announced certain transformation actions to drive significant cost efficiencies and realign our current

manufacturing capacity and utilization in response to marketrelated volume declines in passenger cars there is no guarantee that we will realize the anticipated savings or benefits from past or future restructuring andor cost reduction actions in full or within the time periods we expect in addition these actions also subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes litigation negative publicity and business disruption failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring andor cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our electric vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles as well as increased consumer adoption we anticipate that the production and profitable sale of electric vehicles will become increasingly important to our business our inability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of batteryelectric vehicles may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development of electric vehicles the benefits from these incentives could be reduced eliminated or exhausted which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicles at high enough prices to be profitable in addition our sale of electric vehicles is dependent upon consumer adoption which could be impacted by numerous factors including perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of fuel government regulations and economic incentives and access to charging facilities 

our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks in recent years we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies including in gm cruise holdings llc gm cruise holdings our subsidiary that is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including our ability to continue to develop selfdriving software and hardware such as lidar sensors and other components access to sufficient capital including with respect to additional softbank funding that is subject to regulatory approval risks related to the manufacture of purposebuilt autonomous vehicles and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny and further regulation any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values the availability and prices of used vehicles levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic conditions for a discussion of economic and market trends see the overview section of the mda we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty

our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational competitive and regulatory risks   maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as nontraditional market participants such as domestic technology companies in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to infotainment and other new technologies increased competition increased uschina trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in china among other things may result in price reductions reduced sales profitability and margins and challenges to gain or hold market share in addition to increased competition chinese regulators have announced aggressive green policy initiatives and quotas for the sale of electric vehicles which have challenging lead times 

certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market at times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability in particular the announced intention of several chinese cities to implement new china 6 emissions regulations in july 2019 represents a risk for the sales of our chinese joint ventures 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit many of our operations primarily in china and korea are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners interests in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties fines or other related actions for these activities 

the international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and a variety of other political economic and regulatory risks including 1 changes in government leadership 2 changes in labor tax and other laws regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives 3 political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials services components systems and parts or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives 4 political instability or government controls over certain sectors 5 political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends especially between china and the us 6 more detailed inspections new or higher tariffs for example on products imported into or exported from the us 7 new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements including changes to withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements for example the north american free trade agreement or its successor or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products 8 changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly in brazil and argentina and interest rates 9 economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate 10 differing local product preferences and product requirements including government certification requirements related to among other things fuel economy vehicle emissions and safety 11 impact of compliance with us and other foreign countries’ export controls and economic sanctions 12 liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws 13 differing labor regulations requirements and union relationships 14 differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships and 15 difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations

any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products systems components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions or catastrophic weather events the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment 

in 2019 our collective bargaining agreement with the united automobile workers will expire and we will negotiate a new agreement in addition in late 2018 we announced certain restructuring actions which included among other things a reduction in our workforce and the unallocation of products to certain manufacturing facilities in north america as a result we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees 

any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions any number of factors including labor disruptions catastrophic weather events contractual or other disputes with suppliers and supplier financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including the production of certain of our higher margin vehicles if we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely 

high prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability increases in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products systems components and parts such as steel precious metals or nonferrous metals including aluminum copper and plastic may lead to higher production costs for parts components and vehicles changes in trade policies and tariffs fluctuations in supply and demand and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs many of our competitors have responded to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices as a result we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives commodity or other cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness 

domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a lowcost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours and there are no guarantees that gms intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services there may be instances where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such efforts will

completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of enforcement of patents by third parties including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks if we are found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services 

security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products including connected vehicles owned or maintained by us gm financial or thirdparty vendors or suppliers on our behalf could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes activities and products additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these systems and products and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers computer viruses or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to these systems and products the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and products similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products such events could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies we have experienced such events in the past and although past events were immaterial future events may occur and may be material 

portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design manufacture and sell products and services and interrupt other business processes 

security breaches and other disruptions of our invehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products  our vehicles contain complex information technology systems these systems control various vehicle functions including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock functions we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our enterprise data practices including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers employees or suppliers are subject to increasingly complex restrictive and punitive regulations in all key market regions  under these regulations the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties as well as brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services because many of these laws are new there is little clarity as to their interpretation as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future for example in europe the general data protection regulation came into effect on may 25 2018 and applies to all our ongoing operations in the eu this regulation significantly increases the potential financial penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover similar regulations are coming into effect in brazil china and california

our operations and products are subject to extensive laws governmental regulations and policies that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio particularly regulations relating to emissions and fuel economy standards meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging especially when standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations laws and policies and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily out of concern for the environment including concerns about global climate change and its impact these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matters section of item 1 business for further information on these requirements we also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally 

we expect that to comply with current or even revised fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame however there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of safety fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

many of our advanced technologies including autonomous vehicles present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty 

we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits class action litigations alleging product defects emissions litigation both in the us and elsewhere stockholder litigation labor litigation in various countries including korea and brazil and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines significant reputational harm civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs in addition we may become obligated to issue additional shares adjustment shares of up to 30 million shares of our common stock subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends stock splits and other transactions to the motors liquidation company mlc guc trust guc trust under a provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and general motors corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust as estimated by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york bankruptcy court exceed 350 billion the guc trust stated in public filings that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately 319 billion  as of december 31 2018 for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform concerns about the safety of our products including advanced technologies like autonomous whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delays recalls lost sales governmental investigations regulatory action private claims lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry

we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities which may not agree with our tax positions in addition our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties including those arising from potential changes in laws andor regulations in the countries in which we do business the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate for example the impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017 may differ from the company’s previously recorded amounts possibly materially due to potential changes in the tax act including with respect to the regulations promulgated thereunder or changes to its interpretation if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers in north america south america and asiapacific gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations which in turn impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency availability and cost of sources of financing including credit facilities securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by chargeoffs delinquencies and prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies and changes to regulation supervision enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions 

further as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

our future funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

 16 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes forwardlooking statements in this mda are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forwardlooking statements section of this mda and item 1a risk factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties 

nongaap measures unless otherwise indicated our nongaap measures  discussed in this mda  are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations  our nongaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted presented net of noncontrolling interests core ebitadjusted earnings per share epsdilutedadjusted effective tax rateadjusted etradjusted return on invested capitaladjusted roicadjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures   

these nongaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance furthermore these nongaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roicadjusted management uses these measures in its financial investment and operational decisionmaking processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes further our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performancebased compensation plans for these reasons we believe these nongaap measures are useful for our investors   

ebitadjusted ebitadjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on longlived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies for ebitadjusted and our other nongaap measures once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item we will also adjust the related nongaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item   

core ebitadjusted   core ebitadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our core consolidated operating results core ebitadjusted begins with ebitadjusted and excludes the ebitadjusted results of gm cruise prior to the three months ended june 30 2018 core ebitadjusted excluded the ebitadjusted results of autonomous vehicle operations including gm cruise maven and our investment in lyft inc lyft the measure was changed to align with segment reporting all periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes   

epsdilutedadjusted epsdilutedadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis epsdilutedadjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less income loss from discontinued operations on an aftertax basis adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weightedaverage common shares outstandingdiluted examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances   

etradjusted etradjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis etradjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for epsdilutedadjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments   

roicadjusted   roicadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions we define roicadjusted as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roicadjusted average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities exclusive of capital leases average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits opeb liabilities and average

automotive net income tax assets during the same period adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale   

adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebitadjusted purposes  refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda for additional information

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the worlds most valued automotive company our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes zero emissions zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience leading in technology and innovation including electrification autonomous data connectivity growing our brands making tough strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10 core margins on an ebitadjusted basis 

in addition to our ebitadjusted margin improvement goal through 2018 we fully realized our financial targets of 65 billion in total annual operational and functional cost savings compared to 2014 costs 

for the year ending december 31 2019  we expect epsdiluted of between 517 and 600 and epsdilutedadjusted of between 650 and 700 the following table reconciles expected epsdiluted under us gaap to expected epsdilutedadjusted and includes the future impact of the expected adjustment related to transformation activities 



 

 

we face continuing market operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to among other factors weak economic conditions competitive pressures our product portfolio offerings heightened emissions standards foreign exchange volatility rising materials prices trade policy and political uncertainty as a result of these conditions we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point refer to item 1a risk factors for a discussion of these challenges we expect transformation activities to drive approximately 60 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020 resulting from reductions in automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements as well as reduced capital expenditures this target includes approximately 45 billion of cost savings to be achieved through staffing manufacturing and product initiatives as we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required these additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations

the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries investigations subpoenas requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of us federal state and canadian governments in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages fines civil consent orders civil and criminal penalties or other remedies refer to note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

takata matters   in may 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phasedstabilized ammonium nitratebased propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multiyear riskbased schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time temperature cycling and environmental moisture 

although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicles within scope of the takata dirs in cooperation with nhtsa we have filed preliminary dirs covering certain of our gmt900 vehicles which are fullsize pickup trucks and suvs we have also filed petitions for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to those preliminary dirs nhtsa has consolidated our petitions and will rule on them at the same time 

while these petitions have been pending we have provided nhtsa with the results of our longterm studies and the studies performed by thirdparty experts all of which form the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required 

we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and our inflator aging studies and field data support the belief that the vehicles unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk for example the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles and include features such as greater venting unique propellant wafer configurations and machined steel end caps the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass 

accordingly no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the us we estimate a reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately 12 billion 

gm has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the us to replace takata inflators in those vehicles there are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the us we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators additional recalls if any could be material to our results of operations and cash flows we continue to monitor the international situation

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall campaigns the number of vehicles per recall campaign the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 02 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time incentive programs are generally specific to brand model or sales region and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms which typically range from two to five years at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on thirdparty data which considers inputs including recent auction values the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles used vehicle prices manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices realization of the

general motors company and subsidiaries 

residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle prior to or at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands 



at december 31 2018  the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was 314 billion we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straightline basis the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2018  which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio holding all other assumptions constant 



we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make year and model into leased asset groups check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards a leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicators exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flows including the expected residual value are lower than the carrying value of the asset group we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2018 2017 or 2016 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2018  an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 66  at december 31 2017  to 64  at december 31 2018  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount 

 39 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment 

the society of actuaries soa issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31 2018  we reviewed our recent mortality experience and have updated our base mortality assumptions in the us this change in assumption decreased the december 31 2018 us pension and opeb plans obligations by 03 billion we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31 2018  us pension and opeb plans obligations 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 47 billion  and 40 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  the yearoveryear change is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns partially offset by the increase in discount rates at december 31 2018   21 billion  of the unamortized pretax actuarial loss is outside the corridor primarily 10 of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weightedaverage amortization period is approximately sixteen years resulting in amortization expense of 01 billion  in 2019  

the underfunded status of the us pension plans decreased by 07 billion  in the year ended december 31 2018  to 51 billion  due primarily to 1 a favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of 41 billion  and 2 other favorable changes including contributions demographic gains and assumption changes of 03 billion  partially offset by 3 service and interest cost of 23 billion and 4 an unfavorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 14 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

automotive the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect 

 41 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures offsetting longshort positions in currency or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2018  our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the us dollar and the canadian dollar brazilian real euro chinese yuan australian dollar mexican peso and argentine peso derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2018  

  

the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 09 billion  and 08 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 01 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of 27 billion  and 40 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 135 billion  and 151 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 08 billion  and 07 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  

we had marketable securities of 60 billion  and 83 billion  classified as availableforsale at december 31 2018  and 2017  the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2018  and 2017  

automotive financing  gm financial 

interest rate risk   fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt typically retail finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial may be pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

 42 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

quantitative disclosure  we measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below these interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements 

under these interest rate scenarios we are assetsensitive meaning that we expect more assets than liabilities to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest earned on our assets will increase more than the interest paid on our debt which would initially increase our net interest income during a period of falling interest rates we would expect our net interest income to initially decrease the following table presents our net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement 



 

 

additional model assumptions   the sensitivity analysis presented is our best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios however our actual results could differ our estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio originations of finance receivables and leases refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives our prepayment projections are based on historical experience if interest rates or other factors change our actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of 39 billion and  28 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

 item 1 business 

general motors company sometimes referred to as we our us ourselves the company general motors or gm was incorporated as a delaware corporation in 2009 we design build and sell cars trucks crossovers and automobile parts worldwide we also provide automotive financing services through general motors financial company inc gm financial except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified amounts presented within tables are stated in millions 

on july 31 2017 we closed the sale of the opel and vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in europe the opelvauxhall business to peugeot sa psa group on october 31 2017 we closed the sale of the european financing subsidiaries and branches the fincos and together with the opelvauxhall business the european business to banque psa finance sa and bnp paribas personal finance sa the european business was previously reported as our gm europe gme segment and part of gm financial the european business is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the european business are presented as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016  unless otherwise indicated information in this report relates to our continuing operations 

segment reporting data during the three months ended december 31 2017  we changed our automotive segments as a result of changes in our organizational structure and the evolution of our business resulting from the sale of the opelvauxhall business and the various strategic actions taken in the gm international operations gmio region as a result our gm south america gmsa and gmio operating segments are now reported as one combined reportable international segment gm international gmi our gm north america gmna and gm financial segments were not impacted all periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes operating segment data and principal geographic area data for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are summarized in note 24  to our consolidated financial statements 

automotive our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments gmna and gmi gmna meets the demands of customers in north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet and gmc brands gmi primarily meets the demands of customers outside north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet gmc and holden brands we also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries primarily in china with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the baojun buick cadillac chevrolet jiefang and wuling brands 

in addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers including daily rental car companies commercial fleet customers leasing companies and governments our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network such as maintenance light repairs collision repairs vehicle accessories and extended service warranties 

competitive position and vehicle sales the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design price quality available options safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

we present both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share   wholesale vehicle sales data which represents sales directly to dealers and others including sales to fleet customers is the measure that correlates to  our revenue from the sale of vehicles which is the largest component of automotive net sales and revenue wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles sold by joint ventures  in the year ended december 31 2017 39 of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the us the following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment vehicles in thousands

retail vehicle sales data which represents sales to end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management including sales to fleet customers does not correlate directly to the revenue  we recognize during the period however retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for  our vehicles market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume in countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available other data sources such as wholesale or forecast volumes are used to estimate retail vehicle sales to end customers   

retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles used by dealers under courtesy transportation programs and vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel primarily in europe this sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator loaner and selfregistered vehicles which are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies the following table summarizes total industry retail sales or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available  of vehicles and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

in the year ended december 31 2017  we estimate we had the largest market share in north america and south america and the number three market share in the asiapacific middle east and africa region which included the number two market share in china refer to the overview in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda for discussion on changes in market share by region 

the sales and market share data provided in the table above includes both fleet vehicle sales and sales to retail customers certain fleet transactions particularly sales to daily rental car companies are generally less profitable than sales to retail customers a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under us gaap with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



the following table summarizes united states fleet sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products 

cyclical nature of business retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends in part on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers we market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



 3 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product and business development and intellectual property costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas ghg emissions control improved fuel economy electrification autonomous vehicles the safety of drivers and passengers and urban mobility research and development expenses were 73 billion  66 billion  and 60 billion  in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

product development the product development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and powertrain components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments global teams in design program management component  subsystem engineering product integrity safety propulsion systems and purchasing  supply chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale 

our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our global technical center in warren michigan crosssegment part sharing is an essential enabler to our vehicle set strategy designed to reduce our overall number of global vehicle architectures to four major vehicle sets as we implement the four vehicle sets we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles we are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eassist plugin hybrid full hybrid extended range and zero emission battery electric vehicles that are part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions we currently offer seven models in the us featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and bolt ev in october 2017 we announced our plans to launch more than 20 new zero emission vehicles zevs in global markets by 2023 including two in the next 18 months 

car and ridesharing our carsharing brand maven gives customers access to highly personalized ondemand mobility services maven is available in 18 cities across the us and canada and has started first pilot operations in australia maven offers three different types of consumer and commercial services maven gig allows members to earn money on their own terms by providing a vehicle that can be used to deliver goods or ridesharing services provided by lyft inc lyft and uber technologies inc maven city offers vehicles with dedicated parking spots for easy city driving with the cost of gas or electric charging included vehicles are available by the hour day week or month maven home provides onsite car sharing for residential communities through december 31 2017  maven has accumulated over 230 million miles driven 5 million allelectric miles driven 114000 reservations and has 104000 members 

autonomous technology we see autonomous technology leading to a future of zero congestion zero emissions and zero crashes since more than 90 of crashes are caused by driver error according to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa we are among the leaders in the industry with significant global realworld experience in delivering connectivity safety and security services to millions of customers through onstar llc onstar and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology an example of advanced automation is super cruise a handsfree driving customer convenience feature that is available on the 2018 cadillac ct6 sedan 

we are actively testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in san francisco california scottsdale arizona and warren michigan additionally we plan to develop an integrated network of ondemand autonomous vehicles in the us in november

general motors company and subsidiaries 

2017 we announced that our growing fleet of test vehicles will accumulate a significant number of miles in 2018 and based on our current rate of change we expect commercial launch at scale in dense urban environments in 2019 

alternative fuel vehicles we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting ghg emissions in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on ethanolgasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas 

we offer a variety of flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2018  model year to retail and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two in brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold are flexfuel vehicles capable of running on high ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels are in the marketplace we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources 

hydrogen fuel cell technology another part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and ghg emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than 3 million miles of realworld driving these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology we are exploring nontraditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas including demonstrations with the us army and us navy 

we signed a codevelopment agreement and established a nonconsolidated jv with honda motor company in 2016 for a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for the 2020 timeframe for commercialization the collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon gms and honda motor companys strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology 

onstar onstar is a whollyowned subsidiary of gm serving more than 7 million subscribers onstar is a provider of connected safety security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2018  model year vehicles onstars key services include automatic crash response stolen vehicle assistance remote door unlock turnbyturn navigation vehicle diagnostics handsfree calling and 4g lte wireless connectivity 

intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole these patents are important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have been approximately 12 of our total purchases in each of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system and other inuse compliance monitoring activities may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirements have become more stringent as a result of lower emission standards and new diagnostic requirements which have come into force in many markets around the world driven by policy priorities such as air quality energy security and climate change often with very little harmonization of the regulations while we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured 

 5 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers this includes vehicle emissions testing including co 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing and review of emission control designs and strategies 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and various state governments impose additional emission requirements established by california canada’s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the us federal requirements each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the us environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

carbs latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in zevs which must be offered for sale in california carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve ghg as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm ghg reduction goals the canadian province of quebec also plans to adopt zev requirements starting with the 2018 model year largely based on california program requirements there is a possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt zev requirements in the future the epa has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which began a multiyear phasein with the 2017 model year but do not include zev requirements these new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the zev requirements 

china implemented the china 5 emission standard nationwide at the beginning of 2017 china 5 is more stringent than the previous program on all levels including overall emission requirements and the time and mileage period for which vehicles need to meet china 5 level performance china will implement a unique china 6 emission standard that combines elements of both european and us standards includes more stringent emission requirements and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance nationwide implementation for new registrations is expected in july 2020 for china 6a and july 2023 for the more stringent china 6b standard however localities can pull ahead china 6 requirements if certain criteria are met some cities may implement china 6 as early as january 2019 

in south america certain countries follow the us test procedures standards and obd requirements and others follow the   european union test procedures standards and obd requirements with different levels of stringency brazil implemented national l6 standards for light diesel vehicles in 2012 and obd installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015 l6 standards for light gasoline vehicles were implemented in 2015 for all models 

as a result of the sale of the opelvauxhall business gm’s vehicle presence in europe will be smaller but gm may be affected by actions taken by regulators related to products sold before the sale of the opelvauxhall business and future products sold by gm in europe for example in germany a number of automotive manufacturers including our former german subsidiary have participated in continuing discussions with german and european union authorities concerning emissions control systems in the european union increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards including implementation of “real world driving” emissions rde tests as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased costs penalties and lack of certainty related to product portfolio planning negative publicity or reputation impact for us in the longterm we expect that the european commission will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle rde low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd 

automotive fuel economy    in the   us nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years in addition to federal cafe reporting the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standards which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle ghg emissions are the result of fuel combustion in addition carb has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state ghg standards for motor vehicles and other states have asserted the right to adopt the california standards however carb has agreed that compliance with the federal epa light duty ghg program is deemed to be in compliance with the california standards through the 2025 model year

china has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement the current china phase 4 fleet fuel consumption requirement is effective from 20162020 china phase 4 is based on curb weight with full compliance to 50l100 km required by 2020 china phase 4 has continued subsidies for plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china phase 5 is currently being developed with a planned start in 2021 with full compliance to 40l100km required by 2025 china recently announced the details of the new energy vehicle mandate this will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cells vehicles to generate credits equivalent to 10 in 2019 and 12 in 2020 the number of credits per car is based on the level of erange and energy efficiency 

regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations if regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce emission standards that are misaligned with market conditions we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for more fuelefficient vehicles and curtail production of certain highperformance cars trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulations 

industrial environmental control    our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment we are converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfillfree operations which reduces ghg emissions associated with waste disposal at december 31 2017  80 or approximately 50 of our manufacturing operations were landfillfree additionally 63 of our nonmanufacturing operations are landfillfree at our landfillfree manufacturing operations approximately 95 of waste materials are composted reused or recycled and approximately 4 are converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities in 2017 we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 15 million metric tons of waste from landfill resulting in approximately 66 million metric tons of ghg emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations including construction demolition and remediation wastes 

in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of material reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency and work to drive   growth and scale of renewables we have committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable   energy by 2050 at december 31 2017  we had implemented projects or signed renewable energy contracts globally that had   increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 400 megawatts in 2017 gm executed two 100 megawatt wind power   purchase agreements to match our ohio and indiana manufacturing plant load when each of these projects come online in 2018 we continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in 2017 energy star certified three of our assembly plants and 17 buildings for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at eight additional sites globally   by reducing energy intensity an average of 18 at these sites to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 within a five year period in total 71 gmowned sites have met the epa challenge with many sites achieving the goal multiple times these efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a ghg emissions reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target 

  chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

globally governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaties and initiatives such as the stockholm basel and rotterdam conventions on chemicals and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries in addition more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to vehicle interior air quality

chemical regulations are increasing in north america in  june 2016 the us enacted the chemical safety for the 21 st century act  that grants the epa increased authority to regulate and restrict chemical use in the us and is expected to increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles chemical restrictions in canada continue to progress rapidly as a result of environment canadas chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic 

china prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles there are also various regulations in china stipulating the requirements for chemical management among other things these regulations catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substances the failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the china market 

these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates 

safety    in the us the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the us that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the nhtsa if we or nhtsa determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures adding complexity to regulatory compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

we have listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence the most significant risk factors applicable to us 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry our business could suffer  we believe that the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry industry participants are seeking to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies new products or services new business models or new methods of travel it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry to successfully execute our longterm strategy we must continue to develop new products and services including products and services that are outside of our historically core business such as autonomous and electric vehicles data monetization and transportation as a service the process of designing and developing new technology products and services is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing building and selling safe high quality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability 

it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions and changes in quality safety reliability and styling demands and preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our profitability is dependent upon the success of crossovers suvs and fullsize pickup trucks while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small midsize and large cars crossovers suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our crossovers suvs and trucks our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles 

we must successfully address and reduce the costs associated with the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles we anticipate that electric vehicle sales will become increasingly important to our business the inability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition in addition we currently 

 10 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles the benefits from these incentives could be reduced eliminated or exhausted which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicles in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic conditions for discussion of economic and market trends see the overview section of item 7 we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty 

our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational competitive and regulatory risks   maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and challenges to gain or hold market share 

in addition to increased competition chinese regulators have announced aggressive policy initiatives and quotas for the sale of electric vehicles 

certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market at times with challenging leadtime to implement such requirements these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit many of our operations primarily in china are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners interests in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties fines or other related actions for these activities 

the international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and a variety of other political economic and regulatory risks including changes in government leadership changes in laws or regulations impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products and political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices and source raw materials components systems and parts on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our current practice changes in tax laws economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends especially between the us and china more detailed inspections new or higher tariffs for example on products imported from mexico into the us new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements for example the north american free trade agreement or nafta or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate with the effect of

competition from new market entrants differing local product preferences and product requirements including fuel economy vehicle emissions and safety impact of compliance with us and other foreign countries’ export controls and economic sanctions liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws differing labor regulations and union relationships and difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations 

any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world these facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products systems components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions the inability to manufacture there may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policies we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses which may be excluded under our insurance policies 

any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems components raw materials and parts as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts that ultimately derive from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions disputes financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers including takata corporation takata which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including production of certain of our higher margin vehicles where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely 

high prices of raw materials used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability increases in prices for raw materials that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products systems components and parts such as steel precious metals nonferrous metals including aluminum copper and plastic parts may lead to higher production costs for parts and components this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs many of our competitors have responded to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices as a result we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives commodity or other cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness 

domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low cost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours and there are no guarantees that gms intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those product and services there may be instances where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm takes

general motors company and subsidiaries 

reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of enforcement of patents by third parties including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks if we are found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services 

security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products including connected vehicles owned or maintained by us gm financial or thirdparty vendors or suppliers on our behalf could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes activities and products additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these systems and products and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers computer viruses or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to these systems and products the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and products similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products such events could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies we have experienced such events in the past and although past events were immaterial future events may occur and may be material 

portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design manufacture and sell products and services and interrupt other business processes 

security breaches and other disruptions of our invehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products  our vehicles contain complex information technology systems these systems control various vehicle functions including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock functions we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our products are subject to extensive laws governmental regulations and policies that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matters section of item 1 business for further information on these regulatory requirements we also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally 

 13 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame however there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of safety or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

many of our advanced technologies including autonomous present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty 

we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits stockholder litigation and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines significant reputational harm civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs in addition we may become obligated to issue up to 30 million shares of our common stock subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends stock splits and other transactions to the motors liquidation company guc trust guc trust under a provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and general motors corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust as estimated by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york bankruptcy court exceed 350 billion at december 31 2017 the bankruptcy court estimated that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately 319 billion 

if in the discretion of the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york the us attorneys office we do not comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the us attorneys office may prosecute us for charges alleged by the us attorneys office including those relating to faulty ignition switches on september 17 2015 we announced that we entered into the dpa with the us attorneys office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls announced in february and march of 2014 relating to faulty ignition switches under the dpa we consented to among other things the filing of a twocount information the information in the us district court for the southern district of new york the southern district charging gm with a scheme to conceal material facts from a government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charges alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the us attorneys office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extensions thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any us federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the monitor the us attorneys office may in its discretion either prosecute us on the charges alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the us attorneys office would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the costs to complete a recall or customer satisfaction action could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform concerns about the safety of our products including advanced technologies like autonomous whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in product delays recalls lost sales governmental investigations regulatory action private claims lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry

we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts including but not limited to air bag inflators from third parties from time to time these items may have performance quality or reputational issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs for example we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles further recalls if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our business 

for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we may continue to restructure or divest our operations in various countries but we may not succeed in doing so in 2017 we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations which may result in impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our operations we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our operations while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering and other expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles and to continue to innovate our technology product and service offerings to meet changing customer needs and market developments are likely to increase 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles we rely on gm financial in north america south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers 

as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its retail and commercial finance activities its ability to access a variety of financing sources including the assetbacked securities market and other secured and unsecured debt markets the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by delinquencies defaults or prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies and changes to regulation supervision and licensing across various jurisdictions including new regulations or sanctions imposed in the us by the department of justice sec and consumer financial protection bureau 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve 

 15 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 16  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

our future funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds

nongaap measures unless otherwise indicated our nongaap measures  discussed in this mda  are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations or our assets and liabilities held for sale  our nongaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted presented net of noncontrolling interests earnings per share epsdilutedadjusted effective tax rateadjusted etradjusted return on invested capitaladjusted roicadjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures   

these nongaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance furthermore these nongaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roicadjusted management uses these measures in its financial investment and operational decisionmaking processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes further our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performancebased compensation plans for these reasons we believe these nongaap measures are useful for our investors   

ebitadjusted ebitadjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges related to goodwill impairment charges on longlived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies for ebitadjusted and our other nongaap measures once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item we will also adjust the related nongaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item   

core ebitadjusted beginning in 2018 we intend to report a core ebitadjusted metric core ebitadjusted will be used by management and can be used by investors to review our core consolidated operating results core ebitadjusted begins with ebitadjusted and excludes the ebitadjusted results of our autonomous vehicle operations including cruise automation inc cruise maven and our investment in lyft 

epsdilutedadjusted epsdilutedadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis epsdilutedadjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less income loss from discontinued operations on an aftertax basis adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt obligations on an aftertax basis and certain income tax adjustments divided by weightedaverage common shares outstandingdiluted examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances   

etradjusted etradjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis etradjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for epsdilutedadjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments   

roicadjusted   roicadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions we define roicadjusted as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roicadjusted average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities exclusive of capital leases average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits opeb liabilities and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale   

adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet such as prepayments of debt and discretionary

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the worlds most valued automotive company our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes zero emissions zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience leading in technology and innovation including electrification autonomous data monetization and connectivity growing our brands making tough strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10 core margins on an ebitadjusted basis 

in addition to our ebitadjusted margin improvement goal our overall financial targets include total annual operational and functional cost savings of 65 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs of which approximately 55 billion has been realized as of december 31 2017  and which will more than offset our planned incremental investments in brand building engineering and technology as we launch new products and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda 

for the year ending december 31 2018  we expect epsdiluted and epsdilutedadjusted to be in the midsix dollar range we do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results we expect core ebitadjusted and core adjusted automotive free cash flow to be in line with 2017 core consists of all operations excluding our autonomous vehicle operations including cruise maven car sharing entities and our investment in lyft 

we face continuing challenges from a market operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to among other factors weak economic conditions competitive pressures our product portfolio offerings emissions standards foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty as a result of these conditions we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital refer to item1a risk factors for a discussion of these challenges as we continue to assess our performance additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required or determination may be made that the carrying amount of our longlived assets may not be recoverable in certain of these countries such a determination may give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations 

gmna    in the year ended december 31 2017  industry sales in north america were 215 million  units representing a decrease of 15  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  us industry sales were 176 million units in the year ended december 31 2017 

in the year ended december 31 2017  our vehicle sales in the us our largest market in north america totaled 30 million  units for market share of 171  representing an increase of 01  percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2016  we continue to lead the us industry in market share 

we achieved ebitadjusted margins of 107  on continued strength of us industry light vehicle sales key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings based on our current cost structure we estimate gmna’s breakeven point at the us industry level to be in the range of 100 to 110 million units we expect to sustain an ebitadjusted margin of 10 in 2018  on continued strength of us industry light vehicle sales favorable mix of fullsize trucks and crossovers relative to passenger cars key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings

gmi    in the year ended december 31 2017  china industry sales were 283 million  units and our market share was 143  we continue to see strength in sales of our cadillac and baojun passenger vehicles and suvs as well as positive momentum in chevrolet sales driven by new product launches wuling sales were impacted by the market shift away from mini commercial vehicles in the year ended december 31 2017  our automotive china jvs generated equity income of 20 billion  we expect low industry growth in 2018  and continuation of pricing pressures which will continue to pressure margins we continue to expect equal to increased vehicle sales in 2018 driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income by focusing on improvements in vehicle mix cost efficiencies and downstream performance optimization 

many markets across the region continue to improve led by increases in argentina and brazil leading to industry sales of 252 million  units representing an increase of 40  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period in 2016  in the year ended december 31 2017  our retail sales totaled 13 million  units leading to a market share of 51  representing a decrease of 03  percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2016  

in may 2017 we announced several restructuring actions in gmi which were primarily related to the withdrawal of chevrolet from the indian and south african markets at the end of 2017 and the transition of our south african manufacturing operations to isuzu motors these actions occurred as a result of a strategic decision to focus resources on opportunities expected to deliver higher returns refer to note 19  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these restructuring actions in may 2017 we deconsolidated our business in venezuela which resulted in a charge of 01 billion during the year ended december 31 2017  

gm korea company gm korea entered into a collectively bargained wage agreement which was ratified by its union in january 2018 the impact of the agreement was not material to our consolidated financial statements 

we have had recent discussions with key stakeholders in gm korea including its minority owners and union regarding the need to improve gm koreas financial and operational performance as we strategically assess our performance and the manner in which we operate in korea and certain other countries additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations 

corporate    beginning in 2012 through january 30 2018  we purchased an aggregate of 504 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 162 billion 

the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries investigations subpoenas requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of us federal state and canadian governments in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages fines civil consent orders civil and criminal penalties or other remedies refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

takata matters   in may 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phasedstabilized ammonium nitratebased propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multiyear riskbased schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time temperature cycling and environmental moisture 

although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicles within scope of the takata dirs in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may 27 2016 updated as of june 13 2016 covering 25 million of certain of our gmt900 vehicles which are fullsize pickup trucks and suvs on november 15 2016 we filed a petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding those gmt900 vehicles on november 28 2016 nhtsa granted gm’s deferral request in connection with this petition the deferral provides gm until august 31 2017 to present evidence and analysis that our vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety 

we filed a second set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 10 2017 these january 2017 dirs are consistent with gm’s may 2016 dirs on the same day we also filed a second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2017 dirs on january 18 2017 nhtsa consolidated our first and second petitions for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time 

 23 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

on august 25 2017 we filed a supplemental brief in support of our petitions that provided nhtsa with the results of our longterm study and testing and the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required in our brief we requested that nhtsa grant our petitions or in the alternative grant an additional deferral period to provide time for further testing 

we filed a third set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 9 2018 these january 2018 dirs are consistent with gms may 2016 dirs and january 2017 dirs on the same day we also filed a third petition for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2018 dirs 

we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk for example the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles and include features such as greater venting unique propellant wafer configurations and machined steel end caps the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass 

accordingly no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the us we estimate a reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately 10 billion 

gm is engaged in discussions with regulators outside the us with respect to takata inflators there are differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the us we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators we were required to recall certain vehicles sold outside of the us in the three months ended september 30 2017 to replace takata inflators in these vehicles additional recalls if any could be material to our results of operations and cash flows we continue to monitor the international situation 

on june 26 2017 takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states and japan over the past several months a group of global automakers including gm have had discussions with takata and key safety systems inc regarding a potential transaction involving the sale of takatas business gm has not experienced any supply interruptions arising from takata initiating formal insolvency proceedings and anticipates that takata will continue an uninterrupted supply of component parts to gm during the insolvency proceedings gm continues to monitor takata’s financial and operational performance and to develop alternative and contingent supplies to attempt to mitigate prospective threats to the supply of components 

psa group transaction   on july 31 2017 we closed the sale of our opelvauxhall business to psa group and on october 31 2017 we closed the sale of the fincos to banque psa finance sa and bnp paribas personal finance sa 

the net consideration paid at closing for the european business was 25 billion consisting of 1 22 billion in cash and 2 08 billion in warrants in psa group partially offset by 3 the 05 billion derisking premium payment made to psa group for assuming certain underfunded pension liabilities in addition we agreed to sell the shares of psa group received upon exercise of the warrants within 35 days after exercise the purchase price is subject to certain working capital adjustments as provided in the master agreement the agreement 

the total charge from the sale of the european business was 62 billion net of tax of which 39 billion is recorded in income loss from discontinued operations net of tax and 23 billion was treated as an adjustment to both epsdilutedadjusted and etradjusted the charge relates to 1 43 billion of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable or that transferred to psa group 2 15 billion related to previously deferred pension losses and payment of the derisking premium to psa group for its assumption of certain underfunded pension liabilities 3 a pretax disposal loss of 05 billion as a result of the sale of the fincos which includes the recognition of 02 billion of foreign currency translation losses 4 a pretax charge of 04 billion for the cancellation of production programs resulting from the convergence of vehicle platforms between the european business and psa group and 5 other costs to support the separation of operations to be provided for a period of time following closing partially offset by proceeds 

our wholly owned subsidiary the seller has agreed to indemnify psa group for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the agreement and for certain other liabilities including emissions and product liabilities the company has entered into a guarantee for the benefit of psa group and pursuant

general motors company and subsidiaries 

to which the company has agreed to guarantee the sellers obligation to indemnify psa group certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations thresholds andor caps as to the amount of required payments we are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible overall amounts or range of loss that may result from claims made under these indemnities if any 

psa group has provided a number of working capital and other adjustments under the agreement and other ancillary agreements many of which are customary in these types of transactions we currently believe that postclosing adjustments under the agreement if any would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

we retained net underfunded pension liabilities of 68 billion owed primarily to current pensioners and former employees of the european business with vested pension rights psa group assumed pursuant to the agreement approximately 31 billion of net underfunded pension liabilities primarily with respect to active employees of the opelvauxhall business and during the three months ended september 30 2017 the seller made payments of 34 billion in respect of these assumed liabilities which includes pension funding payments for active employees and the derisking premium payment discussed above at closing we drew upon our threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these payments we issued debt securities thereafter to repay the draw on our credit facility as part of the retained pension liabilities described above we retained the uk defined benefit pension plans in existence at signing related to the opelvauxhall business including responsibility for service cost accruals through the closing date 

we have agreed to purchase from and supply to psa group certain vehicles for a period of time following closing and not to engage in certain competing businesses in europe for a period of three years

gm financial has the ability to borrow up to 10 billion  against our threeyear 40 billion  revolving credit facility and up to 30 billion  against our fiveyear 105 billion  revolving credit facility we have a support agreement with gm financial which among other things establishes commitments of funding from us to gm financial this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities 

credit facilities in the normal course of business in addition to using its available cash gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities which may be secured or unsecured and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy at december 31 2017  secured committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled 260 billion  01 billion  and 24 billion  with advances outstanding of 47 billion  an insignificant amount and 24 billion  

gm financial cash flow dollars in billions 



in the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to an increase in net leased vehicle income partially offset by increased interest expense and operating expenses 

in the year ended december 31 2017  net cash used in investing activities decreased due primarily to 1 increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of 41 billion 2 increased collections and recoveries on retail finance receivables of 30 billion and 3 decreased purchases of leased vehicles of 03 billion partially offset by 4 increased net purchases of retail finance receivables of 55 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2016  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 44 billion and 2 increased purchases and funding of finance receivables of 19 billion partially offset by 3 increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of 15 billion 4 increased collections on finance receivables of 14 billion and 5 prior year impact of cash used for the acquisition of the equity interest in saicgmac of 09 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2017  net cash provided by financing activities decreased due primarily to an increase in repayments of 124 billion and a special dividend payment to gm of 06 billion partially offset by an increase in borrowings of 90 billion and the issuance of preferred stock of 10 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to a net increase in borrowings 

offbalance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or finance receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2017  and 2016  refer to note 17  of our consolidated financial statements for detailed information related to guarantees we have provided and for our noncancelable operating lease obligations 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or fixed minimum price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction based on these definitions the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities the

the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities certified preowned extended warranty and free maintenance of 91 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of 16 billion  due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts 

critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

 37 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in december 2017  an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions primarily those related to the fixed income asset class the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets increased from 62  at december 31 2016  to 66  at december 31 2017  the assumption change related to the fixed income asset class is expected to increase the return on assets by 03 billion  in 2018 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment 

we have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31 2017  and determined that our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31 2017  us pension plan obligations 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 40 billion  and 38 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  the yearoveryear change is primarily due to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by assumption changes and the increase in actual return on assets at december 31 2017   24 billion  of the unamortized pretax actuarial loss is outside the corridor 10 of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weightedaverage amortization period is approximately fifteen years resulting in amortization expense of 02 billion  in 2018  

the underfunded status of the us pension plans decreased by 14 billion  in the year ended december 31 2017  to 58 billion  due primarily to 1 a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 65 billion  2 other favorable changes including contributions demographic gains and assumption changes of 04 billion  partially offset by 3 an unfavorable effect due to a decrease in the discount rate of 32 billion  and 4 service and interest cost of 23 billion  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets 

 38 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

at december 31 2017  total deferred tax assets were 307 billion  and valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets were 67 billion  refer to note 18  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and for information on the impact of us tax reform legislation 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms which typically range from two to five years at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on thirdparty data which considers inputs including recent auction values the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles used car prices manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands 



at december 31 2017  the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was 304 billion  we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straightline basis the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2017  which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio holding all other assumptions constant 



we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make year and model into leased asset groups check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards a leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicators exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flows including the expected residual value are lower than the carrying value of the asset group we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2017 2016 or 2015 

product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models 

in gmna we primarily accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale in the other regions there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarialbased estimation technique and the estimated costs are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced 

 39 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall campaigns the number of vehicles per recall campaign the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 03 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product the product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue due to incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives on january 1 2018 the date of our adoption of accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 sales incentives began to be recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or announcement this change affected our processes for estimating and recording sales incentives refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption asu 201409

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

automotive the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2017  our most significant foreign currency exposures were the us dollarcanadian dollar us dollarmexican peso eurous dollar us dollarchinese yuan australian dollarus dollar and us dollarargentine peso derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2017  

  

the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 08 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 01 billion  and 02 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  

 41 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivatives in asset positions with notional amounts of 28 billion  and 53 billion  and in liability positions with notional amounts of 12 billion  and 05 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 151 billion  and 114 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 07 billion  and 05 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  

we had marketable securities of 83 billion  and 118 billion  classified as availableforsale at december 31 2017  and 2016  the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2017  and 2016  

automotive financing  gm financial 

interest rate risk   fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt typically retail finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial may be pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

quantitative disclosure   we have historically presented a quantitative measure of our interest rate risk in a tabular disclosure of our interestsensitive assets and liabilities with the expansion of our international and north america asset liability committees in 2015 to incorporate more assetliability management strategies we now measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to economic value of equity could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below these interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements 

under these interest rate scenarios we are assetsensitive meaning that we expect more assets than liabilities to reprice within the next twelve months during a period of rising interest rates the interest earned on our assets will increase more than the interest paid on our debt which would initially increase our net interest income during a period of falling interest rates we would expect 

 42 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our net interest income to initially decrease the following table presents our net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement 



 

 

additional model assumptions   the sensitivity analysis presented is our best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios however our actual results could differ our estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio originations of finance receivables and leases refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives our prepayment projections are based on historical experience if interest rates or other factors change our actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps in asset positions with notional amounts of 28 billion  and an insignificant amount and in liability positions with notional amounts of an insignificant amount and 08 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

 item 1 business 

general motors company sometimes referred to as we our us ourselves the company general motors or gm was incorporated as a delaware corporation in 2009 we design build and sell cars trucks crossovers and automobile parts worldwide we also provide automotive financing services through general motors financial company inc gm financial except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified amounts presented within tables are stated in millions 

automotive our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments gm north america gmna gm europe gme gm international operations gmio and gm south america gmsa 

gm primarily meets the demands of customers in north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet and gmc brands gm primarily meets the demands of customers outside north america with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the buick cadillac chevrolet gmc holden opel and vauxhall brands we also have equity ownership stakes in regional joint ventures jvs which meet the demands of customers in asia with vehicles developed manufactured andor marketed under the baojun buick cadillac chevrolet jiefang and wuling brands 

in addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers including daily rental car companies commercial fleet customers leasing companies and governments our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network such as maintenance light repairs collision repairs vehicle accessories and extended service warranties 

competitive position and vehicle sales the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design price quality available options safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely we present both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share 

wholesale vehicle sales data which represents sales directly to dealers and others including sales to fleet customers is the measure that correlates to our revenue from the sale of vehicles which is the largest component of automotive net sales and revenue wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles sold by joint ventures in the year ended december 31 2016  463  of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the us the following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment vehicles in thousands 



retail vehicle sales data which represents sales to end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management including sales to fleet customers does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period however retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume in countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available other data sources such as wholesale or forecast volumes are used to estimate retail vehicle sales to end customers 

retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles used by dealers under courtesy transportation programs and vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel primarily in europe this sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator loaner and selfregistered vehicles which are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies the following table summarizes total industry retail sales or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available of vehicles and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

the sales and market share data provided in the table above includes both fleet vehicle sales and sales to retail customers certain fleet transactions particularly sales to daily rental car companies are generally less profitable than sales to retail customers a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under us gaap with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



the following table summarizes us fleet sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2017  we plan to continue to price vehicles competitively including offering incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen our brands 

cyclical nature of business retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved

general motors company and subsidiaries 

location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product and business development and intellectual property costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control improved fuel economy the safety of drivers and passengers urban mobility and autonomous vehicles in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  research and development expenses were 81 billion  75 billion  and 74 billion  

product development the product development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and powertrain components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments global teams in design program management component  subsystem engineering product integrity safety propulsion and purchasing  supply chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale 

our global vehicle architecture development has been consolidated and headquartered at our global technical center in warren michigan to further the standardization of our overall vehicle development process crosssegment part sharing is an essential enabler to our vehicle set strategy designed to reduce our overall number of global vehicle architectures to four major vehicle sets as we implement the four vehicle sets we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles we are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eassist plugin hybrid full hybrid extended range and battery electric vehicles we currently offer six models in the us featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt in 2016 we began production and sales of the chevrolet bolt ev which provides an eparated 238 miles of range on a full charge 

car and ridesharing in 2016 we executed several steps in our strategy to redefine personal mobility in january 2016 we announced a new carsharing service called maven which combines our multiple carsharing programs under a single brand maven gives customers access to highly personalized ondemand mobility services during 2016 we expanded our maven offerings to 16 cities across the us in january 2016 we also purchased a 9 equity ownership interest in lyft inc lyft a privately held company for 05 billion in march 2016 we announced a new program called express drive which leverages our lyft relationship to expand our ridesharing offerings under the express drive program lyft drivers in multiple cities across the us can rent general motors vehicles on a weekly basis we are also considering additional options to expand our ridesharing offerings in november 2016 we announced that we are partnering with uber technologies inc uber to pilot a program under which uber drivers can rent general motors vehicles on a weekly basis additionally we plan to develop an integrated network of ondemand autonomous vehicles in the us 

autonomous technology we see autonomous technology leading to significant advances in convenience mobility and safety since more than 90 of crashes are caused by driver error we have millions of miles of realworld experience with embedded connectivity through onstar llc onstar and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that we believe will eventually lead to fully autonomous vehicles an example of advanced automation is super cruise a handsfree driving customer convenience feature that will debut in 2017 on the cadillac ct6 sedan 

in may 2016 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cruise automation inc cruise an autonomous vehicle technology company to further accelerate our development of autonomous vehicles we are also actively testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in san francisco california scottsdale arizona and warren michigan

alternative fuel vehicles we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we currently offer 11 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2017  model year to retail customers plus an additional seven models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two in brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace in addition we are studying ethanolbased fuels as well as other highoctane fuel blends and the role they can play in maximizing efficiencies of future internal combustion engine technology development to meet the escalating fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission regulations in the us and other markets 

we produce cng bifuel capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira tourer and the opel combo van in the us we are developing a program to offer a wide selection of truck and van options through a specialty vehicle manufacturing program operating on cng or lpg which are suitable for fleet and commercial applications and retail customers alike availability is scheduled to begin in 2017 globally we offer cng and lpg capable vehicles in select markets reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources 

hydrogen fuel cell technology as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than 3 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology we are exploring nontraditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas including demonstrations with the us army and us navy 

we signed a codevelopment agreement with honda motor company in october 2016 for a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for the 2020 timeframe for commercialization the collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon gms and honda motor companys strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology 

fuel efficiency we are committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions and 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 

onstar onstar is a whollyowned subsidiary of gm serving more than 72 million subscribers in the us canada mexico china through a joint venture south america and europe onstar is a provider of connected safety security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2017  model year vehicles onstars key services include automatic crash response stolen vehicle assistance remote door unlock turnbyturn navigation vehicle diagnostics handsfree calling and 4g lte wireless connectivity 

intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole these patents are important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks combined purchases

from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 11 to 12 of our total purchases in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system and inuse compliance monitoring may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirements become more stringent each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required throughout the world with very little harmonization of global regulations zero emission vehicle zev requirements have been adopted by some us states as well as the canadian province of quebec and there is the possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt zev requirements in the future while we believe all our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers this includes vehicle emissions testing including co 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing and review of emission control strategies 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and various state governments impose additional requirements canada’s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the us federal requirements each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the us environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

carbs latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in zevs which must be offered for sale in california carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals the epa has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year but do not include zev requirements these new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the zev requirements 

emissions in the european union are regulated by the european commission ec and by governmental authorities in each european union member state eu member states the ec imposes emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 eu member states we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority in one eu member state before we can sell vehicles in any eu member state the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program the european union requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation to the framework of the united nations economic commission for europe 

the existing level of european union exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 6 was effective in 2014 for new vehicle approvals and 2015 for new vehicle registrations future emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles by introducing new testing criteria based on “real world driving” emissions rde rde tests will become effective in 2017 the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to manufacture to comply with rde tests we believe it will be necessary to implement technologies which will introduce additional cost pressures on the already challenging european union market for small and midsize diesel vehicles declines in diesel penetration may make fleet co 2  compliance more challenging gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements the potential implementation of technology into gasoline vehicles to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions may further increase the cost of gasoline engines and could have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy 

in addition increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards including the implementation of rde tests as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased costs penalties lack of certainty with respect to product portfolio planning negative publicity or reputation impact for us refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks

in the longterm we expect that the ec will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle rde low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd 

china has implemented european type china 4 standards nationally with european obd requirements for new vehicle registrations cities such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou each currently require china 5 standards for new vehicle registrations china implemented the china 5 standards for light duty gasoline nationwide at the beginning of 2017 the china 5 standards include more stringent emission requirements and increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance china officially released a unique china 6 emission standard with the potential to combine elements of both european and us standards local implementation is expected as early as 2018 nationwide implementation for new registrations is expected in july 2020 for the base china 6a standard and july 2023 for the more stringent china 6b standard 

in south america certain countries follow the us test procedures standards and obd requirements and others follow the european union test procedures standards and obd requirements with different levels of stringency brazil implemented national l6 standards for light diesel vehicles in 2012 and obd installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015 l6 standards for light gasoline vehicles were implemented in 2015 for all models 

automotive fuel economy    in the   us corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2017 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 381 mpg our import car standard is estimated to be 417 mpg and our lightduty truck standard is estimated to be 276 mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program through the 2017 model year in addition to federal cafe reporting the epa requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the cafe program our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2017 model year carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2017 model years although canada has no parallel cafestyle fuel economy regulations there are canadian greenhouse gas regulations that are aligned with the us epa regulations and canadian fleets are expected to be compliant with these regulations through the 2017 model year we regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and greenhouse gas regulations 

unlike other jurisdictions the european unions climate change policy framework focuses on fleet average co 2  emissions rather than fuel economy the european union has implemented legislation regulating fleet average co 2  emissions in europe and has adopted an even more stringent fleet average co 2  target for 2020 requirements must be met through the introduction of co 2  reducing technologies on conventional gasoline and diesel engines or through ultralow co 2  vehicles we are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe the ec will also devise regulatory requirements on the co 2 emission test cycle as of 2017 

china has both an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement based on phase 3 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on phase 4 standards effective in 2016 the china phase 4 fleet fuel consumption standard is based on curb weight with full compliance to 50 l100 km required by 2020 china has continued subsidies for plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china proposes a phase 5 fleet fuel consumption standard effective beginning in 2021 with full compliance to 40l100km required by 2025 

in brazil the government has set fuel economy requirements called inovar auto original equipment manufacturers have mandatory fleet average compliance required by october 2017 resulting in a reduction from 2012 levels the brazilian government provides indirect tax incentives to eligible participant companies that meet certain requirements including these fuel economy targets the level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the timing and degree to which the targets are met participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and specific fines 

industrial environmental control    our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste disposal we are committed to converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfillfree operations at december 31 2016  100 or approximately 60 of our manufacturing operations were landfillfree additionally we have 52 

 7 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

nonmanufacturing operations that are landfillfree at our landfillfree manufacturing operations approximately 90 of waste materials are reused or recycled and approximately 10 are converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities including construction demolition and remediation wastes we estimate that we reused recycled or composted over 25 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations converted over 137000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at wastetoenergy facilities and avoided approximately 9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the year ended december 31 2016  

in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of material reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we have committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by 2050 at december 31 2016  we had implemented projects globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 167 megawatts in 2016 we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at 12 of our sites globally   by reducing energy intensity an average of 18 at these sites to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 in five years or fewer two of the sites achieved the goal for the first time bringing the total number of gmowned sites to have met the epa challenge to 75 with many sites achieving the goal multiple times these efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target 

  chemical regulations we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of chemicals or substances of concern by mandating broad prohibitions green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing chemical restrictions in canada are progressing rapidly as a result of environment canada’s chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic in  june 2016 the us enacted the chemical safety for the 21 st century act  that grants the epa more authority to regulate and ban chemicals from use in the us and is expected to increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date 

in 2007 the european union implemented its regulatory requirements the eu reach regulation among others to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the european union to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 under this regulation “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be used to address future requirements we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date 

there are various regulations in china stipulating the requirements for chemical management among other things these regulations catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substances the failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the china market 

safety    in the us the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the us that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa if we or nhtsa determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business and the results of our operations could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below the risks described below are not the only risks facing our operations risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry our business could suffer  we believe that the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry these nontraditional participants may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies new products or services new business models or new methods of travel it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry as our business evolves the pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historically core business such as autonomous vehicles car and ridesharing and transportation as a service if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing building and selling high quality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2017  successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability in addition our growth strategies require us to make significant investment in our brands to appeal to new markets 

our longterm profitability depends upon successfully creating and funding technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers although we will seek to obtain intellectual property protection for our innovations to protect our competitive position it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions and changes in styling preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles

our profitability is dependent upon the success of fullsize pickup trucks and suvs while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small midsize and large cars crossovers sport utility vehicles suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our fullsize pickup trucks and suvs our success is dependent upon consumer preferences and our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicles whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of global political instability or other reasons could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and suvs 

our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume changes to which can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic conditions we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share 

the international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign regulations and expose us to a variety of domestic and foreign political economic and other risks including changes in foreign or domestic government leadership changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell products and political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices and source raw materials components systems and parts on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our current practice changes in domestic or foreign tax laws economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends especially between the us and china more detailed inspections new or higher tariffs for example on products imported from mexico into the us new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements or changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations such as china significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate with the effect of competition from new market entrants and in the united kingdom uk with passage of a referendum to discontinue membership in the european union differing local product preferences and product requirements including fuel economy vehicle emissions and safety impact of compliance with us and other foreign countries’ export controls and economic sanctions liabilities resulting from us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws differing labor regulations and union relationships and difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit many of our operations primarily in china are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties fines or other related actions for these activities 

we are subject to extensive laws governmental regulations and policies including those regarding fuel economy and emissions controls that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental 

 12 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions a significant challenge with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matters section of item 1 business for further information on these regulatory requirements we also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally for example in germany the ministry of transportation and the kraftfahrtbundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers including our german subsidiary in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested from time to time written responses from our subsidiary on the subject our german subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines in addition the german and the eu parliaments have instigated inquiry commissions into government agencies oversight of emissions enforcement requesting our german subsidiarys participation at the same time the german government has initiated further industrywide inquiries about co 2 emissions this scrutiny regulatory changes or novel interpretations of current regulations as well as increased enforcement has led to and may result in further increased testing and retesting of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems which could lead to increased costs penalties negative publicity or reputational impact and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us 

we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs alternative compliance measures may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirements 

in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violations of safety or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

we could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other legal proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits stockholder litigation and governmental investigations such as the legal proceedings related to the ignition switch recall such legal proceedings could in the future result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

if in the discretion of the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york the office we do not comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the office may prosecute us for charges alleged by the office including those relating to faulty ignition switches on september 17 2015 we announced that we entered into the dpa with the office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls announced in february and march of 2014 relating to faulty ignition switches under the dpa we consented to among other things the filing of a twocount information the information in the us district court for the southern district of new york charging gm with a scheme to conceal material facts from a government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charges alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extensions thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any us federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the office may in its discretion either prosecute us on the charges alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the office would be permitted to rely

upon the admissions we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls could materially adversely affect our business government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts including but not limited to air bag inflators from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs for example we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata corporation takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles we are continuing to assess the situation further recalls if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our business in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation potentially expose us to significant monetary penalties and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems components raw materials and parts as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers including takata which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including production of certain of our higher margin vehicles where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely 

we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities around the world we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world these facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions the inability to manufacture vehicles there may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers we may not be able to easily shift production of vehicles at an inoperable facility to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policies we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses which may be excluded under our insurance policies 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness 

domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low cost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles in addition foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers including gm and its joint venture partners these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle

we may continue to restructure or divest our operations in various countries but we may not succeed in doing so we face difficult market and operating conditions in certain parts of the world that may require us to restructure or rationalize these operations which may result in impairments in many countries across our regions we have experienced challenges in our operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may be material 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our automotive operations we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering and other expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles and to continue to innovate our technology and product offerings to meet changing customer needs and market developments are likely to increase 

security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles information technology networks and systems could interfere with the safety of our customers or our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology networks and systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of vehicle or business processes and activities additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and invehicle systems and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems and invehicle systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or computer viruses the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen these occurrences could also impact vehicle safety we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past and future attacks are likely to occur if successful these types of attacks on our network or systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices or service failures could result in among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition any such access disruption technological failures disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles we rely on gm financial in north america europe south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers any reduction in gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers 

as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its retail and commercial finance activities its ability to access a variety of financing sources including the assetbacked securities market and other secured 

 15 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

and unsecured debt markets the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio which could be materially affected by delinquencies defaults or prepayments wholesale auction values of used vehicles higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers fluctuations in interest rates and currencies and changes to regulation supervision and licensing across various jurisdictions including new regulations or sanctions imposed in the us by the department of justice sec and consumer financial protection bureau 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements are described in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds

nongaap measures our nongaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted presented net of noncontrolling interests epsdilutedadjusted return on invested capitaladjusted roicadjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures 

these nongaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance furthermore these nongaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roicadjusted management uses these measures in its financial investment and operational decisionmaking processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes further our board of directors uses these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performancebased compensation plans for these reasons we believe these nongaap measures are useful for our investors 

ebitadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges related to goodwill impairment charges on longlived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies for ebitadjusted and our other nongaap measures once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item we will also adjust the related nongaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item 

epsdilutedadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis epsdilutedadjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less certain adjustments noted above for ebitadjusted and gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt obligations on an aftertax basis as well as redemptions of preferred stock and certain income tax adjustments divided by weightedaverage common shares outstandingdiluted examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances 

roicadjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions we define roicadjusted as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities exclusive of capital leases average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits opeb liabilities and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period 

adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet such as prepayments of debt and discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda for our reconciliation of net automotive cash provided by used in operating activities under us gaap to this nongaap measure

the following table summarizes the calculation of roicadjusted dollars in billions 



 

 

overview our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve our goal of 9 to 10 margins on an ebitadjusted basis ebitadjusted margins calculated as ebitadjusted divided by net sales and revenue by early next decade earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience lead in technology and innovation including onstar 4g lte and connected car alternative propulsion urban mobility including ride and carsharing through maven and our investment in lyft active safety features and autonomous vehicles grow our brands particularly the cadillac brand in the us and china and the chevrolet brand globally continue our growth in china continue the growth of gm financial into our full captive automotive financing company and deliver core operating efficiencies 

in addition to our ebitadjusted margin improvement goal our overall financial targets include expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of 65 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs of which approximately 4 billion has been realized as of december 31 2016 and which we expect will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2017 and beyond and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda 

for the year ending december 31 2017  we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved total net sales and revenue ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins that equal or exceed the corresponding amounts in 2016 roicadjusted of greater than 25 automotive operating cash flow of approximately 15 billion adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately 6 billion and epsdiluted and epsdilutedadjusted of between 600 and 650 we do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results we expect these financial results in part to be driven by favorable shifts in mix for our new or refreshed product launches including crossovers

we face continuing challenges from a market operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to among other factors weak economic conditions competitive pressures our product portfolio offerings emissions standards foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty as a result of these conditions we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital as we continue to assess our performance additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required or a determination may be made that the carrying amount of our longlived assets may not be recoverable in certain of these countries such a determination may give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations 

gmna in the year ended december 31 2016 industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 219 million  units representing a 17  increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to strong consumer demand driven by credit availability low interest rates and low fuel prices 

in the year ended december 31 2016  our vehicle sales in the us our largest market in north america totaled 30 million  units for market share of 170  representing a decrease of 03  percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 the decrease in our us market share was driven primarily by lower fleet market share due to a planned reduction in rental deliveries partially offset by higher retail market share us retail sales generally more profitable than fleet sales generated an increase of 05  percentage points in market share primarily driven by chevrolet 

we achieved ebitadjusted margins of 101  during 2016 on continued strength of us industry light vehicle sales new product launches and material and other cost savings which partially offset launch related costs based on our current cost structure we continue to estimate gmna’s breakeven point at the us industry level to be in the range of 100  110 million units we expect to sustain an ebitadjusted margin of 10 in 2017 on continued strength of us industry light vehicle sales key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings 

gme as a result of moderate economic growth across europe excluding russia automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers continued improving in the year ended december 31 2016 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 188 million units representing a 61 increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015 

our european operations are benefiting from this trend and vehicle sales continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall retail vehicle sales of 12 million units for market share of 57 in the year ended december 31 2016 consistent with the corresponding period in 2015 we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness 

despite the improvements we experienced through most of 2016 we were unable to overcome the impacts of the uk referendum vote to leave the european union brexit resulting in a 03 billion unfavorable impact due primarily to adverse movement in the british pound against the us dollar 

we anticipate the impacts of brexit to continue through 2017 we also anticipate headwinds associated with industry pricing pressures and increased costs associated with depreciation amortization marketing and costs associated with our new product launches we intend to mitigate these headwinds with the full benefit of our recently launched astra and mokka x along with the 2017 launches of the insignia ampera e and two new crossovers that we believe will substantially increase our competitiveness in this growing market 

the german ministry of transportation and the kraftfahrtbundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers including our german subsidiary in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested from time to time written responses from our subsidiary on the subject our german subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines in addition the german and the eu parliaments have instigated inquiry commissions into government agencies oversight of emissions enforcement requesting our german subsidiarys participation at the same time the german government has instigated further industrywide inquiries about co 2  emissions this scrutiny regulatory changes and increased enforcement has led to 

 22 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

increased testing and retesting of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems which could lead to increased costs penalties negative publicity or reputational impact and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us 

gmio in the year ended december 31 2016  china industry sales were 283 million  units representing an increase of 129  compared to the corresponding period in 2015 in the year ended december 31 2016 our china wholesale volumes increased by 49  compared to the corresponding period in 2015 our market share decreased to 138  down 11  percentage points as our volume growth was less than that of the industry strong growth in cadillac buick and baojun passenger vehicles including suvs were partially offset by lower chevrolet sales because of model changeover and lower wuling sales because of a continued segment shift away from mini commercial vehicles in the year ended december 31 2016 our automotive china jvs generated equity income of 20 billion  we expect moderate industry growth in 2017 and continuation of pricing pressures which will continue to pressure margins we continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income by focusing on vehicle mix improvements cost improvements and efficiencies and downstream performance optimization 

a weaker economy due partially to lower oil prices and foreign exchange volatility among other factors negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of asia pacific africa and the middle east and led to industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 189 million  units representing a decrease of 32  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the corresponding period in 2015 in the year ended december 31 2016  our retail sales totaled 07 million  units leading to a market share of 36  representing a decrease of 05  percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 the decrease in retail sales volumes was due primarily to overall industry volume declines foreign currency availability and economic challenges in the middle east egypt and south africa 

in 2017 we expect the operating environment to remain challenging as we strategically assess our performance and the manner in which we operate in certain countries additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations 

  gmsa the south american automotive industry continues to be challenged by weak economic conditions and lack of consumer confidence industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 37 million  units in the year ended december 31 2016 representing a 123  decrease compared to the corresponding period in 2015 in the year ended december 31 2016 our vehicle sales in brazil our largest market in south america totaled 03 million  units for market share of 169  representing an increase of 18  percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily driven by a refreshed portfolio

corporate in connection with our capital allocation program as detailed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda we previously announced that our board of directors had authorized programs to purchase up to 5 billion and 4 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016 and 2017 we completed the 5 billion program in the three months ended september 30 2016 and 1 billion of the 4 billion program in the three months ended december 31 2016 in january 2017 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional 5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs through february 1 2017  we had purchased 180 million  shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for 60 billion

takata matters   on may 4 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain an ammonium nitratebased propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multiyear riskbased schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of

general motors company and subsidiaries 

time temperature cycling and environmental moisture on may 16 2016 takata issued its first dir in connection with the amended consent order and on january 3 2017 takata issued its second set of dirs 

although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any gm vehicles within the scope of the takata dir in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may 27 2016 updated as of june 13 2016 covering 25 million of certain of our gmt900 vehicles which are fullsize pickup trucks and suvs on november 15 2016 we filed a petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding certain gmt900 vehicles equipped with takata inflators on november 28 2016 nhtsa granted gm’s deferral request in connection with this petition the deferral provides gm until august 31 2017 to present evidence and analysis that our vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety we believe that this timeline will permit us to complete our testing of the relevant nondesiccated takata inflators in gmt900 vehicles and to prove to nhtsa that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required 

takata filed a second set of equipment dirs on january 3 2017 and we filed a second set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 10 2017 these january 2017 dirs are consistent with gm’s may 2016 dirs on the same day we also filed a second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2017 dirs on january 18 2017 nhtsa consolidated our first and second petitions for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time 

we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation for example the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles and include features such as greater venting unique propellant wafer configurations and machined steel end caps the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass we believe that the results of further testing and analysis will demonstrate that the vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required accordingly no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflators in these vehicles we estimate a reasonably possible cost of up to 880 million  for the 69 million  vehicles subject to either the preliminary dirs or future takata dirs under the amended consent order 

through january 27 2017 we were aware of one putative class action pending against gm in federal court in the us one putative class action in mexico and seven putative class actions pending in various provincial courts in canada arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by takata are defective in addition the new mexico attorney general has initiated litigation against takata and numerous automotive manufacturers including gm at this early stage of these proceedings we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss

credit facilities in the normal course of business in addition to using its available cash gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities which may be secured or unsecured and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy at december 31 2016  secured committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled 258 billion  14 billion and 24 billion with advances outstanding of 98 billion  10 billion and 24 billion

in the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to an increase in leased vehicle income partially offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense 

in the year ended december 31 2016  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 45 billion and 2 increased purchases and funding of finance receivables of 20 billion partially offset by 3 increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of 15 billion 4 increased collections on finance receivables of 14 billion and 5 prior year impact of cash used for the acquisition of the equity interest in saicgmac of 09 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2015  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 104 billion 2 increased purchases and funding of finance receivables of 10 billion and 3 net cash used for the acquisition of the equity interest in saicgmac of 09 billion partially offset by 4 increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of 06 billion 

in the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to a net increase in borrowings 

offbalance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or finance receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016  and 2015  refer to note 15  of our consolidated financial statements for detailed information related to guarantees we have provided and for our noncancelable operating lease obligations 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or fixed minimum price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction based on these definitions the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities at december 31 2016

the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of 97 billion  and unrecognized tax benefits of 12 billion  due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts 

critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2016  an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the us pension plans with resulting changes to the expected longterm rate of return on assets the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 63  at december 31 2015 to 62  at december 31 2016 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows effective 2016 we applied the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost this refinement more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment the refinement reduced the service cost and interest cost in 2016 by  08 billion  there was no effect on the determination of the plan obligations which continues to be calculated using the assumed discount rate 

we have reviewed and incorporated the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31 2016 that lowered life expectancies and thereby indicated the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payments to our us pension plans participants was decreasing this change in assumption decreased the december 31 2016 us pension and opeb plans’ benefit obligations by 09 billion 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 48 billion  and 37 billion  at december 31 2016 and 2015 the yearoveryear change is primarily due 

 37 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by assumption changes primarily the us mortality improvement scale at december 31 2016 29 billion of the unamortized pretax actuarial loss is outside the corridor 10 of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weightedaverage amortization period is approximately twelve years resulting in amortization expense of 02 billion in 2017 

the underfunded status of the us pension plans decreased by 32 billion in the year ended december 31 2016 to 72 billion due primarily to 1 a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 40 billion 2 contributions of 21 billion and 3 favorable assumption changes primarily the us mortality improvement scale of 09 billion partially offset by 4 interest and service cost of 24 billion and 5 an unfavorable effect due to a decrease in discount rates of 15 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant 



 

 

refer to note 14  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions investment strategies assumptions the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category 

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions governmental legislative actions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets 

at december 31 2016 total deferred tax assets were 40 billion  and valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets were 46 billion  refer to note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances 

if law is enacted that reduces the us statutory tax rate we would record a significant onetime reduction to the net deferred tax assets and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms ranging from two to five years at the beginning of the lease contract a determination is made of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased assets the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guides since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustments to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination changes adjustments could result in a change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists an impairment charge 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands

at december 31 2016  gm financials estimated residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term was 236 billion the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2016  which will increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of gm financials operating leases holding all other assumptions constant 



product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models 

in gmna we primarily accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale in the other regions there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarialbased estimation technique and the estimated costs are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced 

the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 03 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product the product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer 

 39 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue due to incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives

automotive the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of

directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2016  our most significant foreign currency exposures were the eurobritish pound us dollarcanadian dollar eurous dollar us dollarmexican peso eurosouth korean won and us dollarsouth korean won derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2016  such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months 

  

at december 31 2016  and 2015  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 10 billion  and 08 billion  these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 02 billion  and 03 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses 



interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities at december 31 2016  and 2015  we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 116 billion  and 91 billion  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 05 billion  and 04 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  

at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had marketable securities of 118 billion  and 76 billion  classified as availableforsale and an insignificant amount and 06 billion  classified as trading the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at december 31 2016  and 2015

interest rate risk fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt typically retail finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect 

 41 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial may be pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of 227 billion  and 104 billion  and in liability positions with notional amounts of  295 billion  and  139 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments in asset positions was insignificant and in liability positions was 341 million and insignificant at december 31 2016 and 2015 

the following table summarizes gm financials interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities excluding derivatives by year of expected maturity and the fair value of those assets and liabilities at december 31 2016  





the impact of gm financials discount rate prepayment and credit loss assumptions is consistent with assumptions applied to interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities reported at december 31 2015 gm financial estimates the realization of finance receivables in future periods using discount rate prepayment and credit loss assumptions similar to its historical experience credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classified based on expected payoff senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on maturity 

foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps in asset positions with notional amounts of 16 billion  and 15 billion  and in liability positions with notional amounts of 910 million  and an insignificant amount at december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

retail vehicle sales data which represents sales to the end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management including fleets does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period however retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume in countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available other data sources such as wholesale or forecast volumes are used to estimate sales to the end customers 

retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel primarily in europe this sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator loaner and selfregistered vehicles these vehicles are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies the following table summarizes total industry retail sales or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available of new vehicles and our related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

in the year ended december 31 2015  we estimate we had the largest market share in north america and south america the number two market share in the asiapacific middle east and africa region which included the largest market share in china and the number seven market share in europe in the year ended december 31 2015  the asiapacific middle east and africa region was our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 454  of our global retail vehicle sales 

our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2015  grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry resulting in a 02 percentage point  industry share decline our market share decreased due primarily to the change of our business model in russia our vehicle price increases in brazil and our planned reduction of fleet sales in the us refer to the overview section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda for detail partially offset by our market share increase in china driven by strong performance of existing products and successful new launches including new sport utility vehicles   suvs cadillac vehicles and multipurpose vehicles our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2014  grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry resulting in a 01 percentage point  industry share decline our market share decreased due primarily to the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from europe and economic conditions and competitive environment in brazil partially offset by our market share increase in china driven by improved performance of existing products and successful launches of new vehicles 

fleet sales and deliveries 

the sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales certain fleet transactions particularly daily rental are generally less profitable than retail sales a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under us gaap with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



the following table summarizes us fleet sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing

general motors company and subsidiaries 

several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2016  we plan to continue to price vehicles competitively including offering incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands 

cyclical nature of business 

retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product and business development and intellectual property 

costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control improved fuel economy the safety of drivers and passengers urban mobility and autonomous vehicles in the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  research and development expenses were 75 billion  74 billion  and 72 billion

car and ridesharing 

in january 2016 we announced the next step in our strategy to redefine personal mobility with a new carsharing service called maven which combines our multiple carsharing programs under a single brand and will expand its offerings to multiple cities and communities across the us maven gives customers access to highly personalized ondemand mobility services in january 2016 we purchased a 9 equity ownership interest in lyft inc lyft a privately held company for 05 billion which we will leverage to expand our ridesharing offerings we also plan to develop with lyft an integrated network of ondemand autonomous vehicles in the us 

autonomous technology 

we see automation and autonomous technology leading to significant advances in convenience mobility and safety since more than 90 of crashes are caused by driver error we have millions of miles of realworld experience with embedded connectivity through onstar and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features and eventually to fully autonomous vehicles an example of an advanced automation is super cruise a handsfree driving customer convenience feature that we expect to debut in 2017 on the cadillac ct6 sedan we are also working on autonomous systems and in 2016 plan to demonstrate the capabilities of a fleet of chevrolet volts on our 20000employee global technical center campus these vehicles will be ordered by a mobile phone application to go to the requested location and drive employees to their destination 

alternative fuel vehicles 

we believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector by leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we currently offer 12 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2016 model year to retail customers plus an additional seven models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we continue to study the future role flexfuel vehicles may play in the us in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development

general motors company and subsidiaries 

of the refueling infrastructure in brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace 

we produce cng bifuel capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira and in the us with the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans fleet and commercial customers and the chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra 2500 hd pickup trucks commercial and retail customers that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and cng in addition we offer the cng bifuel chevrolet impala fullsize sedan to both fleet and retail markets in the us we offer lpg capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold 

we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than 3 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology 

gm and honda motor company entered into a longterm agreement to codevelop a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for the 2020 timeframe the collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon gms and honda motor companys strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology 

fuel efficiency 

we are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions and 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 

intellectual property 

we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials primarily include steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10 to 11 of our total purchases in the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

 6 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system and inuse compliance monitoring may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirements become more stringent each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required throughout the world without harmonization of global regulations zero emission vehicle zev requirements have been adopted by some us states and there is the possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt zev requirements in the future while we believe all our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with vehicle emissions requirements regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers this includes vehicle emissions testing including co 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing in europe and review of emission control strategies 

us and canada 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments canada’s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the us federal requirements each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the us environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

carbs latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in zevs offered by the same automaker such as electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals the epa has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year but do not include zev requirements these new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the zev requirements the province of quebec has also announced its intention to adopt a zev requirement 

european union   

emissions are regulated by the european commission ec and by governmental authorities in each european union member state eu member states the ec imposes emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 eu member states we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority in one eu member state before we can sell vehicles in any eu member states the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program the european union requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation to the framework of the united nations economic commission for europe 

the existing level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 6 was effective in 2014 for new vehicle approvals and 2015 for new vehicle registrations future european union emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles by introducing new testing criteria based on “real world driving” emissions rde rde tests will become effective in 2017 the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with rde tests we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those already in production to meet us emission standards these technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging european union market for small and midsize diesel vehicles gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements the measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

in addition increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards following the wellpublicized emissions scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer may result in changes to these standards including the implementation of rde tests as well as stricter interpretations of these standards and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased costs penalties negative publicity or reputation impact for us refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of these risks 

 7 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the longterm we expect that the ec will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd 

china 

china has implemented european type china 4 standards nationally with european obd requirements for all newly registered vehicles cities such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou each currently require china 5 standards for newly registered vehicles in total 11 eastern municipalities and provinces will require china 5 standards prior to nationwide implementation in 2017 the china 5 standards include more stringent emission requirements and increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance china is considering a unique china 6 emission standard with the potential to combine elements of european and us standards local implementation is expected as early as 2019 

automotive fuel economy 

us and canada 

corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2016 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 362 mpg our import car standard is estimated to be 400 mpg and our lightduty truck standard is estimated to be 271 mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program through the 2016 model year in addition to federal cafe the epa requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the cafe program our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2016 model year carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2016 model years although canada has no parallel cafestyle fuel economy regulations there are canadian greenhouse gas regulations that are aligned with the us epa regulations and the canadian fleets are expected to be compliant with the canadian regulations through the 2016 model year 

europe 

the eu has implemented legislation regulating fleet average co 2  emissions in europe and has adopted an even more stringent fleet average co 2  target for 2020 requirements must be met through the introduction of co 2  reducing technologies on conventional gasoline and diesel engines or through ultralow co 2  vehicles we are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe the ec will also devise regulatory requirements on the co 2 emission test cycle as of 2017 

china 

china has both an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement based on phase 2 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on phase 3 standards based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 calendar years implementation began in 2012 with full compliance to 69l100km required by 2015 china has continued subsidies for fuel efficient vehicles plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china is now working on a more aggressive phase 4 fleet fuel consumption standard that is expected to apply beginning in 2016 with full compliance to 50l100km required by 2020 

industrial environmental control 

our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste disposal we are committed to converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfillfree operations at december 31 2015 90 or approximately 50 of our manufacturing operations were landfillfree additionally we have 41 nonmanufacturing operations that are landfillfree at our landfillfree manufacturing operations approximately 89 of waste materials are reused or recycled and 9 are converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities including construction demolition and remediation wastes we estimate that we reused recycled or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global 

 8 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

manufacturing operations converted over 140000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at wastetoenergy facilities and avoided approximately 9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the year ended december 31 2015 

in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production byproducts reduce our use of material reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency at december 31 2015 we had implemented projects globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 105 megawatts in 2015 we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at seven of our sites globally   by reducing energy intensity an average of 22 at these sites to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 in five years or fewer three of the sites achieved the goal for the first time bringing the total number of gmowned sites to have met the epa challenge to 73 with many sites achieving the goal multiple times these efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target 

  chemical regulations 

we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

us and canada 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of chemicals or substances of concern by mandating broad prohibitions green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing chemical restrictions in canada are progressing more rapidly than in the us as a result of environment canada’s chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date 

the us congress is currently pursuing an update of the toxic substances control act to grant the epa more authority to regulate and ban chemicals from use in the us which if passed is expected to greatly increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements the eu reach regulation among others to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 under this regulation “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements we believe that we are materially in compliance with these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date 

safety 

in the us the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the us that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa if we or nhtsa determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

 9 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures adding complexity to regulatory compliance refer to note 11  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on significant recall activities in 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm is dependent upon our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers 

we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing building and selling high quality cars and trucks is critical to our longterm profitability we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2016  successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our shortterm profitability in addition our growth strategies require us to make significant investment in our brands to appeal to new markets 

our longterm profitability depends upon our successfully creating and funding technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers although we will seek to obtain intellectual property protection for our innovations to protect our competitive position it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle and a number of factors may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs including competitors’ product introductions technological innovations fuel prices general economic conditions and changes in styling preferences an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable our high proportion of fixed costs both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles 

our profitability is dependent upon the success of fullsize pickup trucks and suvs 

while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small midsize and large cars crossovers suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our fullsize pickup trucks and suvs our success is dependent upon consumer preferences and our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes any increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of 

 12 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

oil including as a result of global political instability could cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuel efficient vehicles and weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and suvs 

our business is highly dependent upon the global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume changes to which can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic conditions we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations primarily in china are carried out by joint ventures in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more parties we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture particularly when we own a minority interest as a result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture moreover a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties fines or other related actions for these activities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks 

the majority of our vehicles are sold outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including 

  13

we are subject to extensive laws governmental regulations and policies including those regarding fuel economy and emissions control the enforcement of which or changes to existing ones could cause us to incur increased costs or to face regulatory enforcement action and may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions a notable challenge with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties in addition an evolving but unharmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matters section of item 1 business for a discussion of these regulatory requirements we also expect that manufacturers will be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally as a result of the wellpublicized emissions scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer in 2015 for example government agencies in several countries have asked us for information one of these the german ministry of transportation is requesting the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers including our german subsidiary in discussions on emissions control issues and has requested a written response from our subsidiary on the subject this scrutiny regulatory changes and increased enforcement may lead to increased testing and retesting of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems which could lead to increased costs penalties negative publicity or reputational impact and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding fuel economy and emission control requirements we expect that to comply with these requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs alternative compliance measures may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirements 

environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions possible fines restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

we could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other legal proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits stockholder litigation and governmental investigations such as the legal proceedings related to the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of mda for additional information on the ignition switch recall such legal proceedings could in the future result in the imposition of damages including punitive damages substantial fines civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

if in the discretion of the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york the office we do not comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the office may prosecute us for charges alleged by the office including those relating to faulty ignition switches 

on september 17 2015 we announced that we entered into the dpa with the office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls announced in february and march 2014 relating to faulty ignition switches under the dpa we 

 14 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

consented to among other things the filing of a twocount information the information in the us district court for the southern district of new york charging gm with a scheme to conceal material facts from a government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charges alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extensions thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any us federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the office may in its discretion either prosecute us on the charges alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the office would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties that could have material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns under these standards we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs at present the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part we currently source a variety of systems components raw materials and parts including but not limited to air bag inflators from third parties from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs for example based on defect information reports filed with nhtsa by tk holdings inc takata we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles we are continuing to assess the situation further recalls if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation potentially expose us to significant monetary penalties and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule 

our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems components raw materials and parts as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could in turn disrupt our operations including production of certain of our higher margin vehicles where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely 

we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities around the world 

we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world these facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles in some cases certain facilities produce products that disproportionately contribute a greater degree of profit to the company than others should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons including labor disruptions the inability to manufacture vehicles there may result in harm to our reputation increased costs lower revenues and the loss of customers we may not be able to easily shift production of vehicles at an inoperable facility to other facilities or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policies we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses which may be excluded under our insurance policies 

if we do not deliver new products services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry our business could suffer 

 15 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we believe that the automotive industry will experience more change in the next five years than it has in the previous 50 years in addition to our traditional competitors we must also be responsive to the entrance of nontraditional participants in the automotive industry these nontraditional participants may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies new products or services new business models or new methods of travel it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry as our business evolves the pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historically core business if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations market developments and changing customer needs our sales profitability and longterm competitiveness may be harmed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness 

manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a low cost alternative to established entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

we may continue to restructure our operations in various countries but we may not succeed in doing so 

we face difficult market and operating conditions in certain parts of the world that may require us to restructure impair or rationalize these operations in many countries across our regions we have experienced challenges in our operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries as we continue to assess our performance throughout the regions additional restructuring impairment and rationalization actions may be required and may be material 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles information technology networks and systems could interfere with the safety of our customers or our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information 

we rely upon information technology networks and systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of vehicle or business processes and activities additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and invehicle systems and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems and invehicle systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or computer viruses the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen these occurrences could also impact vehicle safety we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past with no known material impacts and future attacks are likely to occur if successful these types of attacks on our network 

 16 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

or systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

we rely on gm financial in north america europe south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers any reduction of gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers 

as an entity operating in the financial services sector gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms processes procedures controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial’s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationships 

the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include 

 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in laws or regulations changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns 

our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans 

 17 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns assuming other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements are described in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

nongaap measures 

management uses earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted to review the operating results of our automotive segments because it excludes interest income interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments gm financial uses income before income taxesadjusted because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment examples of adjustments to ebit and gm financials income before income taxes include certain impairment charges related to goodwill other longlived assets and investments certain gains or losses on the settlementextinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of noncore investments refer to note 23  to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measure under us gaap net income attributable to stockholders 

management uses earnings per share epsdilutedadjusted to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis epsdilutedadjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders less certain adjustments 

 20 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

noted above for ebitadjusted on an aftertax basis as well as certain income tax adjustments divided by weightedaverage common shares outstanding – diluted 

management uses return on invested capital roic to review investment and capital allocation decisions we define roic as ebitadjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for certain assets and liabilities during the same period 

management uses adjusted free cash flow to review the liquidity of our automotive operations we measure adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section of mda for our reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable financial measure under us gaap net cash provided by operating activities 

management uses these nongaap measures in its financial and operational decision making processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as they provide additional transparency of our core operations these measures allow management and investors to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions 

our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures 

the following table reconciles epsdilutedadjusted to its most comparable financial measure under us gaap diluted earnings per common share 



 

 

the following table summarizes the calculation of roic dollars in billions 



overview 

our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve 9 to 10 margins on an ebitadjusted basis ebitadjusted margins calculated as ebitadjusted divided by net sales and revenue by early next decade earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience lead in technology and innovation including onstar 4g lte and connected car alternative

propulsion urban mobility including ride and car sharing active safety features and autonomous vehicles grow our brands particularly the cadillac brand in the us and china and the chevrolet brand globally continue our growth in china continue the growth of gm financial into our full captive automotive financing company and deliver core operating efficiencies 

for the year ending december 31 2016 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins epsdilutedadjusted of between 525 and 575 and automotive adjusted free cash flow of approximately 6 billion 

our overall financial targets include expected improvement of forecasted consolidated ebitadjusted margins of 9 to 10 by early next decade expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of 55 billion by 2018 that will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond expected average adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately 6 billion to 7 billion from 2016 to 2018 expected consolidated roic of 20 plus and execution of our capital allocation strategy as described below 

automotive summary and outlook 

we analyze the results of our automotive business through our four geographicallybased segments 

gmna 

automotive industry volume continued to grow in north america primarily driven by the us market in 2015 us industry light vehicle sales were 175 million units up 10 million units from 2014 based on our current cost structure and variable profit margins we estimate gmna’s breakeven point at the us industry level to be in the range of 100  110 million units 

in the year ended december 31 2015  our us vehicle sales totaled 31 million units for a us market share of 173 representing a decrease of 01 percentage points compared to 2014 the decrease in our us market share was primarily driven by lower fleet market share partially offset by higher retail market share us retail market share which is generally more profitable than us fleet market share increased by 04 percentage points primarily driven by chevrolet and gmc 

we achieved ebitadjusted margins of 103 during 2015 ebitadjusted margin improvements were impacted by favorable volumes and mix and favorable cost performance including materials logistics and recallrelated charges refer to the gm north america section of the mda for additional information on recall activity we expect to sustain an ebitadjusted margin of 10 in 2016 due to a consistent to slight increase in us industry light vehicle sales key product launches continued cost performance and growth of adjacent businesses 

in november 2015 we entered into a collectively bargained labor agreement with the uaw the agreement which has a term of four years covers the wages hours benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our uaw represented employees the key terms and provisions of the agreement are

gme 

automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers began to improve in late 2013 as a result of moderate economic growth across europe excluding russia this trend continued in the year ended december 31 2015 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 177 million  vehicles representing a 93  increase compared to 2014 in russia industry sales to retail and fleet customers decreased 361  to 16 million  vehicles compared to the corresponding period in 2014 

our european operations are benefiting from this trend and despite seasonally weak vehicle sales in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2015 continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall market share in the year ended december 31 2015  which builds on our market share increases in 2013 and 2014 

we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness the key actions include investments in our product portfolio including the recently launched next generation opel astra and corsa a revised brand strategy and reducing material development and production costs including restructuring activities the success of these actions will depend on a combination of our ability to execute and external factors which are outside of our control 

economic and market conditions in russia remain and are expected to continue to be very challenging for the foreseeable future in addition we do not have appropriate localization levels for key vehicles built in russia and we would need to make significant future capital investments in order to improve our localization levels so that our products are competitive in the russian market as a result of these conditions we determined that our russia business model was not sustainable over the long term in 2015 we ceased manufacturing eliminated opel brand distribution and minimized chevrolet brand distribution in russia refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the change in our business model in russia 

in addition to the impact of the restructuring of our russia business model we anticipate headwinds from aggressive industry pricing along with increased costs associated with depreciation amortization marketing adverse foreign currency impact and increased costs associated with our new product launches we anticipate these headwinds will be offset by continued industry recovery the full benefits of our recent launches of the astra and corsa and material cost optimization as a result we intend to break even in gme in 2016 

the german ministry of transportation is requesting the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers including our german subsidiary in discussions on emission controls issues and has requested a written response from our subsidiary on the subject this request may lead to increased testing and retesting of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems which could lead to increased costs penalties negative publicity or reputational impact and additional vehicles may be subject to recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us refer to item 1a risk factors for additional information 

gmio 

in the year ended december 31 2015 gmio operated in a volatile and challenging economic environment 

in china we are experiencing a moderation of industry growth and pricing pressures higher than we initially anticipated due primarily to macroeconomic volatility softening consumer demand particularly in the commercial vehicle segment increasing competition and a complex regulatory environment this has resulted in 42  growth in industry sales to 251 million  units in 2015 despite these pressures we achieved record wholesale volumes of 37 million  units with market share of 149  in the year ended december 31 2015 up 02 percentage points compared to 2014 the increase in our market share was primarily driven by our successful launches in our key growth segments of suvs multipurpose vehicles and luxury vehicles including the buick envision and baojun 560 and 730 baojun 560 became the second bestselling suv in china two months after its launch and the baojun 730 has been the market leader in its segment since launching in august 2014 we opened two new facilities in 2015 and will be adding a third jinqiao shanghai plant in 2016 consistent with our localization strategy

in the year ended december 31 2015 our automotive china jvs generated equity income of 21 billion  and sustained strong margins despite higher than anticipated pricing pressures with carryover price reductions of approximately 5  for saic general motors corp ltd sgm and moderation of industry growth this was largely attributed to proactive management of challenges by optimizing vehicle mix and inventory levels and aggressively reducing costs in 2016 we expect continuation of moderate industry growth macroeconomic volatility and carryover pricing pressures in the range of 3 to 5 despite the challenging macroeconomic environment we continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income and margins by focusing on vehicle mix improvement and cost efficiency 

lack of political stability decreasing prices of natural resources and foreign exchange volatility among other factors negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of asia pacific africa and the middle east and led to a decrease of 02 million  units or 10  in the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 this continued the recent trend of a relatively flat industry of approximately 19 million  units sold in each of the last several years in the year ended december 31 2015 our sales volume decreased by 52  compared to 2014 leading to a decline in market share of 02 percentage points to 42  

in 2016 we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging we continue to refresh our product portfolio and are addressing many of the challenges in these markets while continuing to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries to address the significant industry market share pricing and foreign exchange pressures in the region we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancements manufacturing footprint rationalization increased local sourcing of parts cost structure reductions as well as brand and dealer network improvements which we expect to favorably impact the region over the medium term the impact of these strategic actions combined with the significant reduction in wholesale volumes forward pricing pressures and foreign exchange volatility in the region may result in deteriorating cash flows in certain markets 

  

in 2013 we announced the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from western and central europe and the ceasing of manufacturing and significant reduction of engineering operations in australia by 2017 and incurred related impairment and other charges in the years ended december 31 2013 2014 and 2015 we continue to work on a southeast asia transformation plan including the transition of our indonesian operations to a national sales company and ceased vehicle production in indonesia in the three months ended june 30 2015 we are restructuring our thailand operations to focus on our competitive strengths in trucks and suvs given continued challenges in thailand and several export markets as a result of these strategic actions related to thailand we recorded impairment charges of 03 billion  in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended june 30 2015 which were treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes 

we continue to execute our plans and within the financial impact that we projected as we continue to assess our performance throughout the region additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations 

gmsa 

economic conditions in south america were negatively impacted by falling commodity prices and political uncertainty during 2015 as a result brazil our largest market in south america contracted during 2015 and continues to be negatively impacted by foreign currency deflation high interest rates and increasing levels of unemployment automotive industry sales in brazil decreased by 09 million vehicles or 266 in the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014 

in the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded currency devaluation charges of 06 billion and asset impairment charges of 01 billion in venezuela which is experiencing a severe economic recession the devaluation and asset impairment charges were recorded in automotive cost of sales and were treated as adjustments for ebitadjusted reporting purposes we continue to monitor developments in venezuela to assess whether market restrictions and exchange rate controls when considered with the economic and political environment in venezuela evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest 

in the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 04 billion related to prepayment of unsecured debt in brazil which is not a component of ebitadjusted 

we continue to monitor economic conditions in south america and believe that adverse economic conditions and their effects on the automotive industry will continue in the near term while we continue to take actions to address these challenges no assurance can be provided that such efforts will prevent material future losses asset impairments or other charges

in march 2015 management announced its plan to return all available free cash flow to stockholders while maintaining an investmentgrade balance sheet managements capital allocation framework includes a combined cash and marketable securities balance target of 20 billion and plans to reinvest in the business at an average target roic rate of 20 or more in connection with this plan we announced that our board of directors had authorized a program to purchase up to 5 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016 in january 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional 4 billion of our common stock or an aggregate total of 9 billion before the end of 2017 at february 1 2016  we had purchased 102 million  shares of our outstanding common stock for 35 billion  also in january 2016 we announced an increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to 038 per share effective in the first quarter of 2016 

in 2014 we created a compensation program to compensate accident victims as a result of the vehicles recalled under the ignition switch recall in the year ended december 31 2015 we increased our independently administered accrual for the ignition switch recall compensation program by 195 million based on the programs claims experience the increase to the accrual was recorded in automotive selling general and administrative expense and was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes total charges recorded since inception of the compensation program were 595 million at december 31 2015 the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries investigations subpoenas requests for information and complaints from the us attorneys office for the southern district of new york congress the sec transport canada and 50 state attorneys general in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits we recorded charges of approximately 16 billion  in automotive selling general and administrative expense as a result of the dpa financial penalty and the settlements of the shareholder class action the multidistrict litigation and other litigation associated with the recalls these charges were treated as adjustments for ebitadjusted reporting purposes in the year ended december 31 2015 refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages fines civil consent orders civil and criminal penalties or other remedies there can be no assurance as to how the resulting consequences if any may impact our business reputation consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the total amount accrued at december 31 2015 represents our best estimate with regard to such claims and lawsuits however we are currently unable to estimate either a high end of the range for these claims and lawsuits or a range of possible loss for the remaining matters because they involve significant uncertainties the resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the three months ended december 31 2015  we concluded it was more likely than not that our future earnings in certain jurisdictions in gme will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions so that a full valuation allowance is no longer needed accordingly we reversed gme valuation allowances of 39 billion  and recorded an income tax benefit as a result we have a negative effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  refer to note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances

venezuelan operations 

our venezuelan subsidiaries functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy 

effective march 31 2014 we changed the exchange rate for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the venezuela official exchange rate to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by venezuela’s complementary system of foreign currency administration sicad the devaluation resulted in a charge of 04 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended march 31 2014 which was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes 

in the three months ended june 30 2015 we changed the exchange rate for remeasuring these monetary assets and liabilities from the sicad rate to the sistema marginal de divisas simadi rate which was bsf 198 to 100 at june 30 2015 this devaluation resulted in a charge of 06 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended june 30 2015 which was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes simadi is a third currency exchange mechanism announced by the venezuelan government in 2015 it is an open system of supply and demand expected to be limited to a small percentage of total us dollar transactions using official mechanisms we believe the simadi rate is the most representative rate to be used for remeasurement because it is more reflective of economic reality in venezuela and future transactions including dividends at the sicad rate appear unlikely 

due to the adverse movements in the foreign currency exchange rate and the continued weakness in the venezuelan market we performed recoverability tests of certain assets including our real and personal property assets in the three months ended june 30 2015 as a result we recorded asset impairment charges of 01 billion in automotive cost of sales which were treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes 

we continued to consolidate our venezuelan subsidiaries because of recent favorable election results settlements of new debt by the venezuelan government participation in simadi currency exchange and vehicle production in the year ended december 31 2015 additionally we expect to have the ability to continue vehicle production in a limited manner during 2016 and into early 2017 absent ongoing vehicle production our venezuelan subsidiaries may require additional financial support at this time no decision has been made whether we will provide further financial support if required despite the significant challenges in venezuela this market continues to be important to us we will continue to monitor developments in venezuela to assess whether market restrictions and exchange rate controls evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest if a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain control we may incur a charge based on exchange rates at december 31 2015 of approximately 02 billion

the following table summarizes gm financials available liquidity dollars in billions 



in the year ended december 31 2015  available liquidity increased due primarily to 1 decreased usage of secured debt facilities as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes and 2 decreased usage of committed unsecured lines of credit primarily due to funding provided by retail banking deposits in germany 

gm financial has the ability to borrow up to 20 billion against each of our threeyear 50 billion and fiveyear 75 billion revolving credit facilities in september 2014 we and gm financial entered into a support agreement which among other things established commitments of funding from us to gm financial this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities 

credit facilities 

in the normal course of business in addition to using its available cash gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities which may be secured or unsecured and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy at december 31 2015 secured and committed unsecured credit facilities totaled 224 billion  and 15 billion  with advances outstanding of 75 billion  and 06 billion  

cash flow 

the following table summarizes gm financial cash flows from operating investing and financing activities dollars in billions 



operating activities 

in the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to an increase in leased vehicle income partially offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense 

 39 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the year ended december 31 2014  net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to larger finance receivable and lease portfolios 

investing activities 

in the year ended december 31 2015  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 an increase in purchases of leased vehicles of 104 billion 2 an increase in finance receivables purchases and fundings net of collections of 10 billion and 3 net cash used for the acquisition of the equity interest in saicgmac of 09 billion partially offset by 4 increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of 06 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2014  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased loan purchases and funding net of collections of 26 billion and 2 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 25 billion partially offset by 3 decreased cash used for business acquisitions of 26 billion 

financing activities 

in the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to a net increase in borrowings 

in the year ended december 31 2014  net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased borrowings under secured and unsecured debt of 56 billion and 2 repayment of debt to ally financial of 14 billion in 2013 with no related activity in 2014 partially offset by 3 increased debt repayment of 28 billion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015  and 2014  refer to note 15  of our consolidated financial statements for detailed information related to guarantees we have provided 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on these definitions the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities 

the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities at december 31 2015  dollars in millions

general motors company and subsidiaries 



 

 

the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of 93 billion  and unrecognized tax benefits of 14 billion  due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts 

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

pension and opeb plans 

our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the 

 41 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2015  an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the us pension plans with resulting changes to the expected longterm rate of return on assets the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 64  at december 31 2014 to 63  at december 31 2015 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans 

another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows effective 2016 we will apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost this refinement more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment the refinement had no effect on service cost or interest cost in the year ended december 31 2015 but will reduce the service cost and interest cost in 2016 by approximately  08 billion  there will be no effect on the determination of the plan obligations which will continue to be calculated using the assumed discount rate 

we have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31 2015 and determined our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31 2015 us pension plans’ benefit obligations 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial loss on our pension plans was 37 billion  and 46 billion  at december 31 2015 and 2014 the change is primarily due to the increase in discount rates partially offset by actual asset returns less than assumed returns at december 31 2015 20 billion of the unamortized pretax actuarial loss is outside the corridor 10 of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weightedaverage amortization period is approximately 12 years resulting in amortization expense of 02 billion in 2016 

the underfunded status of the us pension plans decreased by 05 billion in the year ended december 31 2015 to 104 billion due primarily to 1 a favorable effect due to an increase in discount rates of 26 billion 2 a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of 08 billion and 3 favorable contributions of 01 billion partially offset by 4 interest and service cost of 30 billion 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



refer to note 13  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions investment strategies assumptions the change in benefit obligation and related plan assets pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category 

valuation of deferred tax assets 

the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation 

 42 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets 

at december 31 2015 valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were 50 billion  refer to note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and information on the 39 billion  income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in europe 

valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals 

gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms ranging from two to five years at the beginning of the lease contract a determination is made of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased assets the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guides since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustments to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination changes adjustments could result in a change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists an impairment charge 

the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases net vehicles in thousands 



at december 31 2015  gm financials estimated residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term was 134 billion the following table illustrates the effect of a 1 change in the estimated residual values at december 31 2015  which will increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of gm financials operating leases holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



policy product warranty and recall campaigns 

in gmna we accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale in the other regions there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarialbased estimation technique and the estimated costs will be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced 

the estimates related to policy and product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event estimates contemplate the 

 43 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

nature frequency and magnitude of historical events with consideration for changes in future expectations costs associated with campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost number of units impacted and the take rate depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary we consider trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims 

the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 03 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee committees of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations at december 31 2015  our most significant foreign currency exposures were the eurobritish pound eurous dollar us dollarmexican peso eurosouth korean won us dollarsouth korean won and us dollarcad derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2015  such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 20 months 

  

at december 31 2015  and 2014  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 08 billion  and 09 billion  these amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been 03 billion  and 02 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses dollars in millions 



interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities at december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2015  and 2014  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 91 billion  and 98 billion  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would have been 04 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014

general motors company and subsidiaries 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had marketable securities of 76 billion  and 80 billion  classified as availableforsale and 06 billion  and 13 billion  classified as trading the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at december 31 2015  and 2014

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt typically retail finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of 104 billion  and 38 billion  and interest rate swaps and caps in liability positions with notional amounts of  139 billion  and  74 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps in asset positions with notional amounts of 15 billion  and 16 billion  and in liability positions with notional amounts of 0  and 11 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

retail vehicle sales data which represents estimated sales to the end customer including fleets does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period however retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles is the basis for our market share and is based upon the good faith estimates of management retail vehicle sales data includes sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture certain joint venture agreements in china allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of nongm trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume but estimates may be used where retail vehicle sales volume is not available 

in countries where end customer data is not readily available other data sources such as wholesale or forecast volumes are used to estimate retail vehicle sales certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies the following table summarizes total industry retail sales volume or estimated sales volume where retail sales volume is not available of new vehicles and the related competitive position by geographic region vehicles in thousands

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the following table summarizes the vehicle sales at our china joint ventures china jvs that are included in our retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



in the year ended december 31 2014  we estimate we had the largest market share in north america and south america the number six market share in europe and the number two market share in the asiapacific middle east and africa region in the year ended december 31 2014  the asiapacific middle east and africa region was our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 441  of our global retail vehicle sales 

our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2014  grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry resulting in a 01  industry share decline all new and refreshed vehicles gained share in 2014 but were outpaced by losses on vehicles that were late in their lifecycle largely due to an aggressive competitive environment our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2013  reflect continued recovery in the us despite an intense competitive environment growth was largely attributed to new or refreshed models our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2012  reflect an intensified competitive environment in the us including aggressive competitor pricing and media spending as well as key competitor new product launches 

fleet sales and deliveries 

the sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales certain fleet transactions particularly daily rental are generally less profitable than retail sales a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under us gaap with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations the following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



the following table summarizes us fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total us retail vehicle sales vehicles in thousands

product pricing 

several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2015  we will continue to price vehicles competitively including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices 

cyclical nature of business 

retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial ally financial inc ally financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product development and intellectual property 

costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 research and development expenses were 74 billion  72 billion  and 74 billion  

one of our priorities for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption 

fuel efficiency 

 4 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions and 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 

alternative fuel vehicles 

we believe alternative fuels offer the greatest nearterm potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we currently offer 13 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2015 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we continue to study the future role flexfuel vehicles may play in the us in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure in brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in australia thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace 

we produce cng bifuel capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira and in the us with the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans fleet and commercial customers and the chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra 2500 hd pickup trucks commercial and retail customers that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and cng in addition we recently launched the cng bifuel chevrolet impala fullsize sedan to both fleet and retail markets in the us we offer lpg capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold 

we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles 

we are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eassist plugin hybrid extended range and battery electric vehicles we currently offer seven models in the us featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology phev and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt opel ampera and cadillac elr in 2014 we introduced the cadillac elr extended range luxury coupe and introduced a secondgeneration chevrolet volt at the 2015 north american international auto show the nextgeneration chevrolet volt symbolizes our continued commitment to expansion of vehicle electrification and the development of accompanying electrification technologies including battery systems electric motors and advanced electronic controls 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than 3 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology 

gm and honda entered into a longterm agreement to codevelop a nextgeneration fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies aiming for the 2020 timeframe the collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon gms and honda’s strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology

product development 

our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization this strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development we define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces 

a centralized organization is responsible for many of the nonvisible parts of the vehicle such as steering suspension the brake system the heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system this team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand such as exterior and interior design tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements 

intellectual property 

we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials are primarily composed of steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity total purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10 to 11 of our total purchases from 2012 to 2014 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall emission and obd requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world 

us and canada 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments canada’s federal government vehicle criteria emission requirements are generally aligned with the us federal requirements these requirements include vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and obd system requirements each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the us environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

 6 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

while we believe all our products are in compliance with epa and carb certification requirements both agencies have ongoing “inuse” evaluations of compliance for products from all manufacturers it is possible that we or either agency could identify potential noncompliance which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue testing includes preproduction testing of vehicles as part of certification and inuse testing of customer vehicles at specified mileages 

carb has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year these requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in zero emission vehicles zev such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals the epa has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year these new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the zev requirements 

europe 

emissions are regulated by two different entities the european commission ec and the united nations economic commission for europe unece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 european union eu member states and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the unece we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the eu member states the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program eu and unece requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation 

a new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 5 was effective in 2011 future european emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles the euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2017 the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet us emission standards these technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging european market for small and midsize diesel vehicles gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements the measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

in the longterm notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in europe the ec will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd we are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date 

china 

china has implemented european type china 4 standards nationally with european obd requirements nationwide for all newly registered vehicles beijing shanghai and guangzhou each required china 5 standards by the end of 2014 for newly registered vehicles tianjin hebei province the pearl river and the yangtze river delta regions are each expected to require china 5 standards prior to nationwide implementation of china 5 in 2017 the beijing municipality is currently considering the implementation of a china unique emission standard for china 6 with the potential to combine elements of european and us standards as early as 2017 we are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date 

automotive fuel economy 

us 

corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2015 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 348 mpg our import car standard is estimated 

 7 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

at 384 mpg and our lightduty truck standard is estimated to be 256 mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program through the 2015 model year in addition to federal cafe the us epa requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the cafe program our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2015 model year carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2016 model years 

europe 

legislation regulating fleet average co 2  emissions was implemented for passenger cars in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 requirements must be met through the introduction of co 2  reducing technologies on conventional engines or ultralow co 2  vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera the eu has adopted an even more stringent co 2  regulation as of 2020 along with the passenger car target the eu also adopted a new fleet average target as of 2020 we are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

effective in 2012 an ec regulation required lowrolling resistance tires tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators an additional ec regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise fuel efficiency and rolling resistance affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket 

china 

china has both an individual vehicle passfail type approval requirement based on phase 2 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on phase 3 standards based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 calendar years implementation began in 2012 with full compliance to 69l100km required by 2015 china has continued subsidies for fuel efficient vehicles plugin hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china is now working on a more aggressive phase 4 fleet fuel consumption standard that is expected to apply beginning in 2016 with full compliance to 50l100km required by 2020 

industrial environmental control 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions water discharges waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfillfree facilities at december 31 2014 88 or approximately 50 of our manufacturing facilities were landfillfree facilities additionally we have 34 nonmanufacturing facilities that are landfill free at our landfillfree manufacturing facilities approximately 93 of waste materials are recycled or reused and 6 is converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities including construction demolition and remediation wastes we estimate that we recycled reused or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 100000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at wastetoenergy facilities in the year ended december 31 2014 

in addition to providing environmental benefits our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production byproducts reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency at december 31 2014 we have implemented projects globally that have increased our renewable energy capacity by over 35 megawatts bringing our total renewable energy capacity to over 100 megawatts in 2014 we also met the environmental protection agency energy star challenge for industry at an additional 14 of our sites globally   by reducing energy intensity an average of 17 to meet the epa challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10 in five years or fewer all 14 sites achieved the goal in no more than four years with most meeting it in less than two years bringing the total number of gmowned sites to have met the energy star challenge to 70 

  

chemical regulations 

 8 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

  

us and canada 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of chemicals or substances of concern by mandating broad prohibitions green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicles life as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing chemical restrictions in canada are progressing more rapidly than in the us as a result of environment canada’s chemical management plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity we are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date 

the us congress is currently pursuing an update of the toxic substances control act to grant the epa more authority to regulate and ban chemicals from use in the us which if passed is expected to greatly increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements the eu reach regulation among others to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 under this regulation “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements we are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date 

safety 

in the us if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than us standards refer to note 13  for more information on significant recall activities in 2014 

vehicular noise control 

in the us passenger cars and lightduty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations we identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements medium to heavyduty trucks are regulated at the federal level 

outside the us noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level we believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold in 2014 the eu published a directive that mandates a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions with a mandatory application beginning in 2016 the directive of the eu also forms the basis for amendment to unece vehicle regulations with the effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of north america 

while current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels these proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles specifically hybrids and 

 9 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

electrics may not be readily heard by pedestrians in the us national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in january 2013 and the us department of transportation indicated a final rule is expected to be published in 2015 the unece is developing a global technical regulation sponsored by the us japan and the eu for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels 

automotive financing  gm financial 

gm financial is our global captive automotive finance company gm financial conducts its business in north america and as a result of the 2013 acquisition of the ally financial international operations in europe and latin america latin america includes operations located in brazil chile colombia and mexico in january 2015 gm financial completed the acquisition of ally financials equity interest in saicgmac automotive finance company limited formerly known as gmacsaic automotive finance company limited saicgmac which conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in china 

gm financial provides consumer lending both loan and lease across the credit spectrum additionally gm financial offers commercial products to dealer customers that include new and used vehicle inventory financing inventory insurance working capital capital improvement loans fleet financing and storage center financing 

in north america gm financials consumer automobile finance programs include subprime lending full credit spectrum leasing and more recently prime lending the subprime lending program is primarily offered to consumers with fico scores of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending gm financial is currently seeking to expand its prime lending programs through our franchised dealers and anticipates that prime lending will become an increasing percentage of originations and the consumer portfolio balance over time the leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and primarily targets prime consumers leasing new vehicles 

internationally gm financial’s consumer automobile finance programs focus on financing prime quality consumers leasing in several countries and financerelated insurance products through third parties such as credit life gap and extended warranty coverage 

gm financial seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk gm financial primarily finances its loan lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities through securitization transactions where such markets are developed and through the issuance of unsecured debt 

gm financial retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by gm financial over the life of the securitization excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the assetbacked securities net of credit losses and expenses excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially retained to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to gm financial 

employees 

at december 31 2014  we employed 216000  employees of whom 136000   63  were hourly employees and 80000   37  were salaried employees at december 31 2014  51000   56  of our us employees were represented by unions a majority of which were represented by the international union united automobile aerospace and agriculture implement workers of america uaw the following table summarizes worldwide employment in thousands

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our business is highly dependent on the global automobile market sales volume which can be volatile 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment the availability of credit fluctuations in the cost of fuel consumer confidence and global economic conditions we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers 

the automotive industry particularly in the us is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and preserving our reputation for designing building and selling safe and high quality cars that meet customer preferences is critical to our longterm profitability we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2015  a successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our shortterm profitability 

the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit new talent in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers there can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

our profitability is dependent upon the success of our higher margin vehicles and luxury brands 

while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small midsize and large cars crossovers sport utility vehicles suvs and trucks we generally recognize higher profit margins on our fullsize pickup trucks and suvs our success is dependent upon consumer preferences and our ability to market our higher margin vehicles 

 13 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule 

our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems components raw materials and parts as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems components raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components raw materials and parts from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely 

an increase in cost of raw materials could materially harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business including steel aluminum copper platinum and palladium the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices some of these raw materials such as corrosionresistant steel are only available from a limited number of suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances 

designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale to enhance their competitiveness or liquidity position 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries but we may not succeed in doing so

we face difficult market and operating conditions in certain parts of the world that may require us to restructure impair or rationalize these operations in many countries across our regions we have experienced challenges in our operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries as we continue to assess our performance throughout the regions additional restructuring impairment and rationalization actions may be required and may be material the key areas of our plan include 1 investments in our product portfolio 2 a revised brand strategy and 3 reducing material development and production costs the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated as well as external economic factors which are outside of our control 

we could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or other legal proceedings related to the ignition switch recall 

we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues including product liability lawsuits stockholder litigation and governmental investigations including class actions related to the ignition switch recall such as a lawsuit for the alleged diminished value of vehicles affected by the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations mda for additional information on the ignition switch recall at this point we are unable to predict the duration scope developments in results of or consequences of the governments investigations such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of damages substantial fines civil lawsuits and criminal penalties interruptions of business modification of business practices equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs because the matters are ongoing there can be no assurance as to how the resulting consequences if any may impact our business reputation consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flow we cannot currently estimate the potential liability damages or range of potential loss as a result of the legal proceedings and governmental investigations for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

from time to time we recall our products to address performance compliance or safetyrelated issues the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

we are subject to extensive governmental laws regulations and policies including safety fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions the enforcement of which or changes to existing ones may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs including civil or criminal penalties they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue 

in the us automotive safety standards are regulated by the nhtsa whose regulators require that automotive manufacturers implement safety measures such as recalls for vehicles that do not or may not comply with relevant safety standards due to these regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs if we are required to or voluntarily decide to implement safety measures such as a recall for example we are currently facing us attorney for the southern district of new york congressional sec transport canada and state investigations related to the ignition switch recall 

in the us vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the nhtsa and the epa 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding these us regulatory requirements we expect that to comply with these requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs

general motors company and subsidiaries 

if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions possible fines or a combination of any of those items we must also cover the cost of repairs conducted under emission defect and performance warranties which apply for specified periods of time and mileage in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates changes in assumptions and investments that do not achieve adequate returns 

our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in the critical accounting estimates section of the mda and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service irs depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns as other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements are described in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonus plans we could be required to contribute more funds 

shortages of and volatility in the price of oil may cause shifts in consumer vehicle demand 

volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which provide lower profit margins any increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of political instability in the middle east south america and african nations could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and suvs which could decrease lower oil prices in oil producing countries could also impact our ability to sell vehicles in those countries 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

we rely on gm financial in north america europe south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers any reduction of gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers the factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include

our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and even if funded at anticipated levels may not result in successful vehicle applications 

we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies in 2015  largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles however if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate we may be forced to reduce delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology 

in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information 

we rely upon information technology networks and systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain management manufacturing invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of gm financial additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or computer viruses the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past with no material known impacts and future attacks are likely to occur if successful these types of attacks on our network or systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to among other things the loss of proprietary data interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation in addition any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations primarily in china are carried out by joint ventures such as shanghai general motors co ltd in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china 

we could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the us into us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks 

the majority of our vehicles are sold outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

basis of presentation 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in the three months ended march 31 2014 we changed our managerial and financial reporting structure to reclassify the results of our russian subsidiaries previously reported in our gmio segment to our gme segment we have retrospectively revised the segment presentation for all periods presented 

nongaap measures 

 21 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

management uses earnings before interest and taxes ebitadjusted to review the operating results of our automotive segments because it excludes interest income interest expense and income taxes and includes certain additional adjustments gm financial uses income before income taxesadjusted because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment examples of adjustments to ebit and gm financials income before income taxes include certain impairment charges related to goodwill other longlived assets and investments certain gains or losses on the settlementextinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of noncore investments refer to note 25  to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measure under us gaap 

management uses adjusted free cash flow to review the liquidity of our automotive operations we measure adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans refer to the “liquidity” section of mda for our reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable financial measure under us gaap 

management uses these nongaap measures in its financial and operational decision making processes for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as they provide additional transparency of our core operations these measures allow management to view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions 

our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures 

overview 

our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve 9 to 10 margins on an ebitadjusted basis ebitadjusted margins calculated as ebitadjusted divided by net sales and revenue by early next decade 1 earn customers for life by developing a strong product pipeline leading the industry in quality and safety and delivering on our commitments 2 lead the industry in product design with our lightweighting and mixed material body structures and in leading edge technology including the launch of 4g lte in china and expansion of onstar to europe 3 grow our brands particularly the cadillac brand in the us and china 4 continue our growth in china 5 continue our growth of gm financial as our captive automotive financing company and 6 deliver core operating efficiencies by institutionalizing operational excellence our financial targets include the following

automotive summary and outlook 

our consolidated net income decreased from  53 billion  to  40 billion  notwithstanding this decrease we had strong financial results in 2014  excluding the impact of recall campaign and courtesy transportation charges performance of gmna met our expectations while gme and gmio outperformed our expectations however we experienced weaker performance in gmsa due to the challenging environment in venezuela brazil and argentina 

as more fully described in the “gm north america” section of mda we recorded charges of approximately 29 billion  in automotive cost of sales relating to recall campaigns and courtesy transportation in the year ended december 31 2014 of which over 86  was recorded in gmna 

in the three months ended june 30 2014 we announced the creation of a compensation program the program to compensate accident victims who died or suffered physical injury or their families as a result of a faulty ignition switch related to the 26 million  vehicles recalled under the ignition switch recall refer to the “gm north america” section of mda for additional information on the ignition switch recall it is important to our company that we reach everyone through this program who has been impacted the program is being administered by an independent program administrator the independent administrator has established a protocol that defines the eligibility requirements to participate in the program there is no cap on the amount of payments that can be made to claimants under the program 

in the three months ended june 30 2014 we recorded 04 billion in automotive selling general and administrative expense in corporate which represents our best estimate of amounts that may be paid under the program the amount was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes however it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded amount by approximately 02 billion  the most significant estimates affecting the amount recorded include the number of participants that have eligible claims related to death and physical injury which also contemplates the severity of injury the length of hospital stays and related compensation amounts and the number of people who actually elect to participate in the program our estimate is subject to significant uncertainties as programs of this nature are highly unusual and each eligible claim will have a unique underlying fact pattern while we do not anticipate material changes to our current estimate it is possible that material changes could occur if actual eligible claims and the related compensation amounts differ from this estimate the program accepted claims from august 1 2014 through january 31 2015 payments to eligible claimants began in the fourth quarter 2014 and will continue through the first half of 2015 accident victims or their families could choose not to participate in the program and pursue litigation against us at january 30 2015  the program has received 3810  claims and the independent program administrator has determined 128  claims to be eligible for payment under the program remaining claims are either under review deficient awaiting further documentation or deemed ineligible based on currently available information we believe our accrual at december 31 2014 is adequate to cover the estimated costs under the program at january 30 2015  we have paid 93 million  to eligible claimants under the program accident victims that accept a payment under the program agree to settle all claims against gm related to the accident 

we analyze the results of our automotive business through our four geographicallybased segments 

gmna 

automotive industry volume has continued to grow in north america in 2014 us industry light vehicle sales for the calendar year were 165 million units up from 156 million units in 2013 in january 2015 we announced that we expect 2015 industry light vehicle sales to be between 165 and 170 million units 

in the year ended december 31 2014 our us retail vehicle sales increased at a rate approximately 07 percentage points less than industry sales as a result our us market share decreased by 01 percentage points us market share for both chevrolet and cadillac decreased while gmc and buick increased 

gmna continued to generate increases in average transaction prices atp in us according to jd power pin estimates in the year ended december 31 2014 we achieved record atp in the us on the strength of new products such as large pickups and 

 23 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

suvs contributing to the record atp our us incentive spending as a percentage of atp increased by 01 percentage points while industry spending increased by 04 percentage points compared to the prior year 

the first deliveries of the new 2015 chevrolet colorado and gmc canyon midsize pickups occurred in september 2014 we have announced plans to add a third shift at our wentzville mo assembly plant in early 2015 to meet expected demand for both midsize pickups and fullsize vans 

customer safety and satisfaction were the major reasons for the recall of approximately 36 million  vehicles announced during 2014  these recalls included 1 approximately 26 million  vehicles to repair ignition switches that could result in a loss of electrical power under certain circumstances that may prevent front airbags from deploying in the event of a crash accident victims who died or suffered physical injury associated with these vehicles or their families may be eligible to participate in a compensation program as more fully described in note 17  to our consolidated financial statements and to fix ignition lock cylinders that could allow removal of the ignition key while the engine is running leading to possible rollaway or crash 2 approximately 19 million  vehicles to replace either the power steering motor the steering column the power steering motor control unit or a combination of the steering column and the power steering motor control unit as the electric power steering could fail under certain circumstances 3 approximately 13 million  vehicles prone to nondeployment of the side impact restraints if vehicles are not serviced when the service air bag warning light is illuminated 4 approximately 27 million  vehicles to modify the brake lamp wiring harness that could have corrosion develop due to microvibration 5 approximately 15 million  vehicles to replace front safety lap belt cables that could fatigue and separate over time 6 approximately 14 million  vehicles to replace the shift cable that could wear out over time resulting in mismatches of the gear position indicated by the shift lever 7 approximately 121 million  vehicles to rework or replace ignition keys because the ignition switch may move out of the “run” position which may impact power steering and power braking and depending on timing of the key movement relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of a crash event may result in airbags not deploying 8 approximately 11 million vehicles to repair a loose battery cable that could impact vehicle warning systems 9 approximately 07 million vehicles to repair ignition mechanisms where the ignition key could be pulled out while the vehicle is in the run position 10 approximately 06 million vehicles to replace the wave plate in all vehicles with 6t70 and 6t75 transmissions which could crack under certain circumstances and 11 approximately 101 million vehicles for other matters in the three and six months ended june 30 2014 we recorded charges of approximately 11 billion and 24 billion primarily for the estimated costs of parts and labor to repair these vehicles and for courtesy transportation the cost of the vehicles recalled in the six months ended december 31 2014 were comprehended in the june 30 2014 catchup adjustment of 09 billion associated with a change in estimate for previously sold vehicles refer to note 1  and note 13  to our consolidated financial statements for more detail related to the catchup adjustment total net sales and revenue for gmna have increased for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to prior year by 64  it is difficult to determine the impact if any on current or future net sales and revenue due to our recent recall activity of the approximately 36 million  vehicles subject to recall approximately 63 of the vehicles and 65 of the costs involve vehicles we no longer produce or sell we began repairing vehicles in early april 2014 and we have produced sufficient parts to have the ability to repair all vehicles impacted by the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of mda for additional information on all of the recalls we announced in 2014 

in the year ending december 31 2015 we expect an increase in ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins due primarily to 1 a slight increase in us industry vehicle sales and 2 full year production of fullsize suvs partially offset by 3 increased engineering and marketing costs 

the uaw contract we entered into in september 2011 expires in september 2015 

gme 

the automotive industry conditions in europe remain challenging due to economic uncertainty resulting from weak gross domestic growth high unemployment and vehicle production overcapacity despite such conditions automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers began to improve in the three months ended december 31 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012 this trend continued in 2014 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 19 million  vehicles representing a 18  increase compared to the corresponding period in 2013 

our european operations are benefiting from this trend and continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall market share in the year ended december 31 2014 which builds on our first market share increase in 14 years in 2013 this market share increase was partially driven by the success of the recently launched opel mokka 

we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness the key actions include investments in our product portfolio including the next generation opel astra and corsa a revised brand strategy 

 24 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

and reducing material development and production costs including restructuring activities the success of these actions will depend on a combination of our ability to execute and external factors which are outside of our control 

we continue to assess additional strategic actions across the region as a result of significant volume pricing and foreign exchange pressures in certain markets which may result in additional restructuring or rationalization actions these actions if implemented may result in impairment and other charges the determination of the amount of these charges is subject to significant uncertainty and highly dependent on finalization of our strategic assessments 

our restructuring activities include our effort to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in gme whereby we reached agreement with the labor union in germany to terminate all vehicle and transmission production at our bochum germany facility at the end of 2014 affected employees are eligible for a voluntary restructuring separation program restructuring charges were recorded primarily through the end of 2014 refer to note 19  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in the year ended december 31 2014 we performed a strategic assessment of our russian operations as a result of a significant deterioration in sales volumes due to challenging market conditions and deterioration in the russian ruble our review indicated that the existing longlived assets and certain investments in our russian operations were not recoverable as a result we recorded impairment charges of 02 billion in automotive cost of sales which was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes industry and economic conditions in russia remain volatile and we continue to evaluate and execute various strategic actions to improve our operations in a difficult environment 

we expect the european automotive industry to continue to moderately improve and we expect to be profitable in gme in 2016 

in the year ending december 31 2015 we expect an increase in ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins due primarily to 1 lower restructuring costs partially offset by 2 higher engineering marketing and depreciation and amortization cost 

gmio 

we are addressing many of the challenges in our gmio operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries within gmio in 2013 we announced the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from western and central europe and the ceasing of manufacturing and significant reduction of engineering operations in australia by 2017 and incurred impairment and other charges in 2013 and 2014 we continue to execute these plans and within the financial impact that we projected as we continue to assess our performance throughout the region additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may be material 

in the three months ended december 31 2014 due to a significant decrease in domestic sales driven by political unrest and a lack of consumer confidence domestically as well as ongoing weakness and trade challenges in several export markets we performed a recoverability test of our real and personal property assets in our thailand operations as a result we recorded impairment charges of 02 billion in automotive cost of sales which was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes 

to address the significant industry market share pricing and foreign exchange pressures in the region we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancements manufacturing footprint rationalization increased local sourcing of parts cost structure reductions as well as brand and dealer network improvements which we expect to favorably impact the region over the medium term however with the significant reduction in wholesale volumes and forward pricing pressures we tested certain longlived assets for impairment and additional testing may occur in the near term determining whether longlived assets need to be tested for impairment whether recorded amounts are recoverable and the estimate of impairment and other charges if any is subject to significant uncertainty and highly dependent on finalization of our strategic assessments 

in the year ending december 31 2015 we expect an increase in ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins due primarily to 1 improved profitability at our china jvs 2 a flat to slight increase in industry vehicle sales 3 improved product mix in the middle east and 4 improved cost performance partially offset by 5 higher restructuring costs 

in china we are expecting an increase in industry vehicle sales with a modest increase in market share coupled with new vehicle launches and a full year of the 2014 launches 

gmsa 

 25 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the three months ended march 31 2014 we recorded devaluation charges of 04 billion related to a change in the exchange rate we use for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the venezuela official exchange rate to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by venezuela’s complementary system of foreign currency administration sicad i in addition to currency controls already in place the venezuelan government announced pricing controls that taken with other initiatives require us to closely monitor and consider our ability to maintain a controlling financial interest in our venezuelan subsidiaries refer to the gm south america section of mda for additional information 

in the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 02 billion  primarily related to prepayment of unsecured debt in brazil 

based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 01 billion  in the year ended december 31 2014 which was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes 

in the year ending december 31 2015 we expect an increase in ebitadjusted and ebitadjusted margins due primarily to 1 a slight improvement in market share primarily in brazil 2 improved product and country mix and 3 improved pricing partially offset by 4 higher marketing labor material and logistics costs continued foreign currency volatility will also affect our results in 2015 

corporate 

on december 31 2014 we redeemed all of our shares of series a preferred stock outstanding at a redemption price equal to the aggregate liquidation amount including accumulated dividends of 39 billion the difference of 08 billion between the carrying amount and the consideration paid was recorded as a reduction to net income attributable to common stockholders 

at december 31 2014 our european businesses had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of 49 billion  as a result of the changes in our european operating structure and improving financial performance in certain jurisdictions we are experiencing positive evidence trends in certain operations if these operations generate profits and taxable income in the future it is reasonably possible our conclusion regarding the need for full valuation allowances could change resulting in the reversal of significant portions of the valuation allowances in the quarter in which significant valuation allowances are reversed we will record a material tax benefit reflecting the reversal which could result in lower than expected or negative effective tax rate for both the quarter and full year 

automotive financing  gm financial summary and outlook 

gm financial is currently seeking to expand its prime lending programs in north america and anticipates that prime lending will become an increasing percentage of the consumer portfolio balance over time we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout economic cycles   gm financial completed the acquisitions of ally financials automotive finance and financial services businesses in europe and latin america during 2013 on january 2 2015 gm financial completed its acquisition of ally financials 40  equity interest in saicgmac in china the aggregate purchase price was approximately 10 billion  subject to certain postclosing adjustments also on january 2 2015 gm financial sold a 5  equity interest in saicgmac to shanghai automotive group finance company ltd saicfc a current shareholder of saicgmac for proceeds of approximately 120 million  subject to certain postclosing adjustments as a result of these transactions gm indirectly owns 45 of saicgmac 

in january 2015 we announced gm financial will become the exclusive us lease provider for buickgmc dealers in february 2015 and is targeting march 2015 for cadillac dealers us lease exclusivity with chevrolet dealers is under consideration 

in the year ending december 31 2015 we expect income before income taxesadjusted to remain consistent with 2014 because our nearterm financial results will be impacted by additional provisions on loan losses and interest expense resulting from the growth of the business 

consolidated results 

we review changes in our results of operations under four categories volume mix price and other volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume market share and changes in dealer stock levels mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product model trim country and option penetration in current year wholesale

liquidity overview 

gm financials primary sources of cash are finance charge income leasing income servicing fees net distributions from secured debt secured and unsecured debt borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables gm financials primary uses of cash are purchases of finance receivables and leased vehicles funding of commercial finance receivables business acquisitions repayment of secured and unsecured debt funding credit enhancement requirements for secured debt operating expenses and interest costs gm financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt 

available liquidity 

the following table summarizes gm financials available liquidity dollars in billions 



the increase in available liquidity is due primarily to the issuance of 45 billion of senior unsecured notes in the year ended december 31 2014 as well as the capital contribution from gm of 07 billion for the purchase of ally financials equity interests in saicgmac 

as previously mentioned gm financial has the ability to borrow up to 20 billion against each of our threeyear 50 billion and fiveyear 75 billion revolving credit facilities in september 2014 we and gm financial entered into a support agreement which among other things established commitments of funding from us to gm financial this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities 

credit facilities 

in the normal course of business in addition to using its available cash gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities which may be secured or unsecured and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy at december 31 2014 secured and committed unsecured credit facilities totaled 188 billion  and 13 billion  with advances outstanding of 70 billion  and 08 billion

in the year ended december 31 2013  net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to the acquisitions of the ally financial international operations 

investing activities 

in the year ended december 31 2014  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased loan purchases and funding net of collections of 26 billion and 2 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 25 billion partially offset by 3 decreased cash used for business acquisitions of 26 billion 

in the year ended december 31 2013  net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased funding of commercial finance receivables of 199 billion and purchase of consumer finance receivables of 40 billion 2 net cash payment of 26 billion made in the current year on the acquisitions of the ally financial international operations 3 increased purchases of leased vehicles of 12 billion and 4 an increase in restricted cash of 06 billion partially offset by 5 increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of 228 billion 

financing activities 

in the year ended december 31 2014  net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to 1 increased borrowings under secured and unsecured debt of 56 billion and 2 repayment of debt to ally financial of 14 billion in 2013 with no related activity in 2014 partially offset by 3 increased debt repayment of 28 billion

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2014  and 2013  

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities

the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities at december 31 2014  dollars in millions 



 

 

the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of 96 billion  and unrecognized tax benefits of 19 billion  due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts 

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

pensions 

our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a discount rate mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance 

 45 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2014 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the us pension plans with resulting changes to the expected longterm rate of return on assets the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 65  at december 31 2013 to 64  at december 31 2014 

another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate this rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate 

mortality assumptions for participants in our us pension plans incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the society of actuaries soa we periodically review the mortality experience of our us pension plans’ participants against these assumptions in the three months ended december 31 2014 the soa issued new mortality and mortality improvement tables that raise life expectancies and thereby indicate the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payments to our us pension plans participants is increasing we have incorporated the new soa mortality and mortality improvement tables into our december 31 2014 measurement of our us pension plans benefit obligations the change in these assumptions had the effect of increasing the december 31 2014 us pension plans obligations by 22 billion  

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial gain loss on our pension plans was 46 billion  and 14 billion  at december 31 2014 and 2013 the change is due primarily to the decrease in discount rates and the change in mortality assumptions partially offset by actual asset returns in excess of assumed returns 

the underfunded status of the us pension plans increased by 36 billion in the year ended december 31 2014 to 109 billion at december 31 2014 due primarily to 1 an unfavorable effect of 59 billion from a decrease in discount rates 2 an unfavorable effect of 22 billion from an increase in life expectancies resulting in an increase in the benefit obligations and 3 interest and service cost of 33 billion partially offset by 4 a favorable effect of 73 billion from actual returns on plan assets 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



pursuant to the labor contract with the uaw which expires in september 2015 a benefit unit represents the calculated pension payment associated with a specific benefit plan type the following data illustrates the sensitivity of changes in pension expense and pension obligation due to changes in future benefit units based on the last remeasurement of the us hourly pension plan at december 31 2014  dollars in millions 



we are subject to a variety of us federal rules and regulations which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our us pension plans certain of these rules and regulations allow plan sponsors funding relief for us pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates as a result utilizing current assumptions we expect no significant mandatory

contributions to our us qualified pension plans for the next five years we also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the us which are subject to local laws and regulations except for canada and the united kingdom most nonus pension laws and regulations do not have specific funding requirements 

refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions investment strategies and longterm rate of return weightedaverage discount rate the change in benefit obligation and related plan assets and future net benefit payments refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category 

valuation of deferred tax assets 

the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions or events could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets if law is enacted that reduces the us statutory rate we would record a significant reduction to the net deferred tax assets and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue and in certain instances as an increase to automotive cost of sales at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives 

policy product warranty and recall campaigns 

we have historically accrued estimated costs related to recall campaigns in gmna when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced during the three months ended june 30 2014 following the significant increase in the number of vehicles subject to recall in gmna the results of our ongoing comprehensive safety review additional engineering analysis the creation of a new global product integrity organization the appointment of a new global vice president of vehicle safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems and our overall commitment to customer satisfaction we accumulated sufficient historical data in gmna to support the use of an actuarialbased estimation technique for recall campaigns as such we now accrue at the time of vehicle sale in gmna the costs for recall campaigns in the three months ended june 30 2014 we recorded a catchup adjustment of 09 billion in automotive cost of sales to adjust the estimate for recall costs for previously sold vehicles the change in estimate was treated as an adjustment for ebitadjusted reporting purposes in the other regions there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarialbased estimation technique and the estimated costs will continue to be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced 

the estimates related to policy and product warranties are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models the 

 47 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event estimates contemplate the nature frequency and magnitude of historical events with consideration for changes in future expectations costs associated with campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost number of units impacted and the take rate depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from timetotime offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary we consider trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims 

in the six months ended june 30 2014 we recorded charges of 25 billion for recall campaigns and courtesy transportation that have been separately announced and 09 billion related to the catchup adjustment associated with a change in estimate the catchup adjustment and estimated amount accrued at the time of a vehicle sale for recall campaigns is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events the number of vehicles per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience we believe the amounts recorded are adequate to cover the costs of these recall campaigns a 10 increase in the estimated take rate for specifically announced recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately 02 billion 

actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the chief financial officer with support from the financial risk council which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the financial risk council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee and finance committee committees of the board of directors the audit committee and finance committee assist and guide the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the financial risk council our risk management policy intends to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations at december 31 2014  our most significant foreign currency exposures were the eurous dollar eurobritish pound us dollarsouth korean won and us dollarmexican peso derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2014  such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 23 months 

  

at december 31 2014  and 2013  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 09 billion  and 10 billion  this presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 02 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses dollars in millions 



interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities at december 31 2014  and 2013  we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2014  and 2013  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 98 billion  and 68 billion  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would be 04 billion  and 03 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  

at december 31 2014  and 2013  we had marketable securities of 80 billion  and 72 billion  classified as availableforsale and 13 billion  and 17 billion  classified as trading the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be insignificant at december 31 2014  and 2013

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between 1 interest earned on finance receivables and 2 interest paid on debt and could be affected by changes in interest rates typically consumer finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

 50 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of 38 billion  and 38 billion  and interest rate swaps and caps in liability positions with notional amounts of  74 billion  and  55 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations primarily those acquired from ally financial in 2013 into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

gm financials policy is to finance receivables and lease assets with debt in the same currency when a different currency is used gm financial typically uses foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings 

gm financial had foreign currency swaps in asset positions with notional amounts of 16 billion  and 17 billion  and in liability positions with notional amounts of 11 billion  and 21 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

product pricing 

several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2014 we will continue to price vehicles competitively including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices 

cyclical nature of business 

retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial ally financial inc ally financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters

our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption 

fuel efficiency 

we are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions and 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 

alternative fuel vehicles 

alternative fuels offer the greatest nearterm potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we currently offer 16 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2014 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we continue to study the future role flexfuel vehicles may play in the us in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure in 2013  94 of vehicle sales in brazil were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in australia thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace 

we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are cleanburning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels 

we produce cng bifuel capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira and in the us the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and cng we also produce the cng bifuel chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra 2500 hd pickup trucks that are available to both commercial and retail customers in addition we recently announced the offering of a cng bifuel chevrolet impala fullsize sedan to both fleet and retail markets starting in the summer of 2014 we offer lpg capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles 

we are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eassist plugin hybrid extended range and battery electric vehicles we currently offer 7 models in the us featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology phev and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt opel ampera and cadillac elr in 2013 we introduced the chevrolet spark ev and plan to invest heavily to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and inhouse development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries electric motors and power control systems 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated nearly 3 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology

product development 

our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization this strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development we define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces 

a centralized organization is responsible for many of the nonvisible parts of the vehicle such as steering suspension the brake system the heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system this team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand such as exterior and interior design tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements 

intellectual property 

we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials are primarily composed of steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10 to 11 of our total purchases from 2011 to 2013 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall emission and obd requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must 

 7 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world 

north america 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments canada’s federal government is aligned with the us federal requirements these requirements include vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and obd system requirements each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the us environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements fleetwide emissions compliance must also be achieved based on a salesweighted fleet average 

while we believe all our products are currently in compliance with epa and carb regulatory requirements both agencies have ongoing “inuse” evaluations of compliance for products from all manufacturers it is possible that we or either agency could identify potential noncompliance which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue testing is conducted at various times this includes preproduction testing of vehicles as part of certification and inuse testing of customer vehicles at specified mileages 

carb has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year these requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards the epa has proposed similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year these new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

california law requires that 12 of 2014 model year cars and certain lightduty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles zev such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial zev credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties additional portions of the zev requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial zev requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plugin hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria we are complying with the zev requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the zev and partial zev requirements carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals a portion of this requirement may be met with phevs that meet specified criteria including an extended emission system warranty 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements thirteen states as well as the province of quebec currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the zev requirements additional states could also adopt the california standards in the future 

vehicles equipped with heavyduty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements we also certify heavyduty engines for installation in other manufacturers products we are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by epa and carb regulations we are meeting obd requirements for heavyduty vehicles with certain hardware and software changes 

in mexico we must obtain model year certification from the federal environmental protection agency for each engine family and vehicle line before we can sell vehicles stringent lightduty vehicle emission requirements applicable to vehicles sold in mexico are enforced starting 18 months after nationwide availability of ultra low sulfur fuels emission requirements applicable to medium and heavyduty trucks powered by gasoline cng or lpg were upgraded in 2012 stringent emission requirements applicable to medium and heavyduty trucks powered by diesel have been proposed but no enforcement date has been established yet 

regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases are discussed under “automotive fuel economy” since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of a fuel economy requirement 

europe

general motors company and subsidiaries 

emissions are regulated by two different entities the european commission ec and the united nations economic commission for europe unece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 european union eu member states and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the unece we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the eu member states type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program eu and unece requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation 

a new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 5 was effective in 2011 future european emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles the euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2017 the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet us emission standards these technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging european market for small and midsize diesel vehicles gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements the measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

in the longterm notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in europe the ec will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd

corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks beginning with the 2011 model year both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2014 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 338 mpg our import car standard is estimated at 372 mpg and our lightduty truck standard is estimated to be 245 mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program 

in august 2012 the epa and the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa finalized a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year lightduty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy this regulation represents a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year lightduty vehicles this program includes epa and nhtsa standards that will require an industrywide standard by 2016 our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016 

the carb regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles which is the same as regulating fuel economy this california program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2016 model years 

a canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with us standards beginning with the 2011 model year however these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles the province of quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the california program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year

legislation regulating fleet average co 2  emissions was implemented for passenger cars in 2012 based on a target function of co 2  to vehicle weight each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific salesweighted fleet average target the fleet average requirement began phasing in during 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 automobile manufacturers can earn supercredits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific co 2  value this is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultralow co 2  vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the co 2  fleet average automobile manufacturers may gain credit for ecoinnovations for those technologies which improve realworld fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle such as solar panels on vehicles there is also a 5 credit for flexfuel vehicles if more than 30 of refueling stations in an eu member state sell e85 further regulatory detail is being developed the legislation sets a target for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement we are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in 2011 the eu adopted a standard to regulate co 2  emissions from light commercial vehicles this regulation is modeled after the co 2  regulation for passenger cars it proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average co 2  target with a phasein of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016 the manufacturerspecific co 2  compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel vehicle curb weight flexibilities such as ecoinnovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well an eu longterm target for 2020 has been adopted for light commercial vehicles we have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in july 2012 the eu commission released a regulatory proposal outlining the regulatory implementation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles targets effective in 2020 implementation of the target has been delayed with final release expected in early 2014 while the passenger car target is expected to remain in place beginning in 2020 in that first year 2020 only 95 of the original equipment manufacturers oems fleet is required to comply full 100 compliance will be required in 2021 the individual manufacturer targets will continue to be determined based on the average vehicle mass other compliance flexibilities will be limited adding additional challenges to compliance with the co 2  fleet target 

effective in november 2012 an ec regulation required lowrolling resistance tires tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators which we adopted in 2011 an additional ec regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise fuel efficiency and rolling resistance affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket

in saudi arabia the government is developing a footprintbased fuel economy standard modeled on the us system which would likely commence in 2016 using the us target value curves from 2011 or 2012 the saudi program is not expected to include the alternative fueladvanced technology vehicle and other credits from the us program 

in india the government is developing a weightbased co 2 fuel efficiency regulation that is likely to be implemented in 2017 it is expected that the regulatory standards could be similar but less stringent than levels required in the eu with tighter standards planned for 2022 

in australia the current governments agenda no longer includes the adoption of attributebased co 2 standards 

south america 

in brazil the government has set new fuel economy requirements called inovar auto oems have mandatory fleet average compliance required by october 2017 with a reduction from 2012 levels the brazilian government provides indirect tax incentives to eligible participant companies that meet certain requirements including these energy efficiency targets the level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the degree and timing to which the targets are met participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and specific fines 

in chile every new passenger vehicle up to a certain vehicle weight is required to be tested under euro procedure in order to determine its reference values to be included in the new mandatory fuel economy label as a result of this process the label indicates the fuel consumption values for city highway and combined cityhighway and the co 2  emission values 

chemical regulations 

we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

  

north america 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives green chemistry life cycle assessment and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle lifecycle including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity 

in california two chemical initiatives will become effective in 2014 the brake pad reformulation law and the safer consumer products regulations the brake pad reformulation law requires brake and vehicle manufacturers to ensure brakes produced after january 2014 meet limits for the amounts of certain heavy metals and are properly certified and labeled under the safer consumer products regulation california epa will begin regulating specific consumer products that contain chemicals of concern it is not yet known when vehicle components will be targeted 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements eu reach regulation to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 during the preregistration phase old gm and its suppliers registered those substances identified by this regulation it is to be phasedin over a 10year period under this regulation “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements 

safety 

 12 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the us if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than us standards many countries require type approval while the us and canada require selfcertification 

vehicular noise control 

in the us passenger cars and lightduty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations we identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements medium to heavyduty trucks are regulated at the federal level federal truck regulations preempt all us state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10000 lbs 

outside the us noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level eg ec or unece we believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold the ec has proposed new noise regulations that would mandate a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions these proposals are coupled with a new test procedure to better estimate the actual inuse noise emission of vehicles the proposals of the ec also form the basis for amendment to unece vehicle regulations with the expected effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of north america at this point the final noise emission levels as well as the implementation timing of the final regulations are uncertain 

while current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels these proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles specifically hybrids and electrics may not be readily heard by pedestrians in the us nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on january 14 2013 and the us department of transportation indicated a final rule is expected to be published in 2015 the unece is developing a global technical regulation sponsored by the us japan and the eu for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels 

we are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals 

potential effect of regulations 

we are actively working on aggressive nearterm and longterm plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities improve fuel efficiency monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers this is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of flexfuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles the conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfillfree status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability we believe that the development and global implementation of new costeffective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities 

despite these advanced technology efforts our ability to satisfy fuel economy co 2 and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic consumer legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements which include higher cafe standards and state co 2 requirements such as those which require the carb to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products negotiated remedial actions possible fines or a combination of any of those items we must also cover the cost of repairs conducted under emission defect and performance warranties which apply for specified periods of time and mileage in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue

pension legislation 

we are subject to a variety of us federal rules and regulations including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended and the pension protection act of 2006 which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans in july 2012 the us government enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for us pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates under current economic conditions we expect the new law to further delay required contributions to our us pension plans the new law does not impact our reported funded status 

export control 

we are subject to us export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls our office of export compliance and our global export compliance officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 

automotive financing  gm financial 

gm financial is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992 gm financial conducts its business in north america and as a result of the 2013 acquisition of the ally financial international operations in europe and latin america gm financial expects to complete in 2014 the acquisition of ally financials equity interest in gmacsaic automotive finance company limited gmacsaic that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in china 

gm financial automobile finance programs in north america include subprime lending and full spectrum leasing the subprime lending programs predominantly offer financing to consumers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions the typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700 since gm financial provides financing in a relatively highrisk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing the full spectrum leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and targets prime and subprime consumers leasing new vehicles gm financial seeks to provide competitive alternatives to existing marketplace lease offerings in our franchised dealers gm financial services its loan and lease portfolio at regional centers using automated servicing and collection systems 

in april 2012 and march 2013 gm financial launched the us and canadian commercial lending platforms to further support our franchised dealerships and their affiliates these platforms are centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites facilities facility improvements and working capital these loans are made on a secured basis 

gm financial’s international consumer lending programs focus on financing prime quality consumers purchasing our new and used vehicles in many countries gm financial also offers financial leases a leaseretail hybrid product that includes a balloon payment at expiration and financerelated insurance products through third parties such as credit life gap and extended warranty coverage commercial products offered to dealer customers include new and used vehicle inventory financing inventory insurance working capital and capital improvement loans other commercial products include fleet financing and storage center financing 

gm financial primarily finances its loan lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured bank lines through public and private securitization transactions where such markets are developed and to a lesser extent in latin america through public financing programs including the issuance of commercial paper and other financing programs 

gm financial retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by gm financial over the life of the securitization excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the assetbacked securities net of credit losses and expenses 

excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to gm financial in addition to excess cash flows gm financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our business is highly dependent on sales volume there is no assurance that the global automobile market will not suffer a significant downturn 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment the availability of credit fluctuations in the cost of fuel and consumer confidence we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty and any change in economic and market conditions that negatively affects sales volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle the automotive industry particularly in the us is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and changing any negative perception in light of old gms bankruptcy will be critical to our longterm profitability we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2014 a successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our short term profitability 

the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers there can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we are unable to achieve these goals we may not be able to maintain profitability over the longterm 

shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand 

volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which provide lower profit margins any increases in the price of oil in the us or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of political instability in the middle east south america and african nations could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles which could reduce our market share in affected markets decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 17 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

our automotive manufacturing operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to provide us with systems components and parts and any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule and adversely affect our operations 

our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes results in our having minimal inventories of the systems components and parts we need to conduct our automotive manufacturing operations as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of systems components and parts at such times as allow us to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely and thus could adversely affect our financial results 

increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business including steel nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper and precious metals such as platinum and palladium the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices some of these raw materials such as corrosionresistant steel are only available from a limited number of suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances 

designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale we believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances which could adversely affect 

 18 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our competitiveness with respect to those competitors competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position which could also materially adversely affect our business 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries but we may not succeed in doing so and our failure to restructure these operations in a costeffective and nondisruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in 2013 the european automotive industry continued to be severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity 

in response we are executing various actions to strengthen our european operations and increase our competitiveness the key areas of the plan include 

 

notwithstanding the above we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the european automotive industry will not improve significantly in the shortterm and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result in addition the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated as well as external factors which are outside of our control our inability to successfully restructure our european operations and implement our plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns 

our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market capacity to absorb a particular investment strategy or high volume transactions and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirement for our us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns as other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements are described in “managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities” 

factors which affect future funding requirements for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds which would negatively affect our cash flow 

we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing prime and subprime financing to consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

in north america gm financial supports additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring subprime vehicle financing as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers in europe and south america we rely on gm financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to 

 19 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

prime consumers as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers  gm financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing prime and subprime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles and commercial lending to our dealers because we rely on gm financial to serve as an additional source of leasing prime and subprime financing options for consumers and commercial lending to our dealers any impairment of gm financials ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among consumers who rely on these financial services to acquire new vehicles and dealers who seek financing the factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and impair its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the above factors alone or in combination could negatively affect gm financials business and operations or its ability to provide leasing prime and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles and dealer financing 

our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and even if funded at anticipated levels may not result in successful vehicle applications 

we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2014 and 2015 largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate we may be forced to reduce delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology 

in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers there can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies however our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information 

we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain management manufacturing invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of gm financial additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our 

 20 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

networks and systems or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions or changes in existing ones may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future in the us and europe for example governmental regulation is driven primarily by concerns about the environment including greenhouse gas emissions vehicle safety fuel economy and energy security these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs including civil penalties they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue 

in the us vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the nhtsa and the epa the agencies have set coordinated fuel economy and greenhouse emission standards through the 2025 model year for light duty vehicles and through the 2018 model year for heavy duty trucks california which has set its own greenhouse gas emission standards through its ab 1493 rules has agreed to accept compliance with the national program as compliance with its state program 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding these us regulatory requirements and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated national program through the 2021 model year the standards for the 2022 through 2025 model years may be adjusted as a result of a midterm review by the agencies therefore we believe it is premature to project compliance with possible standards for those years we expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

the eu passed legislation effective in april 2009 that began regulating vehicle co 2  emissions in 2012 the legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020 with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells additional measures have been proposed or adopted in europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance vehicle air conditioners tire pressure monitors gear shift indicators and others at the national level 17 eu member states have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxidebased vehicle taxation system which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the eu emissions standards 

other governments around the world such as canada china brazil mexico and south korea are also creating or have new policies to address these same issues as in the us these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance the regulations will result in substantial costs which could be difficult to pass through to our customers and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which could affect our operations including facility closings reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations particularly in emerging markets are carried out by joint ventures such as sgm in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our coowners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefits 

 21 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which can have material adverse effects on our business in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the us into us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date as a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business 

the majority of our vehicles are sold outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the effects of these risks may individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our business 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards or changes in existing ones may have a significant negative effect on how we do business 

our products must satisfy legal safety requirements meeting or exceeding governmentmandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards while we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to 

 22 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

reduce costs and lead times unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development testing and manufacturing governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

from time to time we recall our products to address performance compliance or safetyrelated issues the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above

gm korea wage litigation 

commencing on or about september 29 2010 current and former hourly employees of gm korea filed eight separate group actions in the incheon district court in incheon korea the cases which in aggregate involve more than 10000 employees allege that gm korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of ordinary wages due under the presidential decree of the korean labor standards act on november 23 2012 the seoul high court an intermediate level appellate court issued a decision affirming a decision of the incheon district court in a case involving five gm korea employees which was contrary to gm koreas position gm korea appealed to the supreme court of the republic of korea supreme court and initiated a constitutional challenge to the adverse interpretation of the relevant statute in december 2013 the supreme court rendered a decision in a case involving another company not affiliated with us which addressed many of the issues presented in the cases pending against gm korea and resolved many of them in a manner which we believe is favorable to gm korea in particular while the supreme court held that fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of ordinary wages it also held that claims for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstances we believe the supreme court’s reasoning is applicable to gm korea even though gm korea’s case remains pending before the supreme court accordingly we have eliminated the accrual associated with these cases

reconciliation of consolidated automotive and gm financial segment results 

nongaap measures 

management believes earnings before interest and tax ebitadjusted provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments operating results because it excludes interest income interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments such adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill other longlived assets under certain circumstances and certain investments gains or losses on the settlementextinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of noncore investments 

management believes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the liquidity of our automotive operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow above those required in our business to sustain our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures we measure adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans 

management believes these measures allow it to readily view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions we believe these nongaap measures are useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and are therefore used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking management does not consider the excluded items when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources such as capital investment among business units and for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes 

while management believes that these nongaap measures provide useful information they are not operating measures under us gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nongaap measures has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as net income net income attributable to stockholders or operating cash flow due to these limitations these nongaap measures are used as supplements to us gaap measures 

management believes income before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding gm financials operating results gm financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment 

the following tables summarize the reconciliation of our automotive segments ebitadjusted and gm financials income before income taxes to net income attributable to stockholders and provides supplemental detail of the adjustments which are presented net of noncontrolling interests dollars in millions

venezuelan operations 

our venezuelan subsidiaries functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy 

effective february 13 2013 the venezuelan government set the official fixed exchange rate of the bolivar fuerte bsf at bsf 63 to 100 from bsf 43 to 100 the devaluation resulted in a charge of 02 billion  in the three months ended march 31 2013 from the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities   we believe it is possible that the venezuelan government may further devalue the bsf against the us dollar in the future if the bsf were devalued further it would result in a charge to our income statement in the period of devaluation based on our december 31 2013 net monetary assets a charge of approximately 01 billion would result for every 10 devaluation of the bsf 

in december 2013 a new decree became effective requiring the government of venezuela to set prices for all vehicles parts and accessories sold in the country in addition the venezuelan government has foreign exchange control regulations that make it difficult to convert bsf to us dollars which affect our venezuelan subsidiaries’ ability to pay nonbsf denominated obligations and to pay dividends in january 2014 the venezuelan government announced changes to the foreign exchange process which could affect the rate at which our venezuelan subsidiaries buy dollars these regulations when considered with other governmental policies impacting labor force reductions and other circumstances in venezuela may limit our ability to fully benefit from and maintain our controlling financial interest in our venezuelan subsidiaries the financial impact on our operations in venezuela of these events and associated ongoing restrictions are uncertain 

the total amounts pending government approval for settlement in us dollar at december 31 2013 and 2012 were bsf 37 billion equivalent to 06 billion and bsf 22 billion equivalent to 05 billion these amounts include requests in the amount of bsf 06 billion equivalent to 01 billion that have been pending from 2007 our venezuelan subsidiaries net assets were 09 billion at december 31 2013 including net monetary assets of 10 billion at december 31 2013 other consolidated entities had receivables from our venezuelan subsidiaries denominated in other currencies of 05 billion

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity overview 

we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our secured revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs however we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations our future uses of cash which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors are centered around three objectives 1 reinvest in our business 2 continue to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position and 3 return cash to shareholders our known future material uses of cash include among other possible demands 1 capital expenditures of approximately 75 billion  annually as well as engineering and product development activities 2 acquiring ally financials equity interests in gmacsaic as subsequently discussed for approximately 09 billion  3 payments for previously announced restructuring activities of up to 11 billion 4 payments to service debt and other longterm obligations 5 payments to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock with a liquidation amount of 39 billion  once the shares become redeemable on or after december 31 2014 and 6 dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors 

our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those described in the “risk factors” section of this 2013 form 10k some of which are outside our control macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans 

recent management initiatives 

we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position over the longterm these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our longterm obligations while maintaining minimal financial leverage as well as the possibility of acquisitions dispositions and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business these actions may include additional loans investments with our joint venture partners or the acquisitions of certain operations or ownership stakes in outside businesses these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the shortterm

we made a voluntary contribution in january 2011 to our us hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of 61 million shares of our common stock valued at 22 billion for funding purposes at the time of contribution the contributed shares qualified as a plan asset for funding purposes at the time of contribution and as a plan asset valued at 19 billion for accounting purposes in july 2011 this was a voluntary contribution above our funding requirements for the pension plans 

the following table summarizes the underfunded status of pension plans on a us gaap basis dollars in millions 



the decrease in underfunded status of the us pension plans was due primarily to 1 actuarial gains due primarily to discount rate increases of 77 billion 2 actual return on plan assets of 21 billion and 3 contributions of 01 billion partially offset by 4 service and interest costs of 31 billion 

the decrease in underfunded status of the nonus pension plans primarily in canada the united kingdom and germany was due primarily to 1 actuarial gains due primarily to discount rate increases of 10 billion 2 actual return on plan assets of 10 billion and 3 contributions and benefit payments of 09 billion partially offset by 4 service and interest costs of 14 billion 5 net unfavorable foreign currency effect of 02 billion and 6 business combinations of 01 billion 

hourly and salaried opeb plans provide postretirement life insurance to certain us retirees and eligible dependents and postretirement health coverage to some us retirees and eligible dependents certain of the nonus subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans although most participants are covered by government sponsored or administered programs

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013  and 2012  

guarantees provided to third parties 

we have provided guarantees related to the residual value of operating leases certain suppliers commitments certain productrelated claims and third party commercial loans and other obligations the maximum potential obligation under these commitments was 169 billion  and 235 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012  

refer to note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees we have provided 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities 

the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities at december 31 2013  dollars in millions

the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 25 billion  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts 

pension funding requirements 

we have implemented and completed a balance sheet derisking strategy comprising certain actions related to our us salaried pension plan these actions included payment of lumpsums to retirees the purchase of group annuity contracts from an insurance company and the settlement of other previously guaranteed obligations 

we do not have any required contributions payable to our us qualified plans in 2014 we expect to contribute 01 billion  to our us nonqualified plans and 07 billion  to our nonus pension plans in 2014 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however due to inherent uncertainties in 

 54 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods we have discussed the development selection and disclosures of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to these estimates 

pensions 

the defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2013 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the us pension plans with resulting changes to the expected longterm rate of return on assets the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets increased from 58  at december 31 2012 to 65  at december 31 2013 due primarily to higher yields on fixed income securities 

another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations we estimate this rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods the unamortized pretax actuarial gain loss on our pension plans was 14 billion and 62 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 the change is due primarily to the increase in discount rates 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 



the following data illustrates the sensitivity of changes in pension expense and pension obligation based on the last remeasurement of the us hourly pension plan at december 31 2013  dollars in millions 



refer to note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for the expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on plan assets weightedaverage discount rate on plan obligations and actual and expected return on plan assets refer to note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category 

valuation of deferred tax assets 

 55 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we evaluate the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances based on a more likely than not standard the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction it is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years we utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events or otherwise could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations at december 31 2013 we retained valuation allowances of 108 billion  against deferred tax assets primarily in gme and south korea business units with losses and in the us and canada related primarily to capital loss tax attributes and state operating loss carryforwards 

if law is enacted that reduces the us statutory rate we would record a significant reduction to the net deferred tax assets and a related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 

impairment of goodwill 

when applying freshstart reporting certain accounts primarily employee benefit and income tax related were recorded at amounts determined under specific us gaap rather than fair value and the difference between the us gaap and fair value amounts gave rise to goodwill which is a residual if all identifiable assets and liabilities had been recorded at fair value upon application of freshstart reporting no goodwill would have resulted goodwill established at freshstart was 305 billion of which 304 billion  has been impaired through december 31 2013 

in the three months ended december 31 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 for all reporting units with goodwill our reporting units are gmna gme and various reporting units within the gmio gmsa and gm financial segments in the year ended december 31 2013 we also performed eventdriven goodwill impairment tests at various dates for certain of our reporting units based on our testing procedures we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 05 billion  in the year ended december 31 2013 primarily associated with our gm korea and gm india reporting units subsequent to the recording of the goodwill impairment charges in the year ended december 31 2013 we had goodwill of 16 billion  at december 31 2013 which resulted primarily from the acquisition of americredit corp in 2011 

refer to note 10  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairments 

for purposes of our 2013 annual impairment testing procedures at october 1 2013 the estimated fair value of gm financial’s north american reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 29 due to anticipated changes in gm financials business model to continue to introduce higher credit quality products into its lending portfolio the initial equity retention ratio assumption of 125 was forecasted to decrease to 75 by 2018 in the discounted cash flow analysis utilized for goodwill impairment testing purposes having higher credit quality products comprising a larger percentage of gm financials lending portfolio will require less equity gm koreas fair value continued to be below its carrying amount and gm india’s carrying amount became negative 

the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair valuetous gaap differences giving rise to the implied goodwill for the reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis are 1 the determination of our nonperformance risk 2 interest rates 3 estimates of our employee benefit related obligations and 4 the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets including our determination whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized for the year ended december 31 2013 gm koreas goodwill assessment was most sensitive to our determination of estimates of our employee benefit related obligations and gm india’s was most sensitive to the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets 

impairment of longlived assets 

the carrying amount of longlived assets and finitelived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant if the carrying amount of a longlived asset group is considered impaired a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for the longlived assets or in certain cases the asset group to be held and used productspecific longlived asset groups are tested for impairment at the platform or vehicle line level nonproductspecific longlived assets are tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis in gmna and gme and tested at or within our various reporting units within our gmio gmsa and gm financial segments 

in december 2013 we 1 announced our plans to cease mainstream distribution of chevrolet brand in western and central europe in 2015 due to the challenging business model and difficult economic situation in europe 2 announced plans to cease manufacturing at holden by the end of 2017 and 3 performed a strategic assessment of gm india in response to lower than 

 56 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

expected sales performance of our current product offerings in india higher raw material costs unfavorable foreign exchange rates and recent deterioration in local market conditions these triggered longlived asset impairment analyses so we performed recoverability tests on the longlived assets associated with these asset groups our tests concluded that the associated longlived assets were not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying amounts we develop anticipated cash flows from historical experience and internal business plans 

we estimated the fair values of the associated longlived assets to determine the impairment amount fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved a considerable amount of management judgment was required in determining the fair value of the asset groups which requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions considered to be level 3 inputs an inexchange premise was determined to be the highest and best use of the assets which is different than the assets current use due to 1 expected losses to be incurred associated with the exit of chevrolet from a mainstream presence in western and central europe and the wind down of manufacturing activities at holden and 2 the lack of economic support due to declining operations for the existing longlived assets at gm india as a result in the three months ended december 31 2013 we recorded total asset impairment charges of 11 billion in gmio refer to notes 9  and 11  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impairment charges recorded and related fair value measurements 

while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets could become impaired in the future as a result of declines in profitability due to significant changes in volume pricing or costs 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue and in certain instances as an increase to automotive cost of sales at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives 

policy product warranty and recall campaigns 

the estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events however where little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

automotive 

we enter into a variety of foreign currency exchange and commodity forward contracts and options to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the risk management committee which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the risk management committee comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee a committee of the board of directors the audit committee assists and guides the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the risk management committee our risk management policy intends to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations at december 31 2013  our most significant foreign currency exposures were the eurobritish pound us dollarkorean won eurokorean won and eurous dollar derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2013  such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 23 months 

  

at december 31 2013  and 2012  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 10 billion  and 40 billion  this presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 195 million  and 671 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses dollars in millions

interest rate risk 



we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities at december 31 2013  we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at december 31 2013  and 2012  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 68 billion  and 53 billion  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would be 251 million  and 112 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  

at december 31 2013  and 2012  we had marketable securities of 72 billion  and 38 billion  classified as availablefor sale and 17 billion and 52 billion classified as trading the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be insignificant at december 31 2013  and 2012  

automotive financing  gm financial 

fluctuations in market interest rates can affect gm financials secured and unsecured debt gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between 1 interest earned on finance receivables other income and lease contracts and 2 interest paid is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of gm financials dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund purchases of finance receivables and leased vehicles 

credit facilities 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

securitizations 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of 38 billion  and 08 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012  gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in liability positions with notional amounts of 55 billion  and 08 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations primarily those acquired from ally financial at various dates in 2013 into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect gm financials financial condition 

in connection with the closing of certain acquisitions of ally financials international operations gm financial provided loans denominated in foreign currencies euro british pound and swedish krona to acquired entities that had an equivalent balance of 17 billion at december 31 2013 gm financial purchased foreign exchange swaps to offset any valuation change in the loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates the fair value of these foreign exchange swaps was insignificant

product pricing 

several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2013 we will continue to price vehicles competitively including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices 

cyclical nature of business 

retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 



we enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial ally financial inc ally financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product development and intellectual property 

costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers 

the following table summarizes research and development expense dollars in millions 



our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption 

fuel efficiency 

we are fully committed to meeting the requirements of the energy independence and security act of 2007 and compliance with other regulatory schemes we plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 4 increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings and 5 portfolio changes including increasing carcrossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller more fuel efficient offerings 

alternative fuel vehicles 

alternative fuels offer the greatest nearterm potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flexfuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

we currently offer 21 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2013 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we continue to study the future role flexfuel vehicles may play in the us in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure in 2012  95 of vehicle sales in brazil were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in australia thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace 

we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are cleanburning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels 

we produce cng bifuel capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira and in the us the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and cng in november 2012 we began production of the cng bifuel chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra 2500 hd pickup trucks 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

that are available to both commercial and retail customers we offer lpg capable vehicles in select markets in europe asia pacific south america and north america reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles 

we are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eassist plugin hybrid extended range and battery electric vehicles we currently offer 12 hybrid models and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology phev and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera in 2013 we plan to produce the chevrolet spark pure electric vehicle and plan to invest heavily to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and inhouse development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries electric motors and power control systems 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway have accumulated more than 25 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies these programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology 

onstar 

onstar llc onstar is a whollyowned subsidiary of gm serving more than 63 million subscribers in the us and canada and through a joint venture china onstar is a provider of connected safety security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2013 model year vehicles onstars key services include automatic crash response stolen vehicle assistance remote door unlock turnbyturn navigation vehicle diagnostics and handsfree calling 

in recent years onstar has developed a system based on the findings of a center for disease control and prevention expert panel which allows onstar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants onstar also launched a mobile application leveraging onstars unique connection to the vehicle to provide onstar subscribers with uptodate vehicle information such as oil level tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start remote door unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone 

product development 

our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization this strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development we define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces 

a centralized organization is responsible for many of the nonvisible parts of the vehicle such as steering suspension the brake system the heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system this team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand such as exterior and interior design tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements 

intellectual property 

we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials are primarily composed of steel aluminum resins copper 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10 to 11 of our total purchases from 2010 to 2012 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic obd system requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall emission and obd requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world 

north america 

the federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments these requirements include preproduction testing of vehicles testing of vehicles after assembly the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements we must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the united states environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

we believe that our vehicles meet the current epa and carb requirements if our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing or as part of government required defect reporting we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls and possible fines we expect that new carb and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

fleetwide compliance with current epa and carb emission standards must be achieved based on a salesweighted fleet average carb has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year these requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards the epa is also developing similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year both the epa and the carb have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement they are discussed under “automotive fuel economy” 

california law requires that 12 of 2013 model year cars and certain lightduty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles zev such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial zev credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties additional portions of the zev requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial zev requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plugin hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria we are complying with the zev requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the partial zev requirements carb has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals a portion of this requirement may be met with phevs that meet specified criteria including an extended emission system warranty 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements twelve states as well as the province of quebec currently have these standards in effect one state has adopted those standards beginning in the 2014 model year and additional states could also adopt the california standards in the future 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

vehicles equipped with heavyduty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements and could be recalled or fines could be imposed against us should testing or defect reporting identify noncompliance with emission requirements we also certify heavyduty engines for installation in other manufacturers products the heavyduty exhaust standards became more stringent in the 2010 model year we are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by epa and carb regulations obd requirements were first applied to heavyduty vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes 

europe 

emissions are regulated by two different entities the european commission ec and the united nations economic commission for europe unece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 european union eu member states and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the unece eu member states can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the eu member states type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program eu and unece requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation 

a new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 5 was effective in 2011 future european emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles the new euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2014 the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet us emission standards these technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging european market for small and midsize diesel vehicles gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements the measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

the adoption of additional requirements of euro 6 has been extended by the ec to 2017 in the longterm notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in europe the ec will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd 

international operations 

china has implemented euro 4 standards with european obd requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles beijing is expected to require many elements of euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles beginning in 2013 with additional elements of euro 5 standards to be enforced beginning in 2014 nationwide implementation of euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017 for dieselpowered vehicles china has implemented euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both lightduty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavyduty diesel vehicles enforcement of euro 4 standards for new diesel lightduty registrations has been delayed until 2013 

south korea has implemented the euro 5 emission standards with european obd requirements for dieselpowered vehicles and the carb standards for gasolinelpgpowered vehicles commencing in 2014 new typeapprovals will require the vehicle to meet euro 6 diesel standards the government is also considering the introduction of amendments to the lowemission vehicle program leviii of the carb standards for gasolinelpgpowered vehicles with the planned implementation in 2016 

south america 

certain countries follow the us test procedures standards and obd requirements and others follow the eu test procedures standards and obd requirements with different levels of stringency brazil implemented national l5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009 l6 standards for light diesel vehicles were implemented in 2012 and mandate obd installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015 l6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models argentina implemented euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2012 to 2014 for new vehicles and from 2014 to 2016 for all vehicles chile has enforced euro 5 or us tier 2 bin 5 emission standards for diesel vehicles and will implement euro 5 or us tier 2 bin 5 standards for gasoline vehicles in september 2014

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions water discharges waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

the future effect of environmental matters including potential liabilities is often difficult to estimate at december 31 2012  our accruals for environmental liabilities were 166 million  which is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites remediation periods typically range from five to 30 years 

site remediation 

the following table summarizes the expenditures for siteremediation actions including ongoing operations and maintenance dollars in millions 



it is possible that such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of 30 million over the next five years 

however currently unidentified remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be determined with specificity because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site the involvement of other potentially responsible parties the application of laws and other standards or regulations site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations studies and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent duration and success of remediation as a result we are unable to determine with specificity the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites although that total could be substantial 

facility management 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfillfree facilities at december 31 2012 84 or over 50 of our manufacturing facilities were landfillfree facilities additionally we have 20 nonmanufacturing facilities that are landfill free at our landfillfree facilities approximately 97 of waste materials are recycled or reused and 3 is converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities including construction demolition and remediation wastes we estimate that we recycled or reused over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 61000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at wastetoenergy facilities in the year ended december 31 2012 

we continue to make progress on our 2020 manufacturing commitment to reduce total waste on a kgvehicle basis by 10 having reduced total waste by over 15 kgvehicle in 2012 from our 2010 baseline exclusive of metals and foundryrelated wastes and more than a 30 kgvehicle reduction including metals and foundryrelated wastes 

in addition to providing environmental benefits our landfillfree program and total waste reduction commitments help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal 

we continue to implement our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our green power purchases and improve our energy efficiency our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related co 2  emissions including collecting and verifying energy water and other environmental data from our facilities our approach to manage our greenhouse gas emissions includes a global process to collect accurate data internal and external targets and publicly reporting progress against the established targets

corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks beginning with the 2011 model year both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2012  our domestic car standard was estimated to be 323 mpg and our lightduty truck standard was estimated to be 238 mpg we do not have an import car fleet for 2012 our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program 

in august 2012 the epa and the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa finalized a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year lightduty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy this regulation represents a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year lightduty vehicles this program includes epa and nhtsa standards that will require an industrywide target standard of 250 grams of carbonrelated exhaust emissions per mile and 341 mpg by 2016 our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016 

the carb regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles which is the same as regulating fuel economy this california program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2016 model years 

a canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with us standards beginning with the 2011 model year however these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles 

the province of quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the california program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year 

europe 

legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle co 2  emissions which began in 2012 based on a target function of co 2  to vehicle weight each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific salesweighted fleet average target this fleet average requirement began phasing in during 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 automobile manufacturers can earn supercredits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific co 2  value of less than 50 grams co 2  per kilometer this is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultralow co 2  vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the co 2  fleet average automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for ecoinnovations for those technologies which improve realworld fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle such as solar panels on vehicles there is also a 5 credit for flexfuel vehicles if more than 30 of refueling stations in an eu member state sell e85 further regulatory detail is being developed the legislation sets a target of 95 grams co 2 per kilometer for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement we are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in 2011 the eu adopted a standard to regulate co 2  emissions from light commercial vehicles this regulation is modeled after the co 2  regulation for passenger cars it proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average co 2  target of 175 grams co 2 per kilometer with a phase in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016 the manufacturerspecific co 2  compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel vehicle curb weight flexibilities such as ecoinnovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well an eu longterm target for 2020 of 147 grams co 2  per kilometer has been adopted for light commercial vehicles we have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in july 2012 the eu commission released a regulatory proposal outlining the regulatory implementation of the 95gkm passenger cars and 147gkm light commercial vehicles targets effective in 2020 the individual manufacturer targets will continue to be determined based on the average vehicle mass other compliance flexibilities have been limited adding additional challenges to compliance with the co 2  fleet target we are assessing the impacts of limited flexibilities on our compliance plan we are involved in the debate as the political discussion unfolds

we face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries china has established new phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current phase 2 passfail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years implementation began in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 china has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles extended range and plugin battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china is now working on a more aggressive phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years 

in korea fuel economyco 2  targets for 2012 through 2015 were implemented as part of the governments low carbongreen growth strategy these targets are based on each vehicles curb weight and in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy targets in the us but less stringent than co 2  targets in the eu the targets began being phased in during 2012 with full compliance by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify based on either fuel consumption or co 2  emissions each manufacturer has been given a corporate target to meet based on its overall industry fleet fuel economyco 2  average gm koreas current product portfolio is expected to comply with the targets by 2015 however in 2013 the korean government plans to set more stringent fuel economy targets for 2016 and beyond that will likely reach the level in japan by 2020 and the level in the eu by 2025 

in australia the government is planning to adopt attributebased co 2  standards beginning in 2015 with standards expected to become more stringent through 2020 

south america 

in brazil governmental bodies and the automobile manufacturers association established a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles equipped with internal combustion gasoline engines this voluntary program aims to increase vehicle energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban extraurban and combined equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements in the us driving conditions 

in october 2012 the brazilian government issued a decree which will provide indirect tax incentives beginning january 1 2013 to eligible participant companies that meet certain energy efficiency targets the level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the degree and timing to which the targets are met to the extent targets are not met penalties and interest will be levied and no indirect tax incentives will be available 

in chile starting in february 2013 every new vehicle with no more than eight seats is required to be tested in order to determine its reference values to be included in the new mandatory fuel economy label as a result of this process the label indicates the fuel consumption values for city highway and combined cityhighway and the co 2  emission values 

chemical regulations 

north america 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives green chemistry life cycle assessment and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle lifecycle including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements eu reach regulation to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu in quantities 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 during the preregistration phase old gm and its suppliers registered those substances identified by this regulation it is to be phasedin over a 10year period under this regulation “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements 

  we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business suppliers and the automotive industry 

  

  safety 

in the us if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than us standards many countries require type approval while the us and canada require selfcertification 

vehicular noise control 

in the us passenger cars and lightduty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations we identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements medium to heavyduty trucks are regulated at the federal level federal truck regulations preempt all us state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10000 lbs 

outside the us noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level eg ec or unece we believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold the ec has proposed new noise regulations that would mandate a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions these proposals are coupled with a new test procedure to better estimate the actual inuse noise emission of vehicles the proposals of the ec also form the basis for amendment to unece vehicle regulations with the expected effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of north america at this point the final noise emission levels as well as the implementation timing of the final regulations are uncertain 

while current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels these proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles specifically hybrids and electrics may not be readily heard by pedestrians in the united states nhtsa has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on january 14 2013 and is required to issue a final regulation for the minimum level of sound for hybrid and electric vehicles by january 2014 the unece is developing a global technical regulation sponsored by the united states japan and the eu for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels 

we are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals 

potential effect of regulations 

we are actively working on aggressive nearterm and longterm plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities improve fuel efficiency monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers this is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of flexfuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles the conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfillfree status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability we believe that the development and global implementation of new costeffective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency

despite these advanced technology efforts our ability to satisfy fuel economy co 2 and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic consumer legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements which include higher cafe standards and state co 2 requirements such as those which require the carb to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

pension legislation 

we are subject to a variety of us federal rules and regulations including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended and the pension protection act of 2006 which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans in july 2012 the us government enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for us pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates as a result under current economic conditions we expect the new law to further delay required contributions to our us pension plans the new law does not impact our reported funded status or funding contemplated under our derisking initiatives 

export control 

we are subject to us export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls our office of export compliance and our global export compliance officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 

automotive financing  gm financial 

gm financial formerly americredit corp which we acquired on october 1 2010 for cash of 35 billion is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992 gm financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships gm financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources the typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700 gm financial services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems since gm financial provides financing in a relatively highrisk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing 

gm financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and securitization trusts that issue assetbacked securities to investors gm financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by gm financial over the life of the securitization excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the assetbacked securities net of credit losses and expenses 

excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to gm financial or in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities in addition to excess cash flows gm financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts 

in november 2012 gm financial entered into an agreement with ally financial to acquire ally financials automotive finance and financial services operations in europe and latin america additionally in november 2012 gm financial entered into a share transfer agreement with ally financial to acquire ally financials equity interest in gmacsaic automotive finance company limited gmacsaic that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in china the purchases will allow gm financial to support our dealers in markets comprising 80 of our global sales the combined consideration will be approximately 42 billion subject to certain possible closing adjustments pursuant to the transactions gm financials assets are expected to double to approximately 330 billion and its liabilities including consolidated debt will increase to approximately

270 billion compared with 118 billion  at december 31 2012 the closings of the transactions are expected to occur in stages throughout 2013 

in april 2012 gm financial commenced commercial lending activities in the us centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites facilities facility improvements and working capital these loans are made on a secured basis we believe the availability of financing for our dealers is important to our business gm financial plans to launch similar commercial lending in canada during the first half of 2013 

in april 2011 gm financial began originating leases for our customers in canada via financialinx corporation given the importance of leasing and the previous lack of availability of leasing offerings to our customers in the canadian market due to regulatory restrictions preventing banks and bank holding companies from offering leasing in canada we believe having a captive financing offering in canada is strategically important to our business in august 2012 gm financial began offering consumer subprime financing in canada 

in december 2010 gm financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new gm vehicles during 2011 gm financial completed the nationwide rollout of the lease product in the us including separate product offerings for prime and subprime customers gm financial continues to expand its business in targeted areas that it views as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our business is highly dependent on sales volume there is no assurance that the global automobile market will not suffer another significant downturn 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume as demonstrated by the effect of sharp declines in vehicle sales on our and old gms business during the most recent economic downturn a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment the availability of credit fluctuations in the cost of fuel and consumer confidence in particular recent concerns over levels of sovereign indebtedness have contributed to a renewed tightening of credit markets in some of the markets in which we do business we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty and any change in economic and market conditions that negatively affects sales volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle the automotive industry particularly in the us is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and changing any negative perception in light of old gms bankruptcy will be critical to our longterm profitability we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2013 including our new 2014 chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra fullsize pickup trucks in north america a successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our short term profitability 

the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers there can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we are unable to achieve these goals we may not be able to maintain profitability over the longterm 

shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand 

volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which provide lower profit margins any increases in the price of oil in the us or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of political instability in the middle east south america and african nations could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles which could reduce our market share in affected markets decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives for our european operations our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations especially in europe while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our automotive manufacturing operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to provide us with systems components and parts and any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule and adversely affect our operations 

our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes results in our having minimal inventories of the systems components and parts we need to conduct our automotive manufacturing operations as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of systems components and parts at such times as allow us to meet our production schedules in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely and thus could adversely affect our financial results 

increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business including steel nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper and precious metals such as platinum and palladium the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices some of these raw materials such as corrosionresistant steel are only available from a limited number of suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances 

designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale we believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances which could adversely affect our competitiveness with respect to those competitors competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position which could also materially adversely affect our business 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries but we may not succeed in doing so and our failure to restructure these operations in a costeffective and nondisruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in 2012 the european automotive industry continued to be severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in response we are executing various actions to strengthen our european operations and increase our competitiveness the key areas of the plan include 

 

notwithstanding the above we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the european automotive industry will not improve significantly in the shortterm and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result in addition the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated as well as external factors which are outside of our control our inability to successfully restructure our european operations and implement our plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns 

our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market capacity to absorb a particular investment strategy or high volume transactions and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirement for our us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns as other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements are described in “managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities” 

factors which affect future funding requirement for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds which would negatively affect our cash flow 

we intend to rely on gm financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring subprime vehicle financing and gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

gm financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles because we intend to rely on gm financial to serve as an additional source of leasing and subprime financing options for consumers any impairment of gm financials ability to provide such leasing or subprime financing would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among consumers who rely on leasing and subprime financing options to acquire new vehicles the factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and impair its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing at competitive rates include 

 22 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

generate cash proceeds to repay its credit facilities and purchase additional loan receivables 

 

the above factors alone or in combination could negatively affect gm financials business and operations or its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and even if funded at anticipated levels may not result in successful vehicle applications 

we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2013 and 2014 largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate we may be forced to reduce delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology 

in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers for example we produce electric vehicles which require battery technology that has not yet proven to be commercially viable there can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies however our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information 

we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain management manufacturing invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of gm financial additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions or changes in existing ones may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future in the us and europe for example governmental regulation is driven primarily by concerns about the environment including greenhouse gas emissions vehicle safety fuel economy and energy security these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs including civil penalties they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the us vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the nhtsa and the epa the agencies have set coordinated fuel economy and greenhouse emission standards through the 2025 model year for light duty vehicles and through the 2018 model year for heavy duty trucks california which has set its own greenhouse gas emission standards through its ab 1493 rules has agreed to accept compliance with the national program as compliance with its state program 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding these us regulatory requirements and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated national program through the 2021 model year the standards for the 2022 through 2025 model years may be adjusted as a result of a midterm review by the agencies therefore we believe it is premature to project compliance with possible standards for those years we expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

the eu passed legislation effective in april 2009 to begin regulating vehicle co 2  emissions beginning in 2012 the legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020 with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells additional measures have been proposed or adopted in europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance vehicle air conditioners tire pressure monitors gear shift indicators and others at the national level 17 eu member states have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxidebased vehicle taxation system which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the eu emissions standards 

other governments around the world such as canada china brazil mexico and south korea are also creating new policies to address these same issues as in the us these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance the regulations will result in substantial costs which could be difficult to pass through to our customers and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which could affect our operations including facility closings reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations particularly in emerging markets are carried out by joint ventures such as sgm in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange and other rates 

given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can have material adverse effects on our business for example the recent strength of the canadian dollar cad versus the us dollar has had a negative impact on our profitability as parts and vehicles we manufactured in canada and exported to the us for sale are less competitive similarly a significant strengthening of the korean won relative to the us dollar or the euro would affect the competitiveness of our korean

operations as well as that of certain korean competitors as yet another example a relative weakness of the british pound compared to the euro would have an adverse effect on our results of operations in europe in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the us into us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date as a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business 

the majority of our vehicle sales are generated outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including 

 

the effects of these risks may individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our business 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards or changes in existing ones may have a significant negative effect on how we do business 

our products must satisfy legal safety requirements meeting or exceeding governmentmandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards while we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to reduce costs and lead times unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development testing and manufacturing governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

   from time to time we recall our products to address performance compliance or safetyrelated issues the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our common stock price to decline or impair our ability to raise capital 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that large sales could occur or the conversion of shares of our series b preferred stock or the perception that conversion could occur could depress the market price of our common stock of the 14 billion shares of our common stock issued and outstanding at december 31 2012 approximately 48 were held by the united states department of the treasury ust canada gen investment corporation a corporation organized under the laws of canada the uaw retiree medical benefits trust new veba and our us hourly and salaried pension plans in december 2012 the ust announced its intention to dispose of its remaining shares of our common stock over the following 12 to 15 months subject to market conditions sales or distributions of our common stock by these holders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

in addition at december 31 2012 there were warrants outstanding to acquire approximately 313 million shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from 1000 per share to 4231 per share and up to 152 million shares of common stock subject to antidilution makewhole and other adjustments will be issuable upon conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock outstanding exercises or distributions of warrants or the conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

presentation and estimates 

basis of presentation 

this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we analyze the results of our business through our five segments namely gmna gme gmio gmsa and gm financial 

consistent with industry practice market share information includes estimates of industry sales in certain countries where public reporting is not legally required or otherwise available on a consistent basis 

use of estimates in the preparation of the financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods 

prior period financial statements conformed to current period presentation 

in 2012 we changed the presentation of our consolidated balance sheet consolidated statements of cash flows and certain notes to the consolidated financial statements to classify the assets and liabilities of gm financial as current or noncurrent and to combine line items which were either of a related nature or not individually material we have made corresponding reclassifications to the comparable information for all periods presented 

overview 

our company commenced operations on july 10 2009 when we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of old gm through a 363 sale under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code by commencing operations following the 363 sale we were able to take advantage of a competitive labor agreement with our unions a restructured dealer network and a reduced and refocused brand strategy in the us focused on four brands 

in november and december of 2010 we consummated a public offering of 550 million shares of our common stock and 100 million shares of series b preferred stock and listed both of these securities on the new york stock exchange and the common stock on the toronto stock exchange in april 2011 in connection with mlcs distribution of warrants for our common stock to its unsecured creditors we listed the warrants expiring july 10 2016 and the warrants expiring july 10 2019 on the new york stock exchange 

automotive 

we offer a global vehicle portfolio of cars crossovers and trucks we are committed to leadership in vehicle design quality reliability telematics and infotainment and safety as well as to developing key energy efficiency energy diversity and advanced propulsion technologies including electric vehicles our business is diversified across products and geographic markets we meet the local sales and service needs of our retail and fleet customers with a global network of independent dealers of our total 2012   

general motors company and subsidiaries 

vehicle sales volume 721 was generated outside the us 

our automotive business is organized into four geographicallybased segments 

 

automotive financing  gm financial 

gm financial specializes in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by gm and nongm franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles gm financial also offers lease products through gm dealerships in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles that target customers with subprime and prime credit bureau scores gm financial primarily generates revenue and cash flows through the purchase retention subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization gm financial uses available cash and borrowings under its credit facilities gm financial earns finance charge income on finance receivables and pays interest expense on borrowings under its credit facilities gm financial periodically transfers receivables to securitization trusts that issue assetbacked securities to investors the securitization trusts are special purpose entities that are also variable interest entities that meet the requirements to be consolidated in the financial statements 

in april 2012 gm financial commenced commercial lending activities in the us centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites facilities facility improvements and working capital these loans are made on a secured basis we believe the availability of financing for our dealers is important to our business gm financial plans to launch similar commercial lending in canada during the first half of 2013 

our strategy 

our vision is to design build and sell the world’s best vehicles the primary elements of our strategy to achieve this vision are to 

 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

 

automotive financing strategy 

our automotive financing strategy centers around ensuring that our dealers and customers have consistently available transparent and competitive financing options throughout the business and credit cycles we achieve this through our captive finance capabilities at gm financial and through operating relationships with financial institutions including ally financial 

in october 2010 we acquired gm financial to further bolster our offerings in the leasing and subprime financing segments in the us and canada we believe that by having our own capabilities in key financing segments of the market we will be able to achieve more competition from other financing market participants which we believe improves pricing and service to our dealers and retail customers 

in november 2012 gm financial entered into an agreement with ally financial to acquire ally financials automotive finance and financial services operations in europe and latin america additionally in november 2012 gm financial entered into a share transfer agreement with ally financial to acquire ally financials equity interest in gmacsaic that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in china the purchases will allow gm financial to support our dealers in markets comprising 80 of our global sales the combined consideration will be approximately 42 billion subject to certain possible closing adjustments pursuant to the transactions gm financials assets are expected to double to approximately 330 billion and its liabilities including consolidated debt will increase to approximately 270 billion compared with 118 billion  at december 31 2012 the closings of the transactions are expected to occur in stages throughout 2013 

in april 2012 gm financial commenced commercial lending activities in the us centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites facilities facility improvements and working capital these loans are made on a secured basis we believe the availability of financing for our dealers is important to our business gm financial plans to launch similar commercial lending in canada during the first half of 2013 

in april 2011 gm financial began originating leases for our customers in canada given the importance of leasing and the previous lack of availability of thirdparty leasing offerings to our customers in the canadian market due to regulatory restrictions preventing banks and bank holding companies from offering leasing in canada we believe having a captive financing offering in canada is strategically important to our business in august 2012 gm financial began offering consumer subprime financing in canada 

in december 2010 gm financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new gm vehicles during 2011 gm financial completed the nationwide rollout of the lease product in the us including separate product offerings for prime and subprime customers gm financial continues to expand its business in targeted areas that it views as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market 

in addition to the financing we provide through gm financial we also ensure availability of competitive financing for our customers and dealers through operating relationships with financial institutions historically ally financial provided a majority of the financing for our dealers and a significant portion of the financing for our customers in the us canada and other major international markets where we operate ally financial continues to be the largest thirdparty provider of the financing for our dealers and customers we have added relationships with other financial institutions to increase our competitiveness and benefit from additional financing sources including arrangements to provide incentivized retail financing to our customers in the us canada uk and australia 

focus on chinese market 

we view the chinese market the fastest growing global market by volume of vehicles sold as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multibrand strategy led by our buick and chevrolet brands in the coming years we plan to increasingly leverage our global architectures to increase the number of nameplates under the buick chevrolet and cadillac brands in china and continue to grow our business under the baojun jiefang and wuling brands we operate in chinese markets through a number of joint ventures and maintaining good relations with our joint ventures partners which are affiliated with the chinese government is an important part of our china growth strategy

gme 

during the second half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 the european automotive industry has been severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity european automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 190 million  vehicles in 2012 representing a 56  decrease compared to 2011 in 2012 gmes market share declined to 85  from 87 in 2011 and the region suffered ebit lossadjusted of 18 billion  in 2012 compared to ebit lossadjusted of 07 billion  in 2011 during this timeframe we began to experience deterioration in cash flows 

in response we formulated a plan to implement various actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness the key areas of the plan include investments in our product portfolio a revised brand strategy significant management changes reducing material development and production costs and further leveraging synergies from the alliance between us and psa as subsequently discussed the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated as well as external factors which are outside of our control we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the european automotive industry will not improve significantly in the shortterm and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result during the fourth quarter of 2012 notwithstanding the above described actions gme performed below expectations relative to the key operating metrics of forecasted revenues market share and variable profit established in mid2012 further our industry outlook deteriorated and our forecast of 2013 cash flows declined this triggered a longlived asset impairment analysis 

we performed a recoverability test of the gme asset group by weighting various undiscounted cash flow scenarios the weighting of the projected cash flows considers the uncertainty in our ability to execute the actions contemplated in our plan which in part are dependent upon actions and factors outside our control our test concluded that the gme asset group was not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying amount accordingly we estimated the fair value of the gme longlived assets and adjusted the carrying amounts and recorded impairment charges of 55 billion as we have reduced the carrying amount of these assets by 55 billion depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced in future periods including approximately 06 billion in the year ending december 31 2013 which may result in an increase in our reported ebitadjusted in gme in subsequent periods refer to notes 11 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our real and personal property and intangible asset impairment charges 

alliance with psa 

in february 2012 we entered into an agreement with psa to create a longterm and broadscale global strategic alliance that is expected to leverage the combined strengths and capabilities of the two companies contribute to our profitability and improve our competitiveness in europe in march 2012 we acquired a seven percent equity stake in psa for 04 billion against which we recorded impairment charges of 02 billion  in the three months ended december 31 2012 in june 2012 we entered into a long 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

term exclusive service agreement with gefco a whollyowned subsidiary of psa to provide logistics services in europe beginning in 2013 in december 2012 psa sold its controlling interest in gefco to an unrelated thirdparty however the sale has no impact to the longterm exclusive service agreement in december 2012 we entered into a product development agreement to jointly develop and share certain vehicle platforms components and modules and we also signed a definitive agreement to create a joint purchasing organization in europe supported by a purchasing joint venture for the sourcing of commodities components and other goods and services based on the combined purchasing reach of both companies to realize purchasing synergies 

purchase of common stock 

in december 2012 we purchased 200 million shares of our common stock from the ust for total consideration of 55 billion we recorded a charge of 04 billion  in other automotive expenses net which represents a premium to the prior days closing price the ust agreed to irrevocably waive certain of its rights under the stockholders agreement by and among us and certain other stockholders and covenants under the ust credit agreement as part of the transaction to purchase our common stock these rights and covenants included among other items a reduction in certain reporting requirements and a release from the vitality commitment which contained certain manufacturing volume requirements additionally the ust publicly announced its intention to sell the remainder of its holdings of our common stock within 12 to 15 months after the execution of this transaction subject to market conditions 

ust invested capital 

ust invested capital totaled 495 billion representing the cumulative amount of cash received by old gm from the ust under the ust loan agreement and the debtorinpossession credit agreement excluding 04 billion which the ust loaned to old gm under the warranty program and which was repaid on july 10 2009 this balance also did not include amounts advanced under the ust ally financial loan as the ust exercised its option to convert this loan into ally financial preferred membership interests previously held by old gm in may 2009 at december 31 2012 the ust had received cumulative proceeds of 286 billion from debt repayments interest payments series a preferred stock dividends sales of our common stock and series a preferred stock redemption the usts invested capital less proceeds received totals 209 billion at december 31 2012 

restructuring activities special attrition programs labor agreements and benefit plan changes 

we have previously executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we plan to execute additional initiatives in the future if necessary in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing global automotive production and to improve the utilization of remaining facilities 

through december 31 2012 the active separation programs related to germany and the united kingdom had a total cost of 04 billion  and had affected a total of 2550  employees of which 03 billion  related to a program initiated in germany in 2010 this program was essentially completed in 2012 we expect to complete the active programs in 2013 and incur an additional 02 billion  which will affect an additional 700  employees 

in the year ended december 31 2012 gmio and gmsa each recorded charges of 01 billion  related to additional separation programs implemented in korea australia and brazil

benefit plan changes 

us salaried defined benefit pension plan 

in january 2012 we amended the salaried pension plan to cease the accrual of additional benefits effective september 30 2012 this amendment resulted in a curtailment which decreased the pension liability and decreased the net pretax actuarial loss component of accumulated other comprehensive loss by 03 billion  active plan participants receive additional contributions in the defined contribution plan starting in october 2012 

in august 2012 the salaried pension plan was amended to divide the plan to create a new legally separate defined benefit plan primarily for active and terminated vested participants after the amendment the original salaried pension plan retiree plan covers the majority of retirees currently receiving payments as a result of this amendment a remeasurement of the retiree plan on august 1 2012 increased the pension liability and the net pretax actuarial loss component of accumulated other comprehensive loss by 07 billion  due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate from 421  to 337  on a weightedaverage basis partially offset by actual asset returns in excess of expected amounts 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in august 2012 lumpsum distributions of 36 billion  were made from the retiree plan to 12500  plan participants resulting in a partial plan settlement necessitating a plan remeasurement for the retiree plan on august 31 2012 the settlement resulted in a pretax loss of 01 billion  the effect on our financial condition was insignificant 

in november and december 2012 the retiree plan purchased group annuity contracts from an insurance company and paid a total annuity premium of 251 billion  and the retiree plan settled two other previously guaranteed obligations with separate insurance companies totaling 19 billion  these agreements unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full payment of all annuity payments to the participants in the retiree plan and assume all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as the annuity contract premiums 

through these annuity purchase transactions we have settled the remaining obligations of the retiree plan in their entirety resulting in a pretax settlement loss of 25 billion   21 billion  after tax in automotive cost of sales the pretax loss is composed of existing losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 04 billion  and the premium paid to the insurance company of 21 billion  the tax benefit of 04 billion  is composed of the statutory tax benefit of 10 billion  offset by tax expense of 06 billion  primarily associated with the removal of prior period income tax allocations between accumulated other comprehensive loss and income tax expense benefit the ongoing annual impact to earnings will be 02 billion  unfavorable due to a decrease in pension income 

canadian salaried defined benefit plans 

in june 2012 we amended the canadian salaried pension plan to cease the accrual of additional benefits effective december 31 2012 active plan participants began receiving additional contributions in the defined contribution plan in january 2013 we also amended the canadian salaried retiree healthcare plan to eliminate post65 healthcare benefits for employees retiring on or after july 1 2014 in conjunction with this change we amended the plan to offer either a monthly monetary payment or an annual lumpsum cash payment to a defined contribution plan for health care in lieu of the benefit coverage provisions formerly provided under the healthcare plan 

venezuelan exchange regulations 

our venezuelan subsidiaries utilize the us dollar as their functional currency because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy the venezuelan government has introduced foreign exchange control regulations which make it more difficult to convert bolivar fuerte bsf to us dollars these regulations affect our venezuelan subsidiaries ability to pay nonbsf denominated obligations that do not qualify to be processed by the venezuela currency exchange agency at the official exchange rates 

in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced that the official fixed exchange rate of bsf 43  to 100  would be changed to bsf 63  to 100  the devaluation did not have an effect on the 2012 consolidated financial statements however the devaluation will require remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities in the three months ending march 31 2013 the devaluation effective date is february 13 2013 and is expected to result in a charge in the range of 01 billion to 02 billion

production and vehicle sales volume 

management believes that production volume and vehicle sales data provide meaningful information regarding our automotive operating results production volumes manufactured by our assembly facilities are generally aligned with current period net sales and revenue as we generally recognize revenue upon the release of the vehicle to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer which is shortly after the completion of production vehicle sales data which includes retail and fleet sales does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period however vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles and is the basis for our market share 

the tables which summarize production volume and sales of new motor vehicles and competitive position are presented in “item 1 business” 

reconciliation of consolidated automotive and gm financial segment results 

management believes ebitadjusted provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments operating results because it excludes interest income expense and income taxes as well as certain additional amounts management does not consider these excluded items when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources such as capital investment among business units and for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes such adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill and certain investments gains or losses on the settlementextinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of noncore investments management believes this measure allows it to readily view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions we believe ebitadjusted is useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and is therefore used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

while management believes that ebitadjusted provides useful information it is not an operating measure under us gaap and there are limitations associated with its use our calculation of ebitadjusted may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of ebitadjusted has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as net income or net income attributable to stockholders due to these limitations ebitadjusted is used as a supplement to us gaap measures 

management believes income before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding gm financials operating results gm financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment 

in 2012 we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt within corporate for segment reporting purposes and they are excluded from ebitadjusted previously gains and losses on extinguishment of debt were recorded within the applicable automotive segments this change is consistent with how management currently views the results of our operations

maintaining minimal financial leverage remains a key strategic initiative we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize our liquidity position and capital structure in order to strengthen our balance sheet including options to fund and derisk our pension plans we continue to evaluate potential repayments of obligations prior to maturity certain of which may be deeply discounted any such repayments may negatively affect our liquidity in the shortterm 

in december 2012 we purchased 200 million  shares of our common stock from the ust at a price of 2750  per share for a total of 55 billion  the purchase price represented a premium to the prior days closing price of 2549  we allocated the purchase price between a direct reduction to shareholders equity of 51 billion  and a charge to earnings of 04 billion  representing the premium and recorded in other automotive expenses net 

in the year ended december 31 2012 we made prepayments of 08 billion on debt obligations with a carrying amount of 05 billion we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 03 billion which primarily represented the unamortized debt discount on the gm korea mandatorily redeemable preferred shares 

in november 2012 we entered into two new secured revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 110 billion these facilities replaced our fiveyear 50 billion secured revolving credit facility and provide additional liquidity improved terms and increased financing flexibility including the ability to borrow in currencies other than us dollars the facilities are described below in greater detail 

in november and december 2012 the retiree plan purchased group annuity contracts from an insurance company to pay and administer future annuity payments to certain of our salaried retirees we provided the salaried pension plan with funding through contributions and shortterm interest free loans of 24 billion of which 23 billion was deemed a pension contribution at december 31 2012 refer to note 18  to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on pension activities 

investment actions 

from time to time we consider the possibility of acquisitions dispositions and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business these actions may include additional loans investments with our joint venture partners or the acquisitions of certain operations or ownership stakes in outside businesses these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the shortterm 

in november 2012 gm financial entered into agreements with ally financial to acquire substantially all of ally financials automotive finance and financial services business in europe and latin america and ally financials equity interests in gmacsaic that conducts automotive finance services operations in china the purchase price to acquire this business and equity interests is approximately 42 billion subject to certain possible closing adjustments and is expected to close in stages during 2013 refer to note 4  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our agreement to acquire certain ally financial international operations 

in september 2012 we acquired security interests in the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares issued by gm korea for 03 billion the transaction did not meet the criteria for an extinguishment of the liability therefore we have classified these interests as an availableforsale marketable security gm korea has since partially redeemed the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares which reduced the fair value of the security interests we hold to 02 billion at december 31 2012 

in february 2012 we entered into an agreement with psa to create an alliance to leverage the strengths and capabilities of our two companies and acquired a seven percent equity stake in psa for 04 billion against which we recorded impairment charges of 02 billion  in the three months ended december 31 2012 refer to note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment in psa

free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow 

management believes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the liquidity of our automotive operations and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow above those required in our business to sustain our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures we measure adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for certain voluntary management actions primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet these voluntary management actions represent items that management does not consider when assessing and managing the operational and financial performance of the organization and its management teams management believes that adjusting for these actions allows for greater transparency of operating trends and performance between periods while management believes that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide useful information they are not operating measures under us gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as cash flows from operating activities due to these limitations free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are used as supplements to us gaap measures the following table summarizes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow dollars in millions

general motors company and subsidiaries 



the increase in liquidity is due primarily to the issuance of senior notes of 10 billion  improved credit performance on consumer finance receivables which led to an increase in distributions from trusts and the settlement of several older securitizations with high enhancement levels 

as previously described gm financial has the ability to borrow up to 40 billion against our threeyear 55 billion secured revolving credit facility gm financials borrowings under the facility are limited by our ability to borrow the entire amount available under the facility therefore gm financial may be able to borrow up to 40 billion or may be unable to borrow depending on our borrowing activity if gm financial does borrow under the facility it expects such borrowings would be shortterm in nature neither gm financial nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any obligations under this facility and none of its subsidiaries assets secure this facility 

senior notes

defined benefit pension plan contributions 

eligible us salaried employees hired prior to january 2001 participated in a defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of september 30 2012 all eligible salaried employees now participate in a defined contribution plan hourly employees hired prior to october 15 2007 generally participate in plans which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service as well as supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age hourly employees hired after october 15 2007 participate in a defined contribution plan our policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulation or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate at december 31 2012 all legal funding requirements had been met we expect to contribute 01 billion  to our us nonqualified plans and 08 billion  to our nonus pension plans in 2013 

the following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans or direct payments dollars in millions 



in 2012 we provided shortterm interestfree unsecured loans to the retiree plan to provide the plan with incremental liquidity to pay ongoing benefits and administrative costs in august 2012 we loaned the retiree plan 20 billion  with principal due within 90 days  in the three months ended december 31 2012 15 billion  of the 20 billion  loan was contributed to the retiree plan 03 billion  was repaid to us and the remaining 03 billion  which had been converted into a new interestfree loan is due on or before april 15 2013 in october 2012 we provided a loan of 02 billion  to the retiree plan that was repaid to us in december 2012 at december 31 2012 02 billion  of the remaining 03 billion  loan was deemed a contribution amounts loaned to the retiree plan in excess of the ultimate funding requirements will be repaid to us 

we made a voluntary contribution in january 2011 to our us hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of 61 million shares of our common stock valued at 22 billion for funding purposes at the time of contribution the contributed shares qualified as a plan asset for funding purposes at the time of contribution and as a plan asset valued at 19 billion for accounting purposes in july 2011 this was a voluntary contribution above our funding requirements for the pension plans 

the following table summarizes the underfunded status of pension plans on a us gaap basis dollars in billions 



the us pension plans were underfunded by 140 billion and 142 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 the change in funded status was due primarily to 1 actuarial losses due primarily to discount rate decreases of 84 billion  and 2 service and interest costs of 45 billion partially offset by 3 actual return on plan assets of 103 billion and 4 contributions of 24 billion  

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the nonus pension plans were underfunded by 138 billion and 112 billion at december 31 2012  and 2011  the change in funded status was due primarily to 1 actuarial losses of 28 billion  2 service and interest costs of 15 billion 3 net unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 03 billion and 4 costs primarily related to plan amendments and other of 02 billion partially offset by 5 actual return on plan assets of 13 billion  and 6 contributions and benefit payments of 09 billion

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012  and 2011  

guarantees provided to thirdparties 

we have provided guarantees related to the residual value of operating leases certain suppliers commitments certain productrelated claims and commercial loans made by ally financial and outstanding with certain thirdparties excluding vehicle repurchase obligations residual support and risk sharing related to ally financial the maximum potential obligation under these commitments was 14 billion  and 11 billion  at december 31 2012  and 2011  

our current agreement with ally financial requires the repurchase of ally financial financed inventory invoiced to dealers with limited exclusions in the event of a qualifying voluntary or involuntary termination of the dealers sales and service agreement the repurchase obligation ended in august 2010 for vehicles invoiced through august 2009 ended in august 2011 for vehicles invoiced through august 2010 ended in august 2012 for vehicles invoiced through august 2011 ends in august 2013 for vehicles invoiced through august 2012 and ends in august 2014 for vehicles invoiced through august 2013 

the maximum potential amount of future payments required to be made to ally financial under this guarantee would be based on the repurchase value of total eligible vehicles financed by ally financial in dealer stock and is estimated to be 221 billion   

and 190 billion  at december 31 2012  and 2011  if vehicles are required to be repurchased under this arrangement the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer or at auction the fair value of the guarantee was 15 million  and 17 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  which considers the likelihood of dealers terminating and estimating the loss exposure for the ultimate disposition of vehicles 

refer to notes 20  and 27  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees we have provided 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities 

the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities at december 31 2012  dollars in millions

the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 27 billion  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts 

pension funding requirements 

in 2012 the us government enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates as a result under current economic conditions we expect no mandatory contributions to our us qualified pension plans for at least five years the new law does not impact our reported funded status or funding contemplated under our derisking initiatives 

we have implemented and completed a balance sheet derisking strategy comprising certain actions related to our us salaried pension plan these actions include payment of lumpsums to retirees the purchase of group annuity contracts from an insurance company and the settlement of other previously guaranteed obligations we provided the salaried pension plan with funding through contributions and shortterm interest free loans of 24 billion consisting of contributions of 15 billion  and 07 billion  and a loan of 03 billion  at december 31 2012 02 billion  of the remaining 03 billion  loan was deemed a contribution amounts loaned to the retiree plan in excess of the ultimate funding requirements will be repaid to us through these transactions we have settled the remaining obligations of the retiree plan in their entirety 

we do not have any required contributions payable to our us qualified plans in 2013 we expect to contribute 01 billion  to our us nonqualified plans and 08 billion  to our nonus pension plans in 2013

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods we have discussed the development selection and disclosures of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to these estimates 

the critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements and that use judgments and assumptions are listed below in addition the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions is discussed 

pensions 

the defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate the expected return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in january 2013 an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans taking into account the new plan structures that followed the derisking initiatives and annuity transactions executed during the second half of 2012 the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the us pension plans with resulting changes to the expected longterm return on assets the weightedaverage longterm return on assets decreased from 62  at december 31 2011 to 58  due primarily to lower yields on fixed income securities the us hourly plan assets now represent 91  of the total us pension plan assets compared to 65  at the end of 2011 

another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations we estimate this rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effect of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods 

the following table summarizes the unamortized actuarial loss before tax on pension plans dollars in billions 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions

valuation of deferred tax assets 

we evaluate the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances based on a more likely than not standard the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction we consider the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

 

the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors including but not limited to 

 

it is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years we utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years 

the evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events or otherwise could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2012 as a result of sustained profitability in the us and canada evidenced by three years of earnings and 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the completion of near and mediumterm business plans in the three months ended december 31 2012 that forecast continuing profitability we determined it was more likely than not future earnings will be sufficient to realize deferred tax assets in these two jurisdictions accordingly we reversed most of the us and canadian valuation allowances resulting in noncash income tax benefits of 332 billion  and 31 billion  we retained valuation allowances of 23 billion  against deferred tax assets in the us and canada related primarily to capital loss tax attributes and state operating loss carryforwards which we continue to believe do not meet the more likely than not threshold for releasing the valuation allowance we retained additional valuation allowances of 87 billion  against nonus deferred tax assets primarily related to gme and south korea business units with losses 

at december 31 2011 as a result of sustained profitability in australia we released the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a noncash income tax benefit of 05 billion  

if the remaining valuation allowance jurisdictions experience profitability in the future utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income will reduce the overall level of deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowances in the periods in which the valuation allowances are released we will record a tax benefit reflecting the release which will reduce our effective tax rate 

valuation allowance reversals in the us and canada contributed to goodwill impairment charges of 264 billion  in the gmna reporting unit in the three months ended december 31 2012 in south korea future valuation allowance reversals may result in additional goodwill impairment refer to note 12  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment charges 

in future periods our effective tax rate should approach the us statutory tax rate if law is enacted that reduces the us statutory rate we would record a significant reduction to the net deferred tax assets and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 

valuation of vehicle operating leases 

in our and gm financials accounting for vehicle operating leases a determination is made at the inception of a lease of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual values represent estimates of the market values of the vehicles at the end of the lease term a retail lease customer is obligated to make payments during the term of a lease up to five years to the contract residual a retail lease customer is not obligated to purchase a vehicle at the end of a lease sales to daily rental car companies with guaranteed repurchase obligations are accounted for as operating leases generally the terms under these arrangements are up to 24 months however the daily rental car companies can and do return the vehicles earlier averaging nine months or less we and gm financial are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of a vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception 

realization of residual values is dependent on the future ability to market vehicles under prevailing market conditions over the life of a lease the adequacy of the estimated residual values are evaluated and adjustments are made to the extent the expected values of the vehicles at lease termination declines adjustments may be in the form of revisions to depreciation rates or recognition of impairment charges impairment is determined to exist if the expected future cash flows which include estimated residual values are lower than the corresponding carrying amount 

the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying amount of leased vehicles included within equipment on operating leases net include 1 estimated market value information obtained and used in estimating residual values 2 proper identification and estimation of business conditions 3 remarketing abilities and 4 vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the estimate of residual values 

we and gm financial continue to use forecasted auction proceeds to estimate residual values for impairment purposes significant differences between the estimate of residual values and actual experience may materially affect impairment charges recorded if any and the rate at which vehicles in equipment on operating leases net are depreciated 

the following table summarizes recorded impairment charges related to leases to daily rental car companies dollars in millions 



impairment of goodwill 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in the three months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 for all reporting units which are gmna gme gm financial and various reporting units within the gmio and gmsa segments in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we performed eventdriven goodwill impairment tests at various dates for certain of our reporting units based on our testing procedures we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 271 billion and 13 billion in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 associated with our gmna gme gm korea gm south africa and gm holden ltd holden reporting units 

refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairments including information pertaining to the determination of the fair values of our reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis and the risks of future goodwill impairment charges 

subsequent to the recording of the goodwill impairment charges in the year ended december 31 2012 we had goodwill of 20 billion at december 31 2012 which predominantly arose upon the acquisition of americredit corp compared to 290 billion at december 31 2011 which predominantly arose upon the application of freshstart reporting when applying freshstart reporting certain accounts primarily employee benefit and income tax related were recorded at amounts determined under specific us gaap rather than fair value and the difference between the us gaap and fair value amounts gave rise to goodwill which is a residual our employee benefit related accounts were recorded in accordance with asc 712 compensation  nonretirement postemployment benefits asc 712 and asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits and deferred income taxes were recorded in accordance with asc 740 income taxes the application of asc 712 and 715 during freshstart reporting resulted in our recorded liabilities for certain employee benefit obligations being higher than the fair value of these obligations because lower discount rates were utilized in determining the us gaap values compared to those utilized to determine fair values the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of these obligations were based on our incremental borrowing rates which included our nonperformance risk our incremental borrowing rates are also affected by changes in market interest rates further upon the application of freshstart reporting the recorded amounts of our assets were lower than their fair values because of the recording of valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets which under asc 852 also resulted in goodwill if all identifiable assets and liabilities had been recorded at fair value upon application of freshstart reporting no goodwill would have resulted 

since freshstart reporting the differences between these fair valuetous gaap amounts 1 have decreased because of decreases in credit spreads between high quality corporate bond rates and market interest rates for companies with similar nonperformance risk 2 have decreased due to improvements in our credit rating thus resulting in a decrease in the spread between our employee benefit related obligations under us gaap and their fair values andor 3 decreased due to a change in the fair values of our estimated employee benefit obligations decreases also occurred from reversals of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances the fair valuetous gaap differences decreases for these reasons have resulted in the decline of implied goodwill in each of the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 at the next annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment test to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value or the reporting unit has a negative carrying amount a goodwill impairment could occur future goodwill impairments could also occur should we reorganize our internal reporting structure in a manner that changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units upon such an event goodwill would be reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relativefairvalue allocation approach unless the entity was never integrated and not based on the amount of goodwill that was originally attributable to fair valuetous gaap differences that gave rise to goodwill upon application of freshstart reporting 

for purposes of our 2012 annual impairment testing procedures at october 1 2012 the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 1118 for gmna 579 for gm mercosur and 147 for gm financial in calculating the fair values of our more significant reporting units during our 2012 annual goodwill impairment testing keeping all other assumptions constant the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units would still exceed their carrying amounts had our weightedaverage cost of capital wacc increased by 1000 basis points for gmna and 160 basis points for gm mercosur gm financials forecasted equitytomanaged asset retention ratio by 2015 was 125 and held constant thereafter gm koreas fair value continued to be below its carrying amount gm financials fair value would still exceed its carrying amount had equity to managed assets retention ratio increased 160 basis points by 2015 subsequent to our 2012 annual goodwill impairment testing we reversed deferred tax asset valuation allowances of 362 billion  for our gmna reporting unit causing its carrying amount to exceed its fair value as a result we performed an eventdriven goodwill impairment test in the three months ended december 31 2012 based on our testing we determined that the differences between the fair valuetous gaap amounts decreased primarily due to the recorded amount of our deferred tax assets exceeding their fair values which under asc 805 business combinations results in less implied goodwill based on this eventdriven impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 264 billion in the year ended december 31 2012 within our gmna segment 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

for purposes of our 2011 annual impairment testing procedures the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 123 for gmna 247 for holden 568 for gm mercosur and 103 for gm financial in calculating the fair values of our more significant reporting units during our 2011 annual goodwill impairment testing keeping all other assumptions constant the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units would still exceed their carrying amounts had our wacc increased by 150 basis points for gmna 410 basis points for holden and 430 basis points for gm mercosur gm financials forecasted equitytomanaged asset retention ratio by 2014 was 125 and held constant thereafter gm financials fair value would still exceed its carrying amount had equitytomanaged assets retention ratio increased 230 basis points by 2014 

based on the fair value measures determined during our 2012 and 2011 annual and eventdriven impairment tests we determined the fair values of those reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis gmna gme gm korea gm south africa and holden had not increased sufficiently to give rise to an implied goodwill amount other than the goodwill arising from the fair valuetous gaap differences attributable to those assets and liabilities that gave rise to goodwill upon application of freshstart reporting 

the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair valuetous gaap differences giving rise to the implied goodwill for the reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis are 1 the determination of our nonperformance risk 2 interest rates 3 estimates of our employee benefit related obligations and 4 the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets including our determination whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized of these factors the amount of implied goodwill within gmna was most sensitive to our determination whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will or will not be utilized within gme the goodwill assessment was most sensitive to changes in our nonperformance risk interest rates and estimates of our employee benefit related obligations the gm korea goodwill assessment is and the holden goodwill assessment was most sensitive to our determination of whether it is more likely than not that their deferred tax assets will or will not be utilized the gm south africa goodwill assessment was most sensitive to changes in our estimates of our employee benefit related obligations the 271 billion of impairment charges recorded in the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily driven by the 362 billion  reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances for our gmna reporting unit refer to note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the reversal of our valuation allowances for our us and canadian operations 

in the future we have an increased likelihood of measuring goodwill for possible impairment during our annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment testing because gm koreas fair value is less than its carrying amount which increases the likelihood of measuring goodwill for further impairment in the nearterm at december 31 2012 gm korea has 466 million of recorded goodwill 

impairment of longlived assets 

the carrying amount of longlived assets and finitelived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant if the carrying amount of a longlived asset group is considered impaired a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for the longlived assets or in certain cases the asset group to be held and used productspecific longlived asset groups are tested for impairment at the platform or vehicle line level nonproduct specific longlived assets are tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis in gmna gme and gm financial and tested at or within our various reporting units within our gmio and gmsa segments assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved we develop anticipated cash flows from historical experience and internal business plans a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the longlived asset impairment tests principally in determining the fair value of the asset groups and the assets average estimated useful life while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets could become impaired in the future as a result of declines in profitability due to significant changes in volume pricing or costs 

the carrying amounts of substantially all of gmes assets were established at fair value during freshstart reporting in the determination of fair value one of our key inputs was a forecasted cash flow projection during 2010 our actual cash flows approximated our projection during the second half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 the european automotive industry has been severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity during this timeframe we began to experience deterioration in cash flows in response we formulated a plan to implement various actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness the key areas of the plan include 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

investments in our product portfolio a revised brand strategy significant management changes reducing material development and production costs and further leveraging synergies from the alliance between us and psa 

we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the european automotive industry will not improve significantly in the shortterm and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result during the fourth quarter of 2012 notwithstanding the above described actions gme performed below expectations relative to the key operating metrics of forecasted revenues market share and variable profit established in mid2012 further our industry outlook deteriorated and our forecast of 2013 cash flows declined this triggered a longlived asset impairment analysis 

we performed a recoverability test of the gme asset group by weighting various undiscounted cash flow scenarios the weighting of the projected cash flows considers the uncertainty in our ability to execute the actions contemplated in our plan which in part are dependent upon actions and factors outside our control our test concluded that the gme asset group was not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying amount accordingly we estimated the fair value of the gme longlived assets to determine the impairment amount determining the fair value is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions considered to be level 3 inputs an inexchange premise was determined to be the highest and best use of the assets which is different than the assets current use due to the overall european macroeconomic environment refer to notes 11 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impairment charges recorded and related fair value measurements 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive sales and revenue and in certain instances as an increase to automotive cost of sales at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives 

policy product warranty and recall campaigns 

the estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold estimated costs related to product recalls are based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events however where little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable models revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

automotive 

we enter into a variety of foreign currency exchange and commodity forward contracts and options to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the risk management committee which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the risk management committee comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the audit committee a committee of the board of directors the audit committee assists and guides the board of directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the risk management committee our risk management policy intends to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

further information on our exposure to market risk is included in note 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations at december 31 2012  our three most significant foreign currency exposures were the eurobritish pound us dollarkorean won and eurokorean won derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2012  such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months 

  

at december 31 2012  and 2011  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 40 billion and 42 billion this presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 671 million and 637 million at december 31 2012  and 2011  

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses dollars in millions

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities 

at december 31 2012  we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations 

the following table summarizes our automotive debt by fixed rate and variable rate dollars in millions 



at december 31 2012  and 2011  the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 53 billion  and 55 billion  the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would be 112 million and 152 million at december 31 2012  and 2011  

we invest in marketable securities of various types and maturities the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates our marketable securities portfolio includes marketable securities classified as availableforsale and trading 

at december 31 2012  and 2011  we had marketable securities of 38 billion  and 101 billion  classified as availablefor sale with exposure to interest rate risk the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be 28 million and 28 million at december 31 2012  and 2011  

at december 31 2012  and 2011  we had marketable securities of 52 billion  and 60 billion  classified as trading with exposure to interest rate risk the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be 8 million and 20 million at december 31 2012  and 2011  

equity price risk 

at december 31 2012  the carrying amount of our investment in ally financial common stock was 399 million  the carrying amount of our investment in psa was 179 million  and the carrying amount of other investments was 21 million at december 31

2011  the carrying amount of our investment in ally financial common stock was 403 million  and the carrying amount of other investments was 36 million these amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss from these investments 

automotive financing  gm financial 

fluctuations in market interest rates affect gm financials credit facilities and securitization transactions gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of gm financials dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund purchases of finance receivables 

credit facilities 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities 

securitizations 

in gm financials securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions 

derivatives 

gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of 775 million  and 20 billion  at december 31 2012 and 2011 gm financial had interest rate swaps and caps in liability positions with notional amounts of 775 million  and 20 billion  at december 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant

competitive position 

information in this 2011 form 10k relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates of management and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture market share information in this 2011 form 10k is based on vehicle sales volume worldwide market share and vehicle sales data excludes the markets of iran north korea sudan and syria 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price quality available options style safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

in the year ended december 31 2011 our worldwide market share increased to 119  our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2011 reflect the moderate improvement in certain facets of the us economy which has contributed to a slow but steady improvement in us industry vehicle sales as well as increased volumes in russia and china 

in the year ended december 31 2010 our worldwide market share was 115  our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2010 were consistent with a gradual us vehicle sales recovery from the negative economic effects of the us recession first experienced by old gm in the second half of 2008 as well as increased volumes in china 

in the year ended december 31 2009 combined gm and old gm worldwide market share was 116  in 2009 the us and europe continued to be negatively affected by the economic factors first experienced in 2008 as their automotive industry sales declined 214 and 145 when compared to the year ended december 31 2008 although volumes increased in china

the following table summarizes us fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total us vehicle sales vehicles in thousands 



product pricing 

several methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2012 we will continue to price vehicles competitively including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices 

cyclical nature of business 

retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships 

general motors company and subsidiaries 



we enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial ally financial inc ally financial and other financial institutions 

the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters 

research product development and intellectual property 

costs for research manufacturing engineering product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers 

the following table summarizes research and development expense dollars in millions 



our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption 

fuel efficiency 

we are fully committed to meeting the requirements of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa and compliance with other regulatory schemes we plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 4 increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings and 5 portfolio changes including increasing carcrossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller more fuel efficient offerings 

alternative fuel vehicles 

alternative fuels offer the greatest nearterm potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop flex fuel vehicles that can run on gasolineethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we currently offer 20 flexfuel vehicles in the us for the 2012 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two we continue to study the future role flexfuel vehicles may play in the us in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure in 2011 94 of vehicle sales in brazil were flexfuel vehicles capable of running on 100 ethanol blends we also market flexfuel vehicles in australia thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace 

we support the development of biodiesel blend fuels which are cleanburning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels 

we produce compressed natural gas capable vehicles in europe such as the opel zafira and in the us the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers we offer lpg capable vehicles in select markets in europe asia pacific south america and north america reflecting the infrastructure regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold 

hybrid plugin extended range and battery electric vehicles 

we are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including hybrid plugin hybrid extended range and battery electric vehicles we currently offer eight hybrid models and continue to develop plugin hybrid electric vehicle technology phev and extended range electric vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera in 2013 we plan to produce the chevrolet spark battery electric vehicle we plan to invest heavily in 2012 to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and inhouse development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries electric motors and power control systems 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway are the largest in the world and have accumulated more than 23 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies 

onstar 

onstar corporation onstar is a wholly owned subsidiary of gm serving more than 6 million subscribers in the us canada and china onstar is a provider of connected safety security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on more than 45 of our 2012 model year vehicles onstar is also available for installation on most other vehicles already on the road through its recently launched onstar fmv onstars key services include automatic crash response stolen vehicle assistance remote door unlock turnbyturn navigation vehicle diagnostics and handsfree calling 

in recent years onstar has developed a system based on the findings of a center for disease control and prevention expert panel which allows onstar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants onstar also launched the automotive industrys first mobile application leveraging onstars unique connection to the vehicle to provide drivers with uptodate vehicle information such as oil level tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start and remote door unlock features and the ability to send directions from your phone to your vehicle 

product development 

our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization this strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development we define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces 

a centralized organization is responsible for many of the nonvisible parts of the vehicle such as steering suspension the brake system the heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system this team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand such as exterior and interior design tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

intellectual property 

we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business while none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 

raw materials services and supplies 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials are primarily composed of steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions the inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10 to 12 of our total purchases from 2009 to 2011 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic system obd requirements advanced obd systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems problems detected by the obd system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall emission and obd requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world 

north america 

the federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments these requirements include preproduction testing of vehicles testing of vehicles after assembly the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements we must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the united states environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the california air resources board carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

we believe that our vehicles meet the current epa and carb requirements if our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing or as part of government required defect reporting we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls and possible fines we expect that new carb and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicles emission performance 

fleetwide compliance with current epa and carb emission standards must be achieved based on a salesweighted fleet average carb has proposed its next round of emission requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2015 model year the epa is also developing similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year these requirements are expected to include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards both the epa and the carb have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement they are discussed under “automotive fuel economy” 

california law requires that 12 of 2012 model year cars and certain lightduty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles zev such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial zev credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

system warranties additional portions of the zev requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial zev requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plugin hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria we are complying with the zev requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the partial zev requirements carb has also proposed 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of zevs and phevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the states longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements twelve states as well as the province of quebec currently have these standards in effect one state has adopted those standards beginning in the 2014 model year and additional states could also adopt the california standards in the future 

vehicles equipped with heavyduty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements and could be recalled or fines could be imposed against us should testing or defect reporting identify noncompliance with emission requirements we also certify heavyduty engines for installation in other manufacturers products the heavyduty exhaust standards became more stringent in the 2010 model year we are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by epa and carb regulations obd requirements were first applied to heavyduty vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes 

europe 

emissions are regulated by two different entities the european commission ec and the united nations economic commission for europe un ece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 european union eu member states and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the un ece eu member states can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the eu member states type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations the regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer inuse surveillance program ec and un ece requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation 

a new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 5 standards was applied in 2009 while stricter euro 6 standards will apply beginning in 2014 the new european emission standards focus particularly on reducing emissions from diesel vehicles the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with euro 6 we expect that we will need to implement technologies which are identical to those being developed to meet us emission standards the technologies available today are not cost effective and would therefore not be suitable for the european market for small and midsize diesel vehicles which typically are under high cost pressure certain measures to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions have detrimental effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

in the longterm notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in europe regulatory discussions in europe are expected to continue regulators will continue to refine the testing requirements addressing issues such as test cycle durability obd inservice conformity and offcycle emissions 

international operations 

china has implemented euro 4 standards with european obd requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles beijing is expected to require many elements of euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles beginning in 2012 with additional elements of euro 5 standards to be enforced beginning in 2014 nationwide implementation of euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017 for dieselpowered vehicles china has implemented euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both lightduty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavyduty diesel vehicles enforcement of euro 4 standards for new diesel lightduty registrations has been delayed until 2013 

south korea has implemented euro 5 standards with european obd requirements for dieselpowered vehicles and carb standards for gasolinelpgpowered vehicles 

south america 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

certain countries follow the us test procedures standards and obd requirements and others follow the eu test procedures standards and obd requirements with different levels of stringency brazil implemented national l5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009 l6 standards for light diesel vehicles are to be implemented in 2012 which will mandate obd requirements for light diesel vehicles in 2015 l6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models argentina implemented euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2012 to 2013 for new vehicles and from 2014 to 2016 for all vehicles other countries in the south american region either have adopted some level of us or eu standards or no standards at all 

industrial environmental control 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions water discharges waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

the future effect of environmental matters including potential liabilities is often difficult to estimate at december 31 2011 our accruals for environmental liabilities were 169 million which is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites remediation periods typically range from five to 30 years 

site remediation 

the following table summarizes the expenditures for siteremediation actions including ongoing operations and maintenance dollars in millions 



it is possible that such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of 30 million over the next five years 

however currently unidentified remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible can not be determined with specificity because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site the involvement of other potentially responsible parties the application of laws and other standards or regulations site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations studies and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent duration and success of remediation as a result we are unable to determine with specificity the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites although that total could be substantial 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfillfree facilities at december 31 2011 81 or 52 of our facilities were landfillfree facilities at our landfillfree facilities over 90 of waste materials are recycled or reused and approximately 2 is converted to energy at wastetoenergy facilities we estimate that we recycled or reused over 26 million metric tons of waste materials at our global operations and estimate that we converted 65100 metric tons of waste materials to energy at wastetoenergy facilities in the year ended december 31 2011 

we continue to implement our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our green power purchases our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related co 2  emissions including collecting and verifying energy water and other environmental data from our facilities our approach to manage our greenhouse gas emissions includes a greenhouse gas reporting policy global process to collect accurate data internal and external targets and reporting progress against the established targets

automotive fuel economy 

north america 

corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleets domestically produced cars imported cars and lightduty trucks beginning with the 2011 model year both car and lightduty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes in 2011 our domestic car standard was estimated to be 298 mpg our import car standard was estimated to be 308 mpg and our lightduty truck standard was estimated to be 227 mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program 

in december 2011 the epa and the united states national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa issued a proposal to implement a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year lightduty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy this would represent a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year lightduty vehicles this program includes epa and nhtsa standards that will require an industrywide target standard of 250 grams of carbonrelated exhaust emissions per mile and 341 mpg by 2016 our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016 

the carb regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles which is the same as regulating fuel economy this california program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years carb has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the 2012 through 2016 model years 

a canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with us standards beginning with the 2011 model year however these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles 

the province of quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the california program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year 

europe 

legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle co 2  emissions beginning in 2012 based on a target function of co 2  to vehicle weight each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific salesweighted fleet average target this fleet average requirement will be phased in from 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 automobile manufacturers can earn supercredits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific co 2  value of less than 50 grams co 2  per kilometer this is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultralow co 2  vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the co 2  fleet average automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for ecoinnovations for those technologies which improve realworld fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle such as solar panels on vehicles there is also a 5 credit for flexfuel vehicles if more than 30 of refueling stations in an eu member state sell e85 further regulatory detail is being developed the legislation sets a target of 95 grams co 2 per kilometer for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement we have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in 2011 the eu adopted a standard to regulate co 2  emissions from light commercial vehicles this regulation is modeled after the co 2  regulation for passenger cars it proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average co 2  target of 175 grams co 2 per kilometer with a phase in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016 the manufacturerspecific co 2  compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel vehicle curb weight flexibilities such as ecoinnovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well an eu longterm target for 2020 of 147 grams co 2  per kilometer has been adopted for light commercial vehicles we have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

an ec regulation has been adopted that will require lowrolling resistance tires tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators by 2012 an additional ec regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise fuel efficiency and rolling resistance affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket 

seventeen eu member states have introduced fuel consumption or co 2  based vehicle taxation schemes tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the eu member states we are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws

international operations 

we face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries china has established new phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current phase 2 passfail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years implementation will be phased in beginning 2012 with full compliance required by 2015 china has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles extended range and plugin battery electric and fuel cell vehicles china is now working on a more aggressive phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years 

in korea new preliminary fuel economyco 2  targets for 2012 through 2015 and beyond were previously announced as part of the governments low carbongreen growth strategy these targets are based on each vehicles curb weight but in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economyco 2  targets in the us but less stringent than fuel economyco 2  targets in europe the proposed standards will be phased in beginning in 2012 and full compliance required by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify either on a fuel consumption basis or a co 2  emissions basis each manufacturer will be given a corporate target to meet based on an overall industry fleet fuel economyco 2  average other aspects of the program being considered include credits incentives and penalties korea has promulgated the new fuel economyco 2 regulation during the second quarter of 2011 

in australia the government is planning to adopt attributebased co 2  standards beginning in 2015 with standards expected to become more stringent through 2020 

south america 

in brazil governmental bodies and the automobile manufacturers association established a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines this voluntary program aims to increase vehicle energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban extraurban and combined equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements in the us driving conditions 

chemical regulations 

north america 

governmental agencies in both the us and canada have introduced regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives green chemistry and product stewardship initiatives these initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers responsibilities for vehicle lifecycle including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in cost and supply chain complexity 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances these regulations require chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 during the preregistration phase old gm and its suppliers registered those substances identified by these regulations these regulations are to be phased in over a 10 year period under these regulations substances of very high concern may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements we continually monitor the implementation of these regulations to maintain compliance and its effect on our suppliers and the automotive industry 

safety 

in the us if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us we are also required to report information concerning 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

outside the us safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures other countries pass regulations which are more stringent than us standards many countries require type approval while the us and canada require selfcertification 

vehicular noise control 

in the us passenger cars and lightduty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations we identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements medium to heavyduty trucks are regulated at the federal level federal truck regulations preempt all us state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10000 lbs 

outside the us noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level eg ec or un ece we believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold 

while current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels these proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles specifically hybrids and electrics may not be readily heard by pedestrians the nhtsa is required to study and issue regulations for the minimum level of sound for hybrid and electric vehicles by january 2014 the un ece is developing an international standard for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels 

we are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals 

potential effect of regulations 

we are actively working on aggressive nearterm and longterm plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities improve fuel efficiency monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers this is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of flexfuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles the conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfillfree status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability we believe that the development and global implementation of new costeffective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities 

despite these advanced technology efforts our ability to satisfy fuel economy co 2 and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic consumer legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements which include higher cafe standards and state co 2 requirements such as those which require the carb to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles ab 1493 rules then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

pension legislation 

we are subject to a variety of us federal rules and regulations including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended and the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans refer to note 18  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the ppa we do not have any required funding for our us qualified plans in 2012 we also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the us which are subject to local laws and regulations 

export control 

we are subject to us export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

controls our office of export compliance and our global export compliance officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nonus export controls are likely to become increasingly significant to our business as we develop our research and development operations on a global basis 

automotive financing  gm financial 

gm financial formerly americredit corp which we acquired on october 1 2010 for cash of 35 billion is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992 gm financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships gm financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources the typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700 gm financial services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems since gm financial provides financing in a relatively highrisk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing 

gm financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and securitization trusts that issue assetbacked securities to investors gm financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by gm financial over the life of the securitization excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the assetbacked securities net of credit losses and expenses 

excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to gm financial or in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities in addition to excess cash flows gm financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts 

in december 2010 gm financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new gm vehicles during 2011 gm financial completed the nationwide rollout of the lease product in the us including product offering for prime and subprime customers gm financial continued to expand its business in targeted areas that it viewed as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market we expect any expansion of gm financial including the anticipated expansion into offering commercial lending services to gm dealers in 2012 or any arrangements with other financing providers will complement our important relationship with ally financial 

in april 2011 gm financial began originating leases for our customers in canada

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our business is highly dependent on sales volume there is no assurance that the global automobile market will not suffer another significant downturn 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume as demonstrated by the effect of sharp declines in vehicle sales on our and old gms business during the most recent economic downturn a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales including real estate values levels of unemployment the availability of credit fluctuations in the cost of fuel and consumer confidence in particular recent concerns over levels of sovereign indebtedness have contributed to a renewed tightening of credit markets in some of the markets in which we do business we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty and any change in economic and market conditions that negatively affects sales volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers 

our ability to maintain profitability over the longterm depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle the automotive industry particularly in the us is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations and in the recent past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and changing this perception including with respect to smaller more fuel efficient vehicles as well as the perception of our company in light of old gms bankruptcy and our status as a recipient of aid under the troubled asset relief program tarp will be critical to our longterm profitability 

the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers government support of the production of vehicles with these technologies has led some consumers to have a negative impression of these vehicles which reduces sales there can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies in some cases with more money available will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage if we are unable to achieve these goals we may not be able to maintain profitability over the longterm 

shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand 

volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which provide lower profit margins and in recent years represented a smaller proportion of old gms and our sales volume in north america any increases in the price of oil in the us or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of political instability in the middle east south america and african nations could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles which could reduce our market share in affected markets decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives for our european operations our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations especially in north america and europe while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our structural costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

our automotive manufacturing operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to provide us with systems components and parts and any disruption in our suppliers operations could disrupt our production schedule and adversely affect our operations 

our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems components and parts that we need to manufacture our products our use of “justintime” manufacturing processes results in our having minimal inventories of the systems components and parts we need to conduct our automotive manufacturing operations as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of systems components and parts at such times as allow us to meet our production schedules a disruption in any of our suppliers operations even if for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter our production schedules or suspend production entirely for example in march 2011 we suspended production at our shreveport louisiana assembly facility due to a parts shortage resulting from the earthquake off the coast of japan in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions where we experience supply disruptions we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems components or parts could adversely affect our financial results 

increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business including steel nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper and precious metals such as platinum and palladium the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices some of these raw materials such as corrosionresistant steel are only available from a limited number of suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances 

designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale we believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances which could adversely affect 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our competitiveness with respect to those competitors competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position which could also materially adversely affect our business 

as part of our business plan and pursuant to the direction of the special master for tarp executive compensation we have limited cash compensation and certain benefits for our most highly paid executives and have reduced the number of our management and nonmanagement salaried employees and these actions may materially adversely affect our ability to hire and retain salaried employees 

as part of the cost reduction initiatives in our business plan and pursuant to the direction of the special master for tarp executive compensation the form and timing of the compensation for our most highly paid executives is not competitive with that offered by other major corporations furthermore while we have repaid in full our indebtedness under the united states department of the treasury ust credit agreement entered into july 10 2009 as amended ust credit agreement the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of section 111 of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa including the interim final rule implementing section 111 the interim final rule will continue to apply to us for the period specified in the eesa and the interim final rule certain of the covenants in the ust credit agreement will continue to apply to us until the earlier to occur of 1 us ceasing to be a recipient of exceptional financial assistance as determined pursuant to the interim final rule or any successor or final rule exceptional financial assistance or 2 ust ceasing to own any direct or indirect equity interests in us the effect of section 111 of eesa the interim final rule and the covenants is to restrict the compensation that we can provide to our top executives and prohibit certain types of compensation or benefits for any employees at the same time we have substantially decreased the number of salaried employees so that the workload is shared among fewer employees and in general the demands on each salaried employee are increased companies in similar situations have experienced significant difficulties in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees particularly in competitive specialties given our compensation structure and increasing job demands there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire and retain the employees whose expertise is required to execute our business plan while at the same time developing and producing vehicles that will stimulate demand for our products 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries but we may not succeed in doing so and our failure to restructure these operations in a costeffective and nondisruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries and we are actively working to accomplish this restructurings whether or not ultimately successful can involve significant expense and disruption to the business as well as labor disruptions which can adversely affect the business the restructuring of our european operations will require us to invest additional funds and require significant management attention we cannot assure you that any of our contemplated restructurings will be completed or achieve the desired results 

our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns 

our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments 

there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy insufficient market capacity to absorb a particular investment strategy or high volume transactions and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

our future funding requirement for our us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service irs depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns as other factors are held constant our potential funding requirements under various assumed scenarios are described in “managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations — contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities” 

if we are unable to meet our funding requirements for our us pension plans under the terms imposed by regulators at a given 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

point in time we would need to request a funding waiver from the irs if the waiver were granted we would have the opportunity to make up the missed funding with interest to the plan additional periods of missed funding could further reduce the plans funded status resulting in limitations on plan amendments and lump sum payouts from the plans continued deterioration in the plans funded status could result in the cessation of participants continued accrual of benefits under the terms of the plan until such time as the funding level of the plans meet irs requirements these actions could materially adversely affect our relations with our employees and their labor unions 

factors which affect future funding requirement for our us defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for nonus plans certain plans outside the us do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds which would negatively affect our cash flow 

our failure to successfully develop our own captive financing unit including through gm financial could leave us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have their own captive financing subsidiaries and that therefore may be able to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing on better terms than our customers and dealers are able to obtain 

many of our competitors operate and control their own captive financing subsidiaries if any of our competitors with captive financing subsidiaries are able to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing on better terms than our customers and dealers are able to obtain consumers may be more inclined to purchase our competitors vehicles and our competitors dealers may be better able to stock our competitors products 

through gm financial we offer leasing and subprime financing for our customers our failure to successfully develop our own captive financing unit including through gm financial could result in our loss of customers to our competitors with their own captive financing subsidiaries and could adversely affect our dealers ability to stock our vehicles if they are not able to obtain necessary financing at competitive rates from other sources 

we intend to rely on gm financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring subprime vehicle financing and gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

gm financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles because we intend to rely on gm financial to serve as an additional source of leasing and subprime financing options for consumers any impairment of gm financials ability to provide such leasing or subprime financing would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among consumers who rely on leasing and subprime financing options to acquire new vehicles the factors that could adversely affect gm financials business and operations and impair its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing at competitive rates include 

 

the above factors alone or in combination could negatively affect gm financials business and operations or its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

the ust or its designee owns a substantial interest in us and its interests may differ from those of our other stockholders 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

the ust owns 319 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of february 15 2012 as a result of this stock ownership interest the ust has the ability to exert significant influence over various matters through its power to vote for the election of our directors to the extent the ust elects to exert such significant influence over us its interests as a government entity may differ from those of our other stockholders and it may influence through its ability to vote for the election of our directors matters including 

 

in particular the ust may have a greater interest in promoting us economic growth and jobs than other stockholders of the company for example while we have repaid in full our indebtedness under the ust credit agreement a covenant that continues to apply until the earlier of december 31 2014 or the ust has been paid in full the total amount of all ust invested capital requires that we use our commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure subject to exceptions that our manufacturing volume in the us is consistent with specified benchmarks 

in the future we may also become subject to new and additional laws and government regulations regarding various aspects of our business as a result of participation in the tarp program and the us governments ownership in our business these regulations could make it more difficult for us to compete with other companies that are not subject to similar regulations 

our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and even if funded at anticipated levels may not result in successful vehicle applications 

we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2012 and 2013 largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the liquidity we anticipate we may be forced to reduce delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology 

in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers for example in november 2010 we began producing an electric car which requires battery technology that has not yet proven to be commercially viable there can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies however our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies in some cases they may have more money available and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information 

we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain management manufacturing invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of gm financial additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions or changes in existing ones may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future in the us and europe for example governmental regulation is driven primarily by concerns about the environment including greenhouse gas emissions vehicle safety fuel economy and energy security these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs including civil penalties they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue 

in the us vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the nhtsa and the epa the agencies have set coordinated fuel economy and greenhouse emission standards through the 2016 model year for light duty vehicles and through the 2018 model year for heavy duty trucks california which has set its own greenhouse gas emission standards through its ab 1493 rules has agreed to accept compliance with the national program as compliance with its state program the nhtsa and epa have proposed the next round of standards for the 2017 through 2025 model years epa projects that its proposed standards would achieve an average industry fleet of 163 gramsmile of co 2 in the 2025 model year which would be the equivalent of 545 mpg if all the co 2  emissions reduction came from fuel economy technology nhtsa is proposing standards that would require an average industry fleet fuel economy of 496 mpg in the 2025 model year   both agencies have proposed various flexibilities to incentivize early adoption and introduction of advanced technologies that are anticipated to help manufacturers achieve these standards california has stated that it will adopt standards for the same period and allow manufacturers to comply by meeting the national standards 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding these us regulatory requirements and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated national program through the 2021 model year the standards for the 2022 through 2025 model years may differ from the levels proposed as a result of a midterm review by the agencies therefore we believe it is premature to project compliance with possible standards for those years we expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

the eu passed legislation effective in april 2009 to begin regulating vehicle co 2  emissions beginning in 2012 the legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020 with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells additional measures have been proposed or adopted in europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance vehicle air conditioners tire pressure monitors gear shift indicators and others at the national level 17 eu member states have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxidebased vehicle taxation system which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the eu emissions standards 

other governments around the world such as canada china brazil mexico and south korea are also creating new policies to address these same issues as in the us these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance the regulations will result in substantial costs which could be difficult to pass through to our customers and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which could affect our operations including facility closings reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as sgm in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes or relationships deteriorate our success in the joint venture be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange and other rates 

given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can have material adverse effects on our business for example the recent strength of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar has had a negative impact on our profitability as parts and vehicles we manufactured in canada and exported to the us for sale are less competitive similarly a significant strengthening of the korean won relative to the us dollar or the euro would affect the competitiveness of our korean operations as well as that of certain korean competitors as yet another example a relative weakness of the british pound compared to the euro would have an adverse effect on our results of operations in europe in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the us into us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date as a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business 

the majority of our vehicle sales are generated outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including 

 

the effects of these risks may individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our business 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards or changes in existing ones may have a significant negative effect on how we do business 

our products must satisfy legal safety requirements meeting or exceeding governmentmandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards while we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to reduce costs and lead times unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development testing and manufacturing governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product 

the costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

from time to time we recall our products to address performance compliance or safetyrelated issues the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

the sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our common stock price to decline or impair our ability to raise capital 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that large sales could occur or the conversion of shares of our series b preferred stock or the perception that conversion could occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity and equityrelated securities of the 1565761986 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding at february 15 2012 approximately 55 were held by the ust canada gen investment corporation a corporation organized under the laws of canada canada holdings the uaw retiree medical benefits trust new veba and our us hourly and salaried pension plans sales or distributions of our common stock by these holders whether pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the exercise of registration rights could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

in addition at december 31 2011 there were warrants outstanding to acquire 313 million shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from 1000 per share to 4231 per share and up to 152 million shares of common stock subject to antidilution makewhole and other adjustments will be issuable upon conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock outstanding exercises or distributions of warrants or the conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock 

we have no current plans to commence payment of a dividend on our common stock our payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend on business conditions our financial condition earnings and liquidity and other factors so long as any share of our series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock remains outstanding no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid on our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock subject to exceptions such as dividends on our common stock payable solely in shares of our common stock in addition our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock subject to exceptions such as dividends payable solely in shares of our common stock 

any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock including our common stock in the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restricts our ability to pay dividends in cash on our common stock we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those agreements 

in addition under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory “surplus” which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities in each case at fair market value minus statutory capital or if there is no such surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year 

goodwill impairments could have a material noncash adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all reporting units or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review in the future should the recent economic uncertainty continue our equity price decline on a sustained basis global economies enter into another recession and industry growth stagnates or should we release deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions which could occur in the near future if additional positive evidence becomes available the fair value of one or more of our reporting units may decrease below its carrying amount and future goodwill impairments that may be material could be recognized in addition future goodwill impairments could occur should gme continue to have a negative carrying amount 

in these circumstances as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements future goodwill impairments would 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

largely be driven by decreases in the fair value to us gaap differences attributable to those assets and liabilities that gave rise to goodwill upon our application of freshstart reporting such decreases may occur upon an improvement in our credit rating a decrease in credit spreads between high quality corporate bond rates and market interest rates thus resulting in a decrease in the spread between our employee benefit related obligations under us gaap and their fair values andor a change in the fair values of our estimated employee benefit obligations a decrease would also occur upon reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances any declines resulting in a goodwill impairment may result in material noncash charges to our earnings

consistent with industry practice market share information includes estimates of industry sales in certain countries where public reporting is not legally required or otherwise available on a consistent basis 

use of estimates in the preparation of the financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods

chapter 11 proceedings and the 363 sale 

background 

over time as old gms market share declined in north america old gm needed to continually restructure its business operations to reduce cost and excess capacity legacy labor costs and obligations and capacity in its dealer network made old gm less competitive than new entrants into the us market these factors continued to strain old gms liquidity in 2005 old gm incurred significant losses from operations and from restructuring activities such as providing support to delphi and other efforts intended to reduce operating costs old gm managed its liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives capital markets transactions and sales of assets however the global credit market crisis had a dramatic effect on old gm and the automotive industry in the second half of 2008 the increased turmoil in the mortgage and overall credit markets particularly the lack of financing for buyers or lessees of vehicles the continued reductions in us housing values the volatility in the price of oil recessions in the us and western europe and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world created a substantially more difficult business environment the ability to execute capital markets transactions or sales of assets was extremely limited vehicle sales in north america and western europe contracted severely and the pace of vehicle sales in the rest of the world slowed old gms liquidity position as well as its operating performance were negatively affected by these economic and industry conditions and by other financial and business factors many of which were beyond its control 

as a result of these economic conditions and the rapid decline in sales in the three months ended december 31 2008 old gm determined that despite the actions it had then taken to restructure its us business it would be unable to pay its obligations in the normal course of business in 2009 or service its debt in a timely fashion which required the development of a new plan that depended on financial assistance from the us government 

in december 2008 old gm requested and received financial assistance from the us government and entered into the ust loan agreement in early 2009 old gms business results and liquidity continued to deteriorate and as a result old gm obtained additional funding from the ust under the ust loan agreement old gm also received funding from export development canada edc a corporation whollyowned by the government of canada under a loan and security agreement entered into in april 2009 edc loan facility 

as a condition to obtaining continued 2009 funding under the ust loan agreement old gm was required to submit a plan in february 2009 that included specific actions viability plan intended to result in the following 

 • a product mix and cost structure that is competitive in the us marketplace 

the ust loan agreement also required old gm to among other things use its best efforts to achieve the following restructuring targets 1 debt reduction of at least twothirds 2 labor modifications to achieve an average compensation competitive with that of foreignowned us domiciled automakers and 3 modification of certain retiree healthcare obligations 

the ust loan agreement provided that if by march 31 2009 or a later date not to exceed 30 days after march 31 2009 as determined by the presidential task force on the auto industry auto task force certification deadline the auto task force had not certified that old gm had taken all steps necessary to achieve and sustain its longterm viability international competitiveness and energy efficiency in accordance with the viability plan then the loans and other obligations under the ust 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

loan agreement were to become due and payable on the thirtieth day after the certification deadline 

on march 30 2009 the auto task force determined that the plan was not viable and required substantial revisions on march 31 2009 old gm and the ust agreed to postpone the certification deadline to june 1 2009 old gm made further modifications to its viability plan in an attempt to satisfy the auto task force requirement that it undertake a substantially more accelerated and aggressive restructuring plan revised viability plan the most significant of which included reducing old gms indebtedness and certain retiree healthcare veba obligations 

chapter 11 proceedings 

old gm was not able to complete the cost reduction and restructuring actions in its revised viability plan including the debt reductions and veba modifications which resulted in extreme liquidity constraints as a result on june 1 2009 old gm and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 chapter 11 proceedings of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court 

in connection with the chapter 11 proceedings old gm entered into a secured superpriority debtorinpossession credit agreement with the ust and edc dip facility and received additional funding commitments from edc to support old gms canadian operations 

the following table summarizes the total funding and funding commitments old gm received from the us and canadian governments and the additional notes old gm issued related thereto in the period december 31 2008 through july 9 2009 dollars in millions 



 

 

363 sale 

on july 10 2009 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of old gm from the sellers the 363 sale was consummated in accordance with a purchase agreement dated june 26 2009 as amended between us and the sellers and pursuant to the bankruptcy courts sale order dated july 5 2009 

in connection with the 363 sale the purchase price we paid to old gm equaled the sum of

general motors company and subsidiaries 

 

under the purchase agreement we are obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock adjustment shares to the guc trust following the dissolution of mlc in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against mlc as approved by the bankruptcy court exceed 350 billion refer to note 20  to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the contingently issuable adjustment shares 

agreements with the ust edc and new veba

additional modifications to pension and other postretirement plans contingent upon completion of the 363 sale 

we modified the us hourly pension plan the us executive retirement plan the us salaried life plan the nonuaw hourly retiree medical plan and the us hourly life plan these modifications became effective upon the completion of the 363 sale refer to note 18  to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the changes to these plans 

accounting for the effects of the chapter 11 proceedings and the 363 sale 

asc 852 is applicable to entities operating under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code asc 852 generally does not affect the application of us gaap that old gm followed to prepare the consolidated financial statements but it does require specific disclosures for transactions and events that were directly related to the chapter 11 proceedings and transactions and events that resulted from ongoing operations 

old gm prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance in asc 852 in the period june 1 2009 through july 9 2009 revenues expenses realized gains and losses and provisions for losses directly related to the chapter 11 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

proceedings were recorded in reorganization gains net reorganization gains net do not constitute an element of operating loss due to their nature and due to the requirement that they be reported separately cash amounts provided by or used in the chapter 11 proceedings are separately disclosed in the statement of cash flows 

effect of freshstart reporting 

the application of freshstart reporting significantly affected certain assets liabilities and expenses as a result certain financial information at and for any period after july 10 2009 is not comparable to old gms financial information therefore we did not combine certain financial information in the period july 10 2009 through december 31 2009 with old gms financial information in the period january 1 2009 through july 9 2009 for comparison to other periods for the purpose of the following discussion we have combined our total net sales and revenue in the period july 10 2009 through december 31 2009 with old gms total net sales and revenue in the period january 1 2009 through july 9 2009 total net sales and revenue was not significantly affected by freshstart reporting and therefore we combined automotive total net sales and revenue data comparing the total net sales and revenue between years presented 

total net sales and revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from the sales of vehicles in addition to revenue from onstar our customer subscription service vehicle sales accounted for as operating leases sales of parts and accessories and gm financials loan purchasing and servicing activities 

automotive cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization policy and warranty costs postemployment benefit costs and separation and impairment charges prior to our application of freshstart reporting on july 10 2009 automotive cost of sales also included gains and losses on derivative instruments effective july 10 2009 gains and losses related to all nondesignated derivatives are recorded in interest income and other nonoperating income net 

automotive selling general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of costs related to the advertising selling and promotion of products support services including central office expenses labor and benefit expenses for employees not considered part of the manufacturing process consulting costs rental expense for offices bad debt expense and nonincome based state and local taxes

automotive financing strategy 

our automotive financing strategy centers around ensuring that our dealers and customers have consistently available transparent and competitive financing options throughout the business and credit cycles 

historically ally financial has provided a majority of the financing for our dealers and a significant portion of the financing for our customers in the us canada and other major international markets where we operate ally financial historically has been our exclusive financing partner for incentivized retail financing programs in our major markets ally financial continues to provide the majority of the financing needs of our dealers and customers 

the market disruption of 2008 and 2009 highlighted the need to ensure certainty of availability of credit throughout economic cycles in specific segments of the automotive financing market in the us and canada we identified leasing and subprime lending as underserved areas that could benefit from increased financing sources and competition in 2009 we partnered with a bank to offer incentivized leasing programs and with gm financial to offer incentivized subprime retail financing in the us we also partnered with a bank to offer incentivized retail financing programs in canada 

in october 2010 we acquired gm financial to further bolster our offerings in the leasing and subprime financing segments in the us and canada we believe that by having our own capabilities in key segments of the market we will be able to achieve more competition and better service from the market while ensuring certainty of availability through the business cycles 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in april 2011 gm financial began originating leases for our customers in canada given the importance of leasing and the current lack of availability of leasing offerings to our customers in the canadian market due to regulatory restrictions preventing banks and bank holding companies from offering leasing in canada we believe having a captive financing offering in canada is strategically important to our business gm financial began originating leases for gm customers in canada via financialinx corporation in april 2011 

we will continue to expand the business of gm financial in targeted areas including wholesale lending that we view as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market both in the us and internationally we expect any expansion of gm financial or any arrangements with other financing providers will complement our important relationship with ally financial

general motors company and subsidiaries 

become effective until approved by the bankruptcy court in mlcs chapter 11 proceedings which occurred in november 2009 several additional unions representing mlc hourly retirees joined the iuecwa and usw settlement agreement with respect to healthcare and life insurance the remeasurement of these plans resulted in a decrease in a contingent liability accrual and an offsetting increase in the projected benefit obligation pbo or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo of the benefit plan 

2009 caw agreement 

in march 2009 members of the caw ratified an agreement intended to reduce costs in canada through introducing copayments for healthcare benefits increasing employee healthcare cost sharing freezing pension benefits and eliminating cost of living adjustments to pensions for retired hourly workers the 2009 caw agreement was conditioned on old gm receiving longer term financial support from the canadian and ontario governments and those governments agreed to the terms of a loan agreement approved the gmcl viability plan and provided funding to gmcl the canadian hourly defined benefit pension plan was remeasured in june 2009 

the caw hourly retiree healthcare plan and the caw retiree life plan were also remeasured in june 2009 additionally as a result of the termination of employees from the former oshawa ontario truck facility gmcl recorded a curtailment gain associated with the caw hourly retiree healthcare plan 

venezuelan exchange regulations 

our venezuelan subsidiaries changed their functional currency from bolivar fuerte bsf the local currency to the us dollar our reporting currency on january 1 2010 because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy in january 2010 there was a devaluation of the venezuelan currency and establishment of dual fixed exchange rates an essential rate and a nonessential rate 

in june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced additional foreign currency exchange control regulations which imposed restrictions on the use of the parallel foreign currency exchange market thereby making it more difficult to convert bsf to us dollars the restrictions on the foreign currency exchange market affect our venezuelan subsidiaries ability to pay nonbsf denominated obligations that do not qualify to be processed by the venezuela currency exchange agency at the official exchange rates 

effective january 1 2011 the bsf was further devalued and the essential rate was eliminated the devaluation has affected results of operations in 2011 because our venezuelan subsidiaries no longer realize gains that result from favorable foreign currency exchanges processed by the venezuela currency exchange agency at the essential rate

reconciliation of consolidated automotive and gm financial segment results 

management believes ebitadjusted provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments operating results because it excludes interest income expense and income taxes as well as certain additional amounts management does not consider these excluded items when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources such as capital investment among business units and for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes such adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill and certain investments gains or losses on the settlementextinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of noncore investments management believes this measure allows it to readily view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions we believe ebitadjusted is useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and are therefore used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

while management believes that ebitadjusted provides useful information it is not an operating measure under us gaap and there are limitations associated with its use our calculation of ebitadjusted may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of ebitadjusted has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as net income loss or net income loss attributable to stockholders due to these limitations ebitadjusted is used as a supplement to us gaap measures 

management believes income before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding gm financials operating results gm financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment ebitadjusted is not presented for the period january 1 2009 through july 9 2009 as old gm did not identify adjustments to ebit during this period

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity overview 

we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs however we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through available liquidity and cash flow from operations our known material future uses of cash include among other possible demands 1 reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures engineering and product development activities 2 pension contributions and opeb payments 3 payments to reduce debt and other longterm obligations 4 dividend payments on our series a and series b preferred shares and 5 certain south american income and indirect taxrelated administrative proceedings may require that we deposit funds in escrow or make payments which may range up to 08 billion 

our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those described in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” some of which are outside our control macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans 

recent management initiatives 

we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize our liquidity position and capital structure in order to strengthen our balance sheet 

reduction of financial leverage 

reducing our financial leverage remains a key strategic initiative we continue to evaluate potential repayments of longterm obligations prior to maturity any such repayments may negatively affect our liquidity in the shortterm 

in the year ended december 31 2011 we made prepayments on debt facilities of 10 billion held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries primarily in gmna and gmsa however our overall debt balances increased to 53 billion at december 31 2011 as these prepayments were more than offset primarily by the issuance of the hct notes that were incurred as part of an agreement to settle certain retiree healthcare obligations and increases to other debt facilities 

we made a voluntary contribution in january 2011 to our us hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of 61 million shares of our common stock valued at 22 billion for funding purposes at the time of contribution the contributed shares qualified as a plan asset for funding purposes at the time of contribution and as a plan asset valued at 19 billion for accounting purposes in july 2011 this contribution was made as part of our continuing efforts to mitigate risk in our balance sheet 

under wholesale financing arrangements our us dealers typically borrow money from financial institutions to fund their vehicle purchases from us effective january 2011 we terminated a wholesale advance agreement which provided for accelerated receipt of payments made by ally financial on behalf of our us dealers pursuant to ally financials wholesale financing arrangements with dealers similar modifications were made in canada and mexico in the year ended december 31 2011 the wholesale advance agreements covered the period for which vehicles are in transit between assembly plants and dealerships we no longer receive payments in advance of the date vehicles purchased by dealers are scheduled to be delivered in gmna resulting in an increase to our accounts receivable balance of 11 billion at december 31 2011 the amount of the increase to our accounts receivable balance depends on sales volumes seasonal fluctuations and certain other factors 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

in january 2011 we withdrew our application for loans available under section 136 of the eisa this decision is consistent with our stated goal to reduce our financial leverage 

investment actions 

we accumulated canadian dollar denominated deposits and investments of 64 billion in the year ended december 31 2011 these deposits and investments will incur foreign exchange gains or losses based on the movement of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar and will therefore reduce our net canadian dollar foreign exchange exposure which primarily relates to pension and opeb liabilities we expect to maintain a sufficient amount of canadian dollar deposits and investments to offset the liabilities denominated in canadian dollars these funds continue to be available to fund our normal ongoing operations and are included in our available liquidity 

we continue to monitor and explore the sale of other noncore assets in march 2011 we sold our class a membership interests in new delphi to new delphi for 38 billion also in march 2011 we sold our ally financial preferred stock for 10 billion proceeds from these asset sales were used to strengthen liquidity and are to be used for general corporate purposes 

from time to time we consider the possibility of acquisitions dispositions and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business this may include additional loans or investments with our joint venture partners and may negatively impact our liquidity in the shortterm

our largest credit facility is our five year 50 billion secured revolving credit facility which includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to 500 million additionally we can use collateral under the revolving credit facility to support up to 20 billion of other obligations we continue to evaluate potential uses for this collateral which may strengthen our overall liquidity position without impacting our financial leverage we entered into the secured revolving credit facility agreement in october 2010 while we do not believe that we will draw on the secured revolving credit facility to fund operating activities the facility provides additional liquidity and financing flexibility availability under the secured revolving credit facility is subject to borrowing base restrictions our obligations under the secured revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by a substantial portion of our domestic assets excluding cash cash equivalents marketable securities and gm financial if we receive an investment grade corporate rating from two or more of the credit rating agencies fitch ratings fitch moodys

free cash flow 

management believes free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the liquidity of our automotive operations and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow above those required in our business to sustain our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flow from operations adjusted for capital expenditures while management believes that free cash flow provides useful information it is not an operating measure under us gaap and there are limitations associated with its use our calculation of free cash flow may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of free cash flow has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as cash flows from operating activities due to these limitations free cash flow is used as a supplement to us gaap measures the following table summarizes free cash flow dollars in millions

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not currently utilize offbalance sheet securitization arrangements all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 

guarantees provided to third parties 

we have provided guarantees related to the residual value of operating leases certain suppliers commitments certain productrelated claims and commercial loans made by ally financial and outstanding with certain third parties excluding vehicle repurchase obligations residual support and risk sharing related to ally financial the maximum potential obligation under these commitments was 11 billion and 10 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 

our current agreement with ally financial requires the repurchase of ally financial financed inventory invoiced to dealers with limited exclusions in the event of a qualifying voluntary or involuntary termination of the dealers sales and service agreement the repurchase obligation ended in august 2010 for vehicles invoiced through august 2009 ended in august 2011 for vehicles invoiced through august 2010 ends in august 2012 for vehicles invoiced through august 2011 and ends in august 2013 for vehicles invoiced through august 2012 

the maximum potential amount of future payments required to be made to ally financial under this guarantee would be based on the repurchase value of total eligible vehicles financed by ally financial in dealer stock and is estimated to be 198 billion and 188 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 if vehicles are required to be repurchased under this arrangement the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer or at auction the fair value of the guarantee was 17 million  and 21 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 which considers the likelihood of dealers terminating and estimating the loss exposure for the ultimate disposition of vehicles 

refer to notes 20  and 28  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees we have provided 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities

pension funding requirements 

the next pension funding valuation to be prepared based on the requirements of the ppa will be as of october 1 2011 based on the ppa we have the option to select a funding interest rate for the valuation based on either the full yield curve method or the 3segment method both of which are considered to be acceptable methods a hypothetical valuation at december 31 2011 using the 3segment rate at may 31 2011 for the plan year beginning october 1 2011 and assuming either the full yield curve rate or the 3segment rate at december 31 2011 for all future valuations projects no funding requirements through 2017 we have assumed that the pension plans in the future earn the expected return on assets of 57 for the salaried plan and 65 for the

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods we have discussed the development selection and disclosures of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to these estimates 

the critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements and that use judgments and assumptions are listed below in addition the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions

pensions 

the defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate the expected return on us plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return 

in december 2011 an analysis of the investment policy was completed for the us pension plans considering 1 our overall balance sheet derisking strategy 2 the plans are closed to new participants and 3 the 2011 uaw negotiations did not increase pension benefits separate longterm strategies were developed for the salaried and hourly us pension plans which represent 35 and 65 of total us pension plans assets using an approach which matches plan assets and liability cash flows to minimize risk of funded status volatility the expected weightedaverage return on assets was reduced from 80  at december 31 2010 to 57  for the salaried pension plan and to 65  for the hourly pension plan the resulting weightedaverage return is 62  the overall decrease is primarily due to a different asset mix consisting of a higher proportion of fixed income investments compared to last year the salaried pension plan has a higher target proportion of fixed income investments than the hourly pension plan and therefore a lower expected return on assets than the hourly pension plan 

another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations we estimate this rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations the effect of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods 

the following table summarizes the unamortized actuarial gain loss before tax on pension plans dollars in billions 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions

other postretirement benefits 

opeb plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including a discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates in the us old gm established a discount rate assumption to reflect the yield of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to satisfy projected future benefits 

refer to note 18  to our consolidated financial statements for the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine net opeb expense 

valuation of deferred tax assets 

we establish and old gm established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction we consider and old gm considered the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

 

the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors including but not limited to 

 

it is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years we utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years 

the evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events or otherwise could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

though objective and verifiable negative evidence continues to outweigh positive evidence in jurisdictions with significant valuation allowances we are experiencing positive evidence trends in certain of these jurisdictions south korea operations have overcome adjusted threeyear cumulative losses due to recent profitability however a number of negative evidence factors continue 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

to affect the need for a valuation allowance such as economic and industry uncertainty and limited carryforward lives of key tax attributes after reviewing all factors if additional positive evidence becomes available we may reverse some or all of our south korean valuation allowance in the future at december 31 2011 the deferred tax valuation allowance for south korea was 08 billion 

us and canadian operations are also experiencing current profitability but these operations remain in cumulative threeyear loss position at december 31 2011 to the extent this profitability trend continues it is reasonably possible our conclusion regarding the need for full valuation allowances could change resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowances at december 31 2011 deferred tax asset valuation allowances for the us and canada were 364 billion and 32 billion 

in a valuation allowance environment utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduces the overall level of deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance additionally our recorded effective tax rate is lower than the applicable statutory tax rate due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions for which a full valuation allowance is recorded our effective tax rate will approach the statutory tax rate in periods after valuation allowances are reversed in the quarter in which valuation allowances are released we will record a material tax benefit reflecting the release which could result in a negative effective tax rate valuation allowance releases could result in goodwill impairment refer to note 12  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment charges 

valuation of vehicle operating leases and valuation of residual support and risk sharing reserve 

valuation of vehicle operating leases 

in accounting for vehicle operating leases a determination is made at the inception of a lease of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from six months to five years a retail lease customer is obligated to make payments during the term of a lease to the contract residual a retail lease customer is not obligated to purchase a vehicle at the end of a lease sales to daily rental car companies with guaranteed repurchase obligations are accounted for as operating leases generally the terms under these arrangements are up to 24 months however the daily rental car companies can and do return the vehicles earlier averaging nine months we are and old gm was exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of a vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception 

realization of residual values is dependent on the future ability to market vehicles under prevailing market conditions over the life of a lease the adequacy of the estimated residual value is evaluated and adjustments are made to the extent the expected value of a vehicle at lease termination declines adjustments may be in the form of revisions to depreciation rates or recognition of impairment charges impairment is determined to exist if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the carrying amount of the leased vehicle 

the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying amount of leased vehicles included within equipment on operating leases net include 1 estimated market value information obtained and used in estimating residual values 2 proper identification and estimation of business conditions 3 remarketing abilities and 4 vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the estimate of residual values 

we continue to use forecasted auction proceeds to estimate residual values for impairment purposes significant differences between the estimate of residual values and actual experience may materially affect impairment charges recorded if any and the rate at which vehicles in equipment on operating leases net are depreciated 

the following table summarizes recorded impairment charges related to leases to daily rental car companies and automotive retail leases dollars in millions

valuation of residual support and risk sharing reserve 

significant differences between estimated and actual residual values will also affect the residual support and risk sharing reserves established as a result of certain agreements with ally financial whereby ally financial is reimbursed up to an agreedupon percentage of certain residual value losses they experience on their operating lease portfolio 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded favorable adjustments to our residual support and risk sharing liabilities of 05 billion in the us due to increases in estimated and actual residual values at contract termination 

due to the contractual terms of our residual support and risk sharing agreements with ally financial which currently limit our maximum obligation to ally financial should vehicle residual values decrease an increase in sales proceeds does not have the equivalent offsetting effect on our residual support and risk sharing reserves as a decrease in sales proceeds 

the following table summarizes the maximum obligation and recorded receivables and liabilities associated with the contractual terms of our residual support and risk sharing agreements with ally financial dollars in millions 



the decrease in risk sharing and residual amounts is due to liquidation of the lease portfolio for which we have obligations 

impairment of goodwill 

at december 31 2011 we had goodwill of 290 billion  which predominately arose upon the application of freshstart reporting and the acquisition of americredit when applying freshstart reporting certain accounts primarily employee benefit and income tax related were recorded at amounts determined under specific us gaap rather than fair value and the difference between the us gaap and fair value amounts gives rise to goodwill which is a residual our employee benefit related accounts were recorded in accordance with asc 712 compensation — nonretirement postemployment benefits and asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits and deferred income taxes were recorded in accordance with asc 740 income taxes further we recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets which under asc 852 also resulted in goodwill if all identifiable assets and liabilities had been recorded at fair value upon application of freshstart reporting no goodwill would have resulted 

in the three months ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 for all reporting units which are gmna gme gm financial and various reporting units within the gmio and gmsa segments based on this testing we determined that goodwill was impaired for our gm korea reporting unit at october 1 2011 subsequent to our 2011 annual impairment testing we reversed a valuation allowance for our holden reporting unit that resulted in the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value and determined that there was an eventdriven impairment in our gm korea reporting unit as such we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 270 million  in the three months ended december 31 2011 within our gmio segment we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 395 million  in the three months ended march 31 2011 and 621 million  in the three months ended december 31 2011 pertaining to our gme reporting unit refer to notes 3  and 12  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these goodwill impairment charges including disclosure on our adoption of accounting standard update 201028 intangibles — goodwill and other when to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 

when performing our goodwill impairment testing the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on valuation techniques using the best available information primarily discounted cash flow projections we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates market share and discount rates the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty where available and as appropriate comparative market multiples and the quoted market price of our common stock are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method while we believe that the assumptions and estimates used 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect on the consolidated financial statements assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units excluding gm financial include 

 

the valuation methodologies utilized to perform our goodwill impairment testing were consistent with those used in our application of freshstart reporting on july 10 2009 and in any subsequent annual or eventdriven impairment tests and utilized level 3 measures 

the following table summarizes the goodwill balances and key assumptions for each of our more significant reporting units excluding gm financial utilized in our 2011 and 2010 annual goodwill impairment tests dollars and volumes in millions 



 

 

the waccs considered various factors including bond yields risk premiums and tax rates the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied a reporting units longterm growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period and industry sales and a market share for each reporting unit included annual estimates through the forecast period in addition minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated 

with regard to gm financial with goodwill of 13 billion at october 1 2011 key assumptions impacting our 2011 annual impairment testing procedures include forecasted asset composition and growth and equity to managed asset retention ratios forecasted equity to managed asset retention ratio by 2014 was 125 and held constant thereafter 

our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value the estimates and assumptions used are subject to significant uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and there is no assurance that anticipated financial results will be achieved 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

for purposes of our 2011 annual impairment testing procedures the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 123 for gmna 247 for holden 568 for gm mercosur and 103 for gm financial in calculating the fair values of our more significant reporting units during our 2011 annual goodwill impairment testing keeping all other assumptions constant the estimated fair values of our more significant reporting units would still exceed their carrying amounts had our wacc increased by 150 basis points for gmna 410 basis points for holden and 430 basis points for gm mercosur for gm financial fair value would still exceed its carrying amount had equity to managed assets retention ratio increased 230 basis points by 2014 

based on the fair value measures determined during our 2011 annual and eventdriven impairment tests we determined the fair values of those reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis gme gm korea and holden had not increased sufficiently to give rise to an implied goodwill amount other than the goodwill arising from the fair valuetous gaap differences attributable to those assets and liabilities that gave rise to goodwill upon application of freshstart reporting 

the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair valuetous gaap differences giving rise to the implied goodwill for the reporting units requiring a step 2 analysis are the determination of our nonperformance risk interest rates estimates of our employee benefit related obligations andor the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets including our determination whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized of these factors the amount of implied goodwill within gme is most sensitive to changes in our nonperformance risk interest rates and estimates of our employee benefit related obligations gm korea and holden are most sensitive to our determination of whether it is more likely than not that their deferred tax assets will or will not be utilized 

in the future we have an increased likelihood of measuring goodwill for possible impairment during our annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment testing and in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts an eventdriven impairment test is required if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount because our reporting units were recorded at their fair values upon application of freshstart reporting it is more likely a decrease in the fair value of our reporting units from their freshstart reporting values could occur and such a decrease would trigger the need to measure for possible goodwill impairments gme has a negative carrying amount and gm koreas fair value is less than its carrying amount which increases the likelihood of measuring goodwill for further impairment in the nearterm 

upon the application of freshstart reporting goodwill predominately resulted from our recorded liabilities for certain employee benefit obligations being higher than the fair value of these obligations because lower discount rates were utilized in determining the us gaap values compared to those utilized to determine fair values the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of these obligations were based on our incremental borrowing rates which included our nonperformance risk our incremental borrowing rates are also affected by changes in market interest rates further upon the application of freshstart reporting the recorded amounts of our assets were lower than their fair values because of the recording of valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets the difference between these fair valuetous gaap amounts 1 would decrease upon a decrease in credit spreads between high quality corporate bond rates and market interest rates for companies with similar nonperformance risk 2 could decrease upon an improvement in our credit rating thus resulting in a decrease in the spread between our employee benefit related obligations under us gaap and their fair values andor 3 could decrease upon a change in the fair values of our estimated employee benefit obligations a decrease will also occur upon reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances should the fair valuetous gaap differences decrease for these reasons the implied goodwill balance will decline accordingly at the next annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment test to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value or the reporting unit has a negative carrying amount a goodwill impairment could occur future goodwill impairments could also occur should we reorganize our internal reporting structure in a manner that changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units upon such an event goodwill would be reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relativefairvalue allocation approach unless the entity was never integrated and not based on the amount of goodwill that was originally attributable to fair value tous gaap differences that gave rise to goodwill upon application of freshstart reporting 

refer to note 12  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairments including risks of future goodwill impairment charges 

impairment of longlived assets 

the carrying amount of longlived assets and finitelived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated when events and circumstances warrant if the carrying amount of a longlived asset group is considered impaired a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for the asset group to be held and used productspecific 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

longlived assets are tested for impairment at the platform or vehicle line level nonproduct line specific longlived assets are tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis in gmna gme and gm financial and tested at or within our various reporting units within gmio and gmsa segments assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved we develop anticipated cash flows from historical experience and internal business plans a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the longlived asset impairment tests principally in determining the fair value of the asset groups and the assets average estimated useful life while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets could become impaired in the future as a result of declines in profitability due to significant changes in volume pricing or costs 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive sales and revenue and in certain instances as an increase to automotive cost of sales at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives 

policy warranty and recalls 

the estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and the estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events however where little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on longterm historical averages revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

automotive 

we enter into a variety of foreign currency exchange and commodity forward contracts and options to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the risk management committee which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the risk management committee is composed of members of our management and functions under the oversight of the finance and risk committee a committee of the board of directors the finance and risk committee assists and guides the board in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the risk management committee our risk management policy intends to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures 

further information on our exposure to market risk is included in note 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk commodity price risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity prices for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rates and commodity prices change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2011 such contracts have remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2011 our three most significant foreign currency exposures are the eurobritish pound us dollarkorean won and eurokorean won 

  

at december 31 2011 and 2010 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 42 billion and 33  billion this presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 637 million and 513  million at december 31 2011 and 2010 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial position 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gains losses dollars in millions

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities 

at december 31 2011 we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations 

the following table summarizes our automotive debt by fixed rate and variable rate dollars in millions 



at december 31 2011 and 2010 the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 55 billion and 48  billion the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would be 152  million and 166  million at december 31 2011 and 2010 

we invest in marketable securities of various types and maturities the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates our marketable securities portfolio includes marketable securities classified as availableforsale and trading 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had marketable securities of 101  billion and 54  billion classified as availablefor sale with exposure to interest rate risk the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be 28  million and 9  million at december 31 2011 and 2010 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had marketable securities of 60  billion and 107  million classified as trading with exposure to interest rate risk the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be 20  million and 6  million at december 31 2011 and 2010 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in prices of commodities primarily associated with various nonferrous and precious metals for automotive components and energy used in the overall manufacturing process certain commodity purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative we use commodity options to offset our commodity price exposures 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 the net fair value liability asset of commodity derivatives and commodity related embedded derivatives was 11  million and 84  million the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would be 24  million and 47 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 this amount excludes the offsetting effect of the commodity price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

equity price risk 

at december 31 2011 the carrying amount of cost method investments was 439  million of which the carrying amount of our investment in ally financial common stock was 403  million in march 2011 we sold our investment in ally financial preferred stock for net proceeds of 10 billion at december 31 2010 the carrying amount of cost method investments was 17  billion of which the carrying amounts of our investments in ally financial common stock and ally financial preferred stock were 964  million and 665  million these amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss from these investments refer to note 10  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the sale of the ally financial preferred stock 

automotive financing  gm financial 

fluctuations in market interest rates affect gm financials credit facilities and securitization transactions gm financials gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of gm financials dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund purchases of finance receivables 

credit facilities 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities the purchaser of the interest rate cap pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap or strike rate the purchaser of the interest rate cap bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap or strike rate as part of gm financials interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible it may simultaneously enter into a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap and thus retain the interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased is included in gm financial other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold is included in gm financial other liabilities 

securitizations 

in gm financials securitization transactions it transfers fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions gm financial uses interest rate swaps to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by its securitization trusts to a fixed rate pay rate and receive a floating or variable rate receive rate thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by it over the life of a securitization interest rate swaps purchased by gm financial do not affect the amount of cash flows received by holders of the assetbacked securities issued by the trusts the interest rate swaps serve to offset the effect of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate assetbacked securities on the cash flows received from the trusts gm financial utilizes such arrangements to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on risk tolerances its spes are contractually required to 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

purchase a derivative financial instrument to protect the net spread in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities the fair value of the interest rate caps purchased in connection with securitization transactions are included in gm financial other assets and the fair value of the interest rate caps sold are included in gm financial other liabilities changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap derivatives are a component of interest expense recorded in gm financial operating and other expenses 

gm financial has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments on seven of its active securitization transactions portions of these interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedges is included in gm financial other liabilities interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedges are included in gm financial other assets 

the following table summarizes gm financials interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by year of expected maturity and the fair value of those assets and liabilities at december 31 2011 dollars in millions 



the following table summarizes gm financials interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by year of expected maturity and the fair value of those assets and liabilities at december 31 2010 dollars in millions 

general motors company and subsidiaries 



gm financial estimates the realization of financing receivables in future periods using discount rate prepayment and credit loss assumptions similar to its historical experience notional amounts on interest rate swaps and caps are based on contractual terms credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classified based on expected payoff senior notes and convertible senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on maturity 

the notional amounts of interest rate swaps and caps which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and thus are not a measure of gm financials exposure to loss through its use of these derivatives 

gm financial monitors hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk however there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on gm financials profitability gm financial does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes

automotive financing 

on october 1 2010 we completed the acquisition of americredit corp americredit for cash of approximately 35 billion and changed its name to general motors financial company inc 

gm financial is a leading automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992 gm financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships gm financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources the typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700 gm financial services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems since gm financial provides financing in a relatively highrisk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing 

gm financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and securitization trusts that issue assetbacked securities to investors gm financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by gm financial over the life of the securitization excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the assetbacked securities net of credit losses and expenses 

excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the assetbacked securities issued by the securitization trusts once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to gm financial or in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities in addition to excess cash flows gm financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts 

in december 2010 gm financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new gm vehicles gm financial expects to begin offering a nationwide lease product targeting consumers with prime and subprime credit scores in 2011 

competitive position 

information in this 2010 10k relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates of management and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture market share information in this 2010 10k is based on vehicle sales volume 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive the principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price quality available options style safety reliability fuel economy and functionality market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely 

in the year ended december 31 2010 our worldwide market share was 114 our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended december 31 2010 are consistent with a gradual us vehicle sales recovery from the negative economic effects of the us recession first experienced by old gm in the second half of 2008 

in the year ended december 31 2009 combined gm and old gm worldwide market share was 116 in 2009 the us continued to be negatively affected by the economic factors experienced in 2008 as us automotive industry sales declined 214 when compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

in the year ended december 31 2008 old gm’s worldwide market share was 123 in 2008 worldwide market share was severely affected by the recession in old gm’s largest market the us and the recession in western europe tightening of the credit markets increases in the unemployment rate declining consumer confidence as a result of declining household incomes and escalating public

speculation related to old gm’s potential bankruptcy contributed to significantly lower vehicle sales in the us these economic factors had a negative effect on the us automotive industry and the principal factors that determine consumers’ vehicle buying decisions as a result consumers delayed purchasing or leasing new vehicles which caused a decline in us vehicle sales

 product pricing 

a number of methods are used to promote our products including the use of dealer retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support the level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products in 2011 we will continue to price vehicles competitively including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required we believe this strategy coupled with sound inventory management will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices 

cyclical nature of business 

in the automotive industry retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries the market for vehicles is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions credit availability and consumer spending in 2010 the global automotive industry particularly in the us had not yet fully recovered from the negative economic factors experienced in 2008 

relationship with dealers 

we market vehicles worldwide through a network of independent retail dealers and distributors at december 31 2010 there were 4458 vehicle dealers in the us 465 in canada and 244 in mexico and other central american locations additionally there were a total of 15048 distribution outlets throughout the rest of the world these outlets include distributors dealers and authorized sales service and parts outlets 

the following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

as part of achieving and sustaining longterm viability and the viability of our dealer network we determined that a reduction in the number of gmna dealerships was necessary in determining which dealerships would remain in our network we performed analyses of volumes and consumer satisfaction indexes among other criteria refer to the section of this report entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — specific management initiatives — us dealer reduction” for a further discussion on our us dealer reduction 

we enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from a gm approved location our dealers often offer more than one gm brand of vehicle at a single dealership in fact we actively promote this for several of our brands in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability authorized gm dealers offer parts accessories service and repairs for gm vehicles in the product lines that they sell using genuine gm parts and accessories our dealers are authorized to service gm vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with genuine gm parts our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by gm financial ally financial inc formerly gmac inc ally financial and other financial institutions 

because dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the ultimate consumer of our products the quality of gm dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success in addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters

fuel efficiency 

we and old gm have complied with federal fuel economy requirements since their inception in 1978 and we are fully committed to meeting the requirements of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa and compliance with other regulatory schemes including the california vehicle greenhouse gas emissions program we anticipate steadily improving fuel economy for both our car and truck fleets we are committed to meeting or exceeding all federal fuel economy standards in the 2011 through 2016 model years we plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies including 1 extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains 2 increased use of smaller displacement engines and six speed automatic transmissions 3 vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter frontwheel drive architectures 4 increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings and 5 portfolio changes including increasing carcrossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller more fuel efficient offerings 

we are committed to lead in the development of technologies to increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines such as cylinder deactivation direct injection turbocharging with engine downsizing six speed transmissions and variable valve timing as a fullline manufacturer that produces a wide variety of cars trucks and sport utility vehicles we currently offer 13 models 2011 model year obtaining 30 mpg or more in highway driving 

alternative fuel vehicles 

we have been in the forefront in the development of alternative fuel vehicles leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our operations in brazil alternative fuels offer the greatest nearterm potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector especially as cellulosic sources of ethanol become more affordable and readily available in the us 

we currently offer 19 flexfuel vehicles for the 2011 model year estimated to be 40 of our us vehicle sales capable of operating on gasoline e85 ethanol or any combination of the two as part of an overall energy diversity strategy we remain committed to making at least 50 of the vehicles we produce for the us capable of operating on biofuels specifically e85 ethanol by 2012 assuming the appropriate infrastructure growth materializes however recent regulatory developments occurring in the fourth quarter of 2010 have altered our previous flexfuel vehicle production goals beyond 2012 we are currently evaluating the effects of these regulatory developments 

we are focused on promoting sustainable biofuels derived from nonfood sources such as agricultural forestry and municipal waste we are continuing to work with our two strategic alliances with cellulosic ethanol makers coskata inc of warrenville illinois and new hampshire based mascoma corp in october 2009 coskata inc opened its semicommercial facility for manufacturing cellulosic ethanol and mascoma corp has been making cellulosic ethanol at its rome new york demonstration plant since late 2008 

we are supporting the development of biodiesel a cleanburning alternative diesel fuel that is produced from renewable sources in 2011 model year fullsize pickups and vans b20 capability is standard on our duramax 66l turbo diesel engine the duramax diesel engine is available in the chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra heavyduty pickups and chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans 

we have announced that compressed natural gas cng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg powered versions of the chevrolet express and gmc savana fullsize vans will be offered to fleet and commercial customers we are currently accepting orders for the cng cargo vans and the lpg van cutaway models will begin production by the second quarter of 2011 the vans have specially designed engines for the gaseous fuels and come direct to the customer with the fully integrated and warranted dedicated gaseous fuel system in place

the chevrolet volt is an electric vehicle with extended range capability for the first 25 to 50 miles depending on terrain driving technique temperature and battery age the chevrolet volt operates as a fullperformance battery electric vehicle powered only by electricity once the battery is depleted the chevrolet volt’s onboard engine generates the energy needed to power the vehicle over 300 additional miles on a full tank of premium fuel production of the 2011 chevrolet volt began in november 2010 the chevrolet volt arrived in dealerships in select us geographic markets in december 2010 and we plan to have chevrolet volts available in all participating dealerships in the us by the end of 2011 a second electric vehicle with extended range the opel ampera is scheduled to launch in europe in late 2011 

hydrogen fuel cell technology 

as part of our longterm strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology we and old gm have conducted research in hydrogen fuel cell development spanning more than 40 years and we are the only us automobile manufacturer actively engaged in all elements of the fuel cell propulsion system development inhouse our chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs such as project driveway are the largest in the world and have accumulated more than 17 million miles of realworld driving by consumers celebrities business partners and government agencies more than 6500 individuals have driven the fuel cell powered chevrolet equinox either in short drives such as media or special events or as part of project driveway to date their feedback has led to technology improvements such as extending fuel cell stack life and improvements in the regenerative braking system which has also benefited our twomode hybrid vehicles and improvements in the infrastructure of fueling stations for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles the knowledge gained during project driveway on the fuel cell itself has affected the development of the chevrolet volt battery as we are applying fuel cell thermal design knowledge to the chevrolet volt battery design project driveway operates in washington dc and california including los angeles orange county and sacramento for the california fuel cell partnership and the california air resources board carb project driveway also operates in the new york metropolitan area and the greater new york city area with hydrogen fueling stations at jfk international airport and in the bronx most project driveway participants drive chevrolet equinoxes for two months with the cost of fuel and insurance provided free in exchange for participant feedback the chevrolet equinox fuel cell electric vehicles do not use any gasoline or oil and emit only water vapor we have made significant progress on the fuel cell stack for a secondgeneration fuel cell vehicle though we currently have not approved such a program

in 2009 onstar developed an injury severity prediction system based on the findings of a center for disease control and prevention expert panel which allows onstar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants data from onstar’s automatic crash response system will be used to automatically calculate the injury severity prediction which can assist responders in determining the level of care required and the transport destination for patients onstar has also expanded its stolen vehicle assistance services with the announcement of remote ignition block this will allow an onstar advisor to send a remote signal to a subscriber’s stolen vehicle to prevent the vehicle from restarting once the ignition is turned off we believe that this capability will not only help authorities recover stolen vehicles but can also prevent or shorten dangerous high speed pursuits 

other technologies 

other safety systems include the third generation of our stabilitrak electronic stability control system the system maximizes handling and braking by using a combination of systems and sensors including antilock braking systems abs traction control suspension and steering our lane departure warning system and side blind zone alert systems extend and enhance driver awareness and vision 

product development 

our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization this strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development 

under our global vehicle architecture strategy and for each of our ten global architectures we define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces 

a centralized organization is responsible for many of the nonvisible parts of the vehicle such as steering suspension the brake system the heating ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system this team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand such as exterior and interior design tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements 

we currently have ten different global architectures that are assigned to regional centers around the world the allocation of the architectures to specific regions is based on where the expertise for the vehicle segment resides eg mini and small vehicles in asia pacific compact vehicles in europe and midsize crossover and rearwheel drive vehicles in north america we are engineering most of these global architectures to enable various electric propulsion systems rather than having unique architectures for hybrids plugin hybrids extendedrange electric and electric vehicles 

the ten global architectures are 

 

 we plan to increase the volume of vehicles produced from common global architectures to more than 50 of our total volumes in 2015 from less than 17 today

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials parts supplies energy freight transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products the raw materials are primarily composed of steel aluminum resins copper lead and platinum group metals we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements in 2009 the weakening of commodity prices experienced in the latter part of 2008 was generally reversed with prices returning to more historical levels by year end in early 2010 our costs increased further as commodity prices increased faster than expected due to economic growth in china and speculative activity in the commodity markets during the middle part of 2010 there was a slight leveling of commodity prices due to european sovereign debt issues and concerns over a slowdown in china but commodity prices have returned to steady price increases during the last few months of 2010 

in some instances we purchase systems components parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions based on our standard payment terms with our systems components and parts suppliers we are generally required to pay most of these suppliers on average 47 days following receipt with weekly disbursements 

environmental and regulatory matters 

automotive emissions control 

we are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions including vehicle exhaust emission standards vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic system obd requirements in the regions throughout the world in which we sell cars trucks and heavyduty engines 

north america 

the us federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the us and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments most notably california these requirements include preproduction testing of vehicles testing of vehicles after assembly the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to recall and repair customer owned vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements we must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the environmental protection agency epa before we can sell vehicles in the us and canada and from the carb before we can sell vehicles in california and other states that have adopted the california emissions requirements 

the epa and the carb continue to emphasize testing on vehicles sold in the us for compliance with these emissions requirements we believe that our vehicles meet the current epa and carb requirements if our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing or as part of government required defect reporting we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls and possible fines we expect that new carb and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle’s emission performance 

the current epa and the carb emission requirements are referred to as tier 2 and low emission vehicle lev ii fleetwide compliance with the tier 2 and lev ii standards must be achieved based on a salesweighted fleet average president obama has

directed the epa to review its vehicle emission standards and if the epa finds that more stringent emission regulations are necessary to promulgate such regulations the carb is developing its next generation emission standards lev iii which will further increase the stringency of its emission standards we expect the lev iii requirements to be adopted as early as the fourth quarter of 2011 and to be phased in beginning with the 2014 model year both the epa and the carb have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement they are discussed under “automotive fuel economy” 

california law requires that 11 of 2011 model year cars and certain lightduty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles zev such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial zev credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties an additional portion of the zev requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial zev requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as a hybrid electric propulsion system meeting specified criteria beginning in 2012 an additional portion of the zev requirement can be met with phevs that meet the partial zev requirements and certain other criteria we are complying with the zev requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the partial zev requirements carb has also announced plans to adopt as early as the fourth quarter of 2011 2018 model year and later requirements for zevs and phevs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state’s longterm greenhouse gas reduction goals 

the clean air act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the california car and lightduty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements twelve states including new york massachusetts maine vermont connecticut pennsylvania rhode island new jersey oregon washington maryland and new mexico as well as the province of quebec currently have these standards in effect although new mexico has waived its requirements through 2016 effective january 2011 arizona has adopted the california standards effective beginning in the 2012 model year and delaware has adopted those standards beginning in the 2014 model year additional states could also adopt the california standards in the future 

advanced obd systems used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems are required under us federal canadian federal and california law problems detected by the obd system have the potential of increasing warranty costs and the chance for recall obd requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required california has adopted more stringent and technically challenging obd requirements that take effect from the 2008 through 2013 model years including new design requirements and corresponding enforcement procedures we have implemented hardware and software changes to comply with these more stringent requirements 

the federal tier 2 requirements for evaporative emissions are being harmonized with the california evaporative emission requirements beginning with a 2009 model year phasein california plans to further increase the stringency of its evaporative emission requirements as part of its lev iii rulemaking 

vehicles equipped with heavyduty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements and could be recalled or fines could be imposed against us should testing or defect reporting identify a noncompliance with these emission requirements for the 2011 model year certain gasoline and dieselpowered chevrolet silverados gmc sierra pickups chevrolet express and gmc savana vans are classified as heavyduty and subject to these requirements we also certify heavyduty engines for installation in other manufacturers’ products the heavyduty exhaust standards became more stringent in the 2010 model year as permitted by epa and carb regulations we are using a system of credits referred to as averaging banking and trading to help meet these stringent standards obd requirements were first applied to heavyduty vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes 

europe 

in europe emissions are regulated by two different entities the european commission ec and the united nations economic commission for europe un ece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 european

union eu member states and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the un ece eu member states can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date this can result in specific market requirements for automobile manufacturers to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the ec emission standards the current ec requirements include type approval of preproduction testing of vehicles testing of vehicles after assembly and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements ec and un ece requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation we must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and obtain type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the eu member states 

emission requirements in europe will become even more stringent in the future a new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and lightduty trucks euro 5 standards was applied in 2009 while stricter euro 6 standards will apply beginning in 2014 the obd requirements associated with these new standards will become more challenging as well the new european emission standards focus particularly on reducing emissions from diesel vehicles diesel vehicles have become important in the european marketplace where they encompass 50 of the market share the new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines which currently cost more than gasoline engines to comply with euro 6 we expect that we will need to implement technologies which are identical to those being developed to meet us emission standards the technologies available today are not cost effective and would therefore not be suitable for the european market for small and midsize diesel vehicles which typically are under high cost pressure certain measures to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions have detrimental effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy 

in the longterm notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in europe regulatory discussions in europe are expected to continue regulators will continue to refine the testing requirements addressing issues such as test cycle durability obd inservice conformity and offcycle emissions 

international operations 

in our international operations our vehicles are subject to a broad range of vehicle emission laws and regulations china has implemented european emission standards with euro 4 standards first applied in beijing in 2008 shanghai implemented euro 4 standards with european obd requirements for newly registered vehicles in 2009 and euro 4 standards came into effect nationwide in 2010 for new vehicle approvals and will come into effect beginning in 2011 for newly registered vehicles beijing is expected to require many elements of euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles beginning in 2012 with additional elements of euro 5 standards being enforced beginning in 2014 nationwide implementation of euro 5 is expected in 2013 or 2014 south korea has implemented the following 1 carb emission requirements based on a salesweighted fleet average with different application timings and levels of nonmethane organic gas which is the sum of all organic air pollutants excluding methane targets for gasoline and lpg powered vehicles 2 euro 5 standards for dieselpowered vehicles 3 carb standards for gasolinepowered vehicles and 4 eu regulations for dieselpowered vehicles for obd and evaporative emissions the senior representatives from each of the association of southeast asian nations asean committee agreed that the major asean countries of thailand malaysia indonesia philippines and singapore would implement euro 4 standards for gasoline and diesel powertrains with the exception of singapore which already requires euro 4 for diesel powertrains in april 2010 most of the asean countries decided to postpone euro 4 beyond 2012 with the exception of thailand since april 2010 india’s bharat stage iv emission standards have been required for new vehicle registrations in 13 major cities and bharat stage iii emission standards are required throughout the rest of india starting in 2013 eu obd ii will be implemented for all bharat stage iv vehicles roadworthiness requirements in 13 major cities for bharat stage iv vehicles will commence in 2011 japan sets specific exhaust emission and durability standards test methods and driving cycles in japan obd is required with both eu and us obd systems accepted all other countries in which we conduct operations within the asia pacific region either require or allow some form of epa eu or un ece style emission regulations with or without obd requirements in russia current emission regulations are equivalent to euro 3 for cars and euro 2 for commercial vehicles the implementation of euro 4 equivalent emission requirements for cars has been delayed to 2012 euro 5 equivalent emission requirements for cars do not have an implementation date but are expected to be implemented in 2015 australia currently requires a euro 4 equivalent emission standard and is currently considering the implementation of a euro 5 equivalent emission standard

industrial environmental control 

our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions water discharges waste management and environmental cleanup in connection with the 363 sale we have assumed various stages of investigation for sites where contamination has been alleged and a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources 

the future effect of environmental matters including potential liabilities is often difficult to estimate environmental reserves are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable this practice is followed whether the claims are asserted or unasserted at december 31 2010 our reserves for environmental liabilities were 195 million the amount of current reserves is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites which typically range from five to 30 years 

the following table summarizes the expenditures for siteremediation actions including ongoing operations and maintenance dollars in millions 

 

 it is possible that such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of 30 million over the next five years 

certain remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible are not reasonably estimable because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site the involvement of other potentially responsible parties the application of laws and other standards or regulations site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations studies and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent duration and success of remediation as a result we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites although that total could be substantial 

to mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfillfree facilities landfillfree facilities send no manufacturing waste to landfills by either recycling or creating energy from the waste as part of our commitment to reduce the environmental effect resulting from our worldwide facilities our goal was to convert half of our major global manufacturing operations to landfillfree facilities by 2010 in 2010 we achieved this

 in response to a us supreme court decision the epa was directed to establish a new program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles under the clean air act in april 2010 the epa and the nhtsa issued a joint final rule to implement a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for model year 2012 through 2016 lightduty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act and improve fuel economy pursuant to the cafe standards under the epca these reformbased standards apply to 2012 through 2016 model year passenger cars lightduty trucks and mediumduty passenger vehicles collectively lightduty vehicles and will require an industry wide standard of 355 mpg by 2016 our current product plan projects compliance with the federal programs through 2016 

environment canada an agency established to preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment and coordinate environmental policies and programs for the canadian federal government implemented vehicle greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with the mandatory standards of the us beginning with the 2011 model year the province of quebec has indicated that it will align its vehicle greenhouse gas regulation to the canadian federal government requirements once they are finalized 

california has passed legislation ab 1493 requiring the carb to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles which is the same as regulating fuel economy this california program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years california needed a federal waiver to implement this program and was granted this waiver in june 2009

 europe 

in europe legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle co 2 emissions beginning in 2012 based on a target function of co 2 to vehicle weight each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales weighted fleet average target this fleet average requirement will be phased in with 65 of vehicles sold in 2012 required to meet this target 75 in 2013 80 in 2014 and 100 in 2015 and beyond automobile manufacturers can earn supercredits under this legislation for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific co 2 value of less than 50 grams co 2  this is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultralow co 2 vehicles such as the chevrolet volt and opel ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the co 2 fleet average automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for ecoinnovations for those technologies which improve realworld fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle such as solar panels on vehicles there is also a 5 credit for e85 flexfuel vehicles if more than 30 of refueling stations in an eu member state sell e85 further regulatory detail is being developed in the comitology process which develops the detail of the regulatory requirements through a process involving the ec and eu member states the legislation sets a target of 95 grams per kilometer co 2 for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement we have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational co 2 targets for each market entry in europe 

in 2009 the european commission adopted a proposal to regulate co 2 emissions from light commercial vehicles the proposal is modeled after the co 2 regulation for passenger cars it proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average co 2 target of 175 grams per kilometer co 2 with a phasein of compliance beginning with 75 of new light commercial vehicles by 2014 80 by 2015 and 100 compliance by 2016 the manufacturerspecific co 2 compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel vehicle curb weight flexibilities such as ecoinnovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well a longterm target for 2020 of 135gkm has been also proposed to be confirmed in 2013 after an impact assessment we are currently performing an assessment of the effect of the proposal on our fleet of light commercial vehicles the proposal will now go through the legislative process with the european parliament and european council during which we expect some modifications to be adopted 

an ec regulation has been adopted that will require lowrolling resistance tires tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators by 2012 an additional ec regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise fuel efficiency and rolling resistance affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket

chemical regulations 

north america 

in the us the epa and several states have introduced regulations or legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives green chemistry and product stewardship initiatives as have several provinces in canada these initiatives will give broad regulatory authority over the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers’ responsibilities for vehicle lifecycle including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing although vehicles may not specifically be included in the regulations currently being developed automotive sector effects are expected because substances that comprise components may be included these emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in cost and supply chain complexity california’s “safer alternatives for consumer products” was the first of these regulations although implementation requirements have been delayed beyond 2010 

europe 

in 2007 the eu implemented its regulatory requirements to register evaluate authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances reach this regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the european chemicals agency before 2018 during reach’s preregistration phase old gm

and our suppliers registered those substances identified by the regulation reach is to be phased in over a 10 year period during the implementation phase reach will require ongoing action from manufacturers and importers of pure chemical substances chemical preparations mixtures and articles this will affect us as an original equipment manufacturer oem as well as our suppliers and other suppliers in the supply chain under reach substances of very high concern may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future this could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future reach requirements in order to maintain compliance we are continually monitoring the implementation of reach and its effect on our suppliers and the automotive industry 

safety 

new motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment sold in the us are required to meet certain safety standards promulgated by the nhtsa the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966 authorized the nhtsa to determine these standards and the schedule for implementing them in the case of a vehicle defect that creates an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety or if a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy we are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints warranty claims field reports and notices and claims involving property damage injuries and fatalities in the us and claims involving fatalities outside the us as well as information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the us 

we are subject to certain safety standards and recall regulations in the markets outside the us these standards often have the same purpose as the us standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures from time to time other countries pass regulations which are more stringent than us standards many countries require type approval while the us and canada require selfcertification 

vehicular noise control 

vehicles we manufacture and sell may be subject to noise emission regulations 

in the us passenger cars and lightduty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations we are committed to designing and developing our products to meet these noise regulations since addressing different vehicle noise regulations established in numerous state and local jurisdictions is not practical we attempt to identify the most stringent requirements and validate to those requirements in the rare instances where a state or local noise regulation is not covered by the composite requirement a waiver of the requirement is requested and to date the resolution of these matters has not resulted in significant cost or other material adverse effects to us medium to heavyduty trucks are regulated at the federal level federal truck regulations preempt all united states state or local noise regulations for trucks over 10000 lbs gross vehicle weight rating 

outside the us noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level eg ec or un ece for europe we believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold 

while current noise emission regulations serve to regulate maximum allowable noise levels proposals have been made to regulate minimum noise levels these proposals stem from concern that vehicles that are relatively quiet specifically hybrids may not be heard by the sightimpaired in the us the pedestrian safety enhancement act was signed into law in january 2011 which requires nhtsa to study and then issue rulemaking on the minimum safe level of sound for hybrid and electrical vehicles in japan the ministry of land infrastructure and transport has issued guidelines on the performance and nature of any external audible pedestrian alert system if fitted to a vehicle the un ece is evaluating the use of a version of the japanese guideline as an interim measure pending further study we are committed to design and manufacture vehicles to comply with potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals 

potential effect of regulations 

we are actively working on aggressive nearterm and longterm plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities improve fuel efficiency monitor and

enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers this is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of flexfuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles the conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfillfree status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability we believe that the development and global implementation of new costeffective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities 

despite these advanced technology efforts our ability to satisfy fuel economy co 2 and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic consumer legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control and cannot predict with certainty if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements which include higher cafe standards and state co 2 requirements such as those imposed by the ab 1493 rules then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

pension legislation 

we are subject to a variety of federal rules and regulations including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pensions for our retired employees and their spouses the ppa is designed among other things to more appropriately reflect the fair value of pension assets and liabilities in order to determine funding requirements the pension relief act of 2010 provides us with additional options to amortize any shortfall amortization base for us hourly and salaried qualified pension plans over seven years with amortization starting two years after the election of this relief or 15 years while we do not need to make an election at this time we expect to evaluate these options for the 2010 and 2011 plan years in the future we do not have any required contributions in 2011 if we decide to elect one of these options it could provide us with the flexibility to defer and potentially reduce the size of any minimum funding requirements for future years we also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the us which are subject to local laws and regulations 

export control 

we are subject to us export control laws and regulations including those administered by the us departments of state commerce and treasury most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls our office of export compliance and global export compliance officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nonus export controls are likely to become increasingly significant to our business as we develop our research and development operations on a global basis if we fail to comply with applicable export compliance regulations we and our employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and under certain circumstances loss of export privileges and debarment from doing business with the us government and the governments of other countries

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below while we describe each risk separately some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 

our business is highly dependent on sales volume global vehicle sales have declined significantly from their peak levels and there is no assurance that the global automobile market will recover in the near future or that it will not suffer a significant further downturn 

our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume as demonstrated by the effect of sharp declines in vehicle sales on our and old gm’s business in the us since 2007 and globally since 2008 vehicle sales in the us have fallen significantly on an annualized basis since their peak in 2007 and sales globally have shown steep declines on an annualized basis since their peak in january 2008 many of the economic and market conditions that drove the drop in vehicle sales including declines in real estate values unemployment tightened credit markets depressed consumer confidence and weak housing markets continue to affect sales recent concerns over levels of sovereign indebtedness have contributed to a renewed tightening of credit markets in some of the markets in which we do business although vehicle sales began to recover in certain of our markets in the three months ended december 31 2009 and the recovery has continued through december 31 2010 the recovery in vehicle sales in certain of our markets including north america has been proceeding slowly and there is no assurance that this recovery in vehicle sales will continue or spread across all our markets further sales volumes may again decline severely or take longer to recover than we expect and if they do our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 

our ability to change public perception of our company and products is essential to our ability to attract a sufficient number of consumers to consider our vehicles particularly our new products which is critical to our ability to achieve longterm profitability 

our ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle the automotive industry particularly in the us is very competitive and our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead as is reflected by our loss of market share over the past three years we believe that this is due in part to a negative public perception of our products in relation to those of some of our competitors changing this perception including with respect to the fuel efficiency of our products as well as the perception of our company in light of old gm’s bankruptcy and our status as a recipient of aid under the troubled asset relief program tarp will be critical to our longterm profitability if we are unable to change public perception of our company and products especially our new products including cars and crossovers our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand 

volatile oil prices in 2008 and 2009 contributed to weaker demand for some of old gm’s and our higher margin vehicles especially our fullsize sport utility vehicles as consumer demand shifted to smaller more fuelefficient vehicles which provide lower profit margins and in recent years represented a smaller proportion of old gm’s and our sales volume in north america fullsize pickup trucks which are generally less fuel efficient than smaller vehicles represented a higher percentage of old gm’s and our north american sales during 2008 and 2009 compared to the total industry average percentage of fullsize pickup truck sales in those periods demand for traditional sport utility vehicles and vans also declined during the same periods any increases in the price of oil in the us or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil including as a result of political instability in the middle east and african nations could weaken the demand for such vehicles which could reduce our market share in affected markets decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business 

the pace of introduction and market acceptance of new vehicles is important to our success and the frequency of new vehicle introductions and vehicle improvements may be materially adversely affected by reductions in capital expenditures 

our competitors have introduced new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations and will continue to do so our profit margins sales volumes and market shares may decrease if we are unable to produce models that compare favorably 

  

confidential 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

to these competing models if we are unable to produce new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors including models of smaller vehicles demand for our vehicles may be materially adversely affected further the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that were made in the past or that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations going forward which may materially reduce demand for our vehicles 

our future competitiveness and ability to achieve longterm profitability depends on our ability to control our costs which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations 

we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives for our european operations our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations especially in north america and europe while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control others such as interest rates or return on investments which influence our expense for pensions depend more on external factors and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our structural costs reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase 

failure of our suppliers due to difficult economic conditions affecting our industry to provide us with the systems components and parts that we need to manufacture our automotive products and operate our business could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on many suppliers to provide us with the systems components and parts that we need to manufacture our automotive products and operate our business in recent years a number of these suppliers have experienced severe financial difficulties and solvency problems and some have sought relief under the bankruptcy code or similar reorganization laws this trend intensified in 2009 due to the combination of general economic weakness sharply declining vehicle sales and tightened credit availability that has affected the automotive industry generally suppliers may encounter difficulties in obtaining credit or may receive an opinion from their independent public accountants regarding their financial statements that includes a statement expressing substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern which could trigger defaults under their financings or other agreements or impede their ability to raise new funds 

when comparable situations have occurred in the past suppliers have attempted to increase their prices pass through increased costs alter payment terms or seek other relief in instances where suppliers have not been able to generate sufficient additional revenues or obtain the additional financing they need to continue their operations either through private sources or government funding which may not be available some have been forced to reduce their output shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection such actions would likely increase our costs create challenges to meeting our quality objectives and in some cases make it difficult for us to continue production of certain vehicles to the extent we take steps in such cases to help key suppliers remain in business our liquidity would be adversely affected it may also be difficult to find a replacement for certain suppliers without significant delay 

increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business including steel nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper and precious metals such as platinum and palladium the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices some of these raw materials such as corrosionresistant steel are only available from a limited number of suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to

maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent 

we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results 

the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements providing subsidized financing or leasing programs offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entrylevel automobiles these actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating results and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle 

our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances 

designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements large oems are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale we believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances which could adversely affect our competitiveness with respect to those competitors competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position which could also materially adversely affect our business 

our business plan and other obligations require substantial liquidity and inadequate cash flow could materially adversely affect our financial condition and future business operations 

we will require substantial liquidity to support our business plan and meet other funding requirements we expect total engineering and capital spending of 150 billion in 2011 as we continue to refresh and broaden our product portfolio increase our sales and develop advanced technologies with continued substantial expenditures on engineering and capital spending in subsequent years at december 31 2010 we have debt maturities and capital lease obligations of 99 billion through 2015 which include gm financial we also anticipate continued expenditures to implement longterm cost savings and restructuring plans including our opelvauxhall restructuring plan in addition to the foregoing liquidity needs we also have minimum liquidity covenants in our secured revolving credit facility which require us to maintain at least 40 billion in consolidated global liquidity and at least 20 billion in consolidated us liquidity refer to “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” for a further discussion of these liquidity requirements 

if our liquidity levels approach the minimum liquidity levels necessary to support our normal business operations we may be forced to raise additional capital on terms that may not be favorable curtail engineering and capital spending and reduce research and development and other programs that are important to the future success of our business a reduction in engineering and capital and research and development spending would negatively affect our ability to meet planned product launches and to refresh our product lineup at the pace contemplated in our business plan if this were to happen our future revenue and profitability could be negatively affected 

although we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to operate our business our ability to maintain adequate liquidity over the longterm will depend significantly on the volume mix and quality of our vehicle sales and our ability to minimize operating expenses our liquidity needs are sensitive to changes in each of these and other factors

as part of our business plan we have reduced compensation for our most highly paid executives and have reduced the number of our management and nonmanagement salaried employees and these actions may materially adversely affect our ability to hire and retain salaried employees 

as part of the cost reduction initiatives in our business plan and pursuant to the direction of the special master for tarp executive compensation the special master the form and timing of the compensation for our most highly paid executives is not competitive with that offered by other major corporations furthermore while we have repaid in full our indebtedness under the ust credit agreement the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of section 111 of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa including the interim final rule implementing section 111 the interim final rule will continue to apply to us for the period specified in the eesa and the interim final rule certain of the covenants in the ust credit agreement will continue to apply to us until the earlier to occur of 1 us ceasing to be a recipient of exceptional financial assistance as determined pursuant to the interim final rule or any successor or final rule or 2 ust ceasing to own any direct or indirect equity interests in us the effect of section 111 of eesa the interim final rule and the covenants is to restrict the compensation that we can provide to our top executives and prohibit certain types of compensation or benefits for any employees at the same time we have substantially decreased the number of salaried employees so that the workload is shared among fewer employees and in general the demands on each salaried employee are increased companies in similar situations have experienced significant difficulties in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees particularly in competitive specialties given our compensation structure and increasing job demands there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire and retain the employees whose expertise is required to execute our business plan while at the same time developing and producing vehicles that will stimulate demand for our products 

our plan to reduce the number of our retail channels and brands and to consolidate our dealer network may reduce our total sales volume and our market share and not result in the cost savings we anticipate 

as part of our business plan we will focus our resources in the us on four brands chevrolet cadillac buick and gmc we completed the sale of saab in february 2010 and saab gb in may 2010 and have completed the wind down of our pontiac saturn and hummer brands we have recently completed the federal arbitration process concerning dealer reinstatement and at december 31 2010 we have reduced the total number of our us dealerships to 4500 we anticipate that this reduction in retail outlets brands and dealers will result in cost savings over time but there is no assurance that we will realize all the savings expected we also anticipate our sales volume and market share will increase over time but it is also possible that our market share could decline in the shortterm and beyond because of these reductions in brands and dealers which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries but we may not succeed in doing so and our failure to restructure these operations in a costeffective and nondisruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various european countries and we are actively working to accomplish this restructurings whether or not ultimately successful can involve significant expense and disruption to the business as well as labor disruptions which can adversely affect the business the restructuring of our european operations will require us to invest additional funds and require significant management attention in september 2010 we committed up to 42 billion through an intercompany facility and equity commitments to fund this restructuring and opelvauxhall’s ongoing cash requirements we cannot assure you that any of our contemplated restructurings will be completed or achieve the desired results and if we cannot successfully complete such restructurings we may choose to or the directors of the relevant entity may be compelled to or creditors may force us to seek relief for our various european operations under applicable local bankruptcy reorganization insolvency or similar laws where we may lose control over the outcome of the restructuring process due to the appointment of a local receiver trustee or administrator or similar official or otherwise and which could result in a liquidation and us losing all or a substantial part of our interest in the business

our us defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding obligations could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors including weak performance of financial markets declining interest rates investment decisions that do not achieve adequate returns and investment risk inherent in our investment portfolio 

our future funding obligations for our us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service irs depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is shown in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments due to old gm’s contributions to the plans and to the strong performance of these assets during prior periods the us hourly and salaried pension plans were consistently overfunded from 2005 through 2007 which allowed old gm to maintain a surplus without making additional contributions to the plans however the funded status subsequently deteriorated due to a combination of factors adverse equity and credit markets reduced the market value of plan assets while the present value of pension liabilities rose significantly in response to declines in the discount rate the effect of separation programs and increases in the level of pension benefits and number of beneficiaries this increase in beneficiaries was partially due to the inclusion of certain delphi hourly employees as a result of these adverse factors our us defined benefit pension plans were underfunded on a us gaap basis by 124 billion at december 31 2010 

the defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate in the us in the year ended december 31 2010 interest rates on high quality corporate bonds decreased 

the next pension funding valuation to be prepared based on the requirements of the ppa will be as of october 1 2010 in december 2010 we made a 40 billion cash contribution to our us hourly and salaried pension plans and in january 2011 we contributed 61 million shares of our common stock to our us hourly and salaried pension plans valued at 22 billion for funding purposes the contributed shares qualify as a plan asset for funding purposes immediately and will qualify as a plan asset for accounting purposes when certain restrictions are removed which is expected in 2011 a hypothetical funding valuation at december 31 2010 using the 3segment rate at may 31 2010 for the funding valuation of the plan year beginning october 1 2010 and assuming the december 31 2010 full yield curve funding interest rate for all future funding valuations projects contributions of 23 billion and 12 billion in 2015 and 2016 our potential funding requirements are described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities” 

if the total values of the assets held by our pension plans decline andor the returns on such assets underperform our return assumptions our pension expenses would generally increase and could materially adversely affect our financial position changes in interest rates that are not offset by contributions asset returns andor hedging activities could also increase our obligations under such plans if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds which would negatively affect our cash flow at december 31 2010 our nonus defined benefit pension plans were underfunded on a us gaap basis by 98 billion 

due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments additional risks exist examples include significant changes in investment policy insufficient market capacity to complete a particular investment strategy and an inherent divergence in objectives between the ability to manage risk in the short term and inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and longterm investments 

if we are unable to meet our required funding obligations for our us pension plans under the terms imposed by regulators at a given point in time we would need to request a funding waiver from the irs if the waiver were granted we would have the opportunity to make up the missed funding with interest to the plan additional periods of missed funding could further reduce the plans’ funded status resulting in limitations on plan amendments and lump sum payouts from the plans continued deterioration in the plans’ funded status could result in benefit accrual elimination these actions could materially adversely affect our relations with our employees and their labor unions

if adequate financing on acceptable terms is not available through ally financial or other sources to our customers and dealers distributors and suppliers to enable them to continue their business relationships with us our business could be materially adversely affected 

our customers and dealers require financing to purchase a significant percentage of our global vehicle sales historically ally financial has provided most of the financing for our and old gm’s dealers and a significant amount of financing for our and old gm’s customers due to recent conditions in credit markets particularly later in 2008 retail customers and dealers experienced severe difficulty in accessing the credit markets as a result the number of vehicles sold or leased declined rapidly in the second half of 2008 with lease contract volume dropping significantly by the end of 2008 this had a significant adverse effect on old gm vehicle sales overall because many of its competitors had captive financing subsidiaries that were better capitalized than ally financial during 2008 and 2009 and thus were able to offer consumers subsidized financing and leasing offers 

similarly the reduced availability of ally financial wholesale dealer financing in the second half of 2008 and 2009 the increased cost of such financing and the limited availability of other sources of dealer financing due to the general weakness of the credit market has caused and may continue to cause dealers to modify their plans to purchase vehicles from us 

because of recent modifications to our commercial agreements with ally financial ally financial no longer is subject to contractual wholesale funding commitments or retail underwriting targets in addition ally financial’s credit rating has declined in recent years this may negatively affect its access to funding and therefore its ability to provide adequate financing at competitive rates to our customers and dealers a number of other factors could negatively affect ally financial’s business and financial condition and therefore its ability to provide adequate financing at competitive rates these factors include regulations to which ally financial is subject as a result of its bank holding company status disruptions in ally financial’s funding sources and access to credit markets ally financial’s significant indebtedness adverse conditions in the residential mortgage market and housing markets that have adversely affected ally financial because of its mortgage business increases or decreases in interest rates changes in currency exchange rates and fluctuations in valuations of investment securities held by ally financial 

our failure to successfully develop our own captive financing unit including through gm financial could leave us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have their own captive financing subsidiaries and that therefore may be able to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing on better terms than our customers and dealers are able to obtain 

many of our competitors operate and control their own captive financing subsidiaries if any of our competitors with captive financing subsidiaries are able to continue to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing on better terms than our customers and dealers are able to obtain consumers may be more inclined to purchase our competitors’ vehicles and our competitors’ dealers may be better able to stock our competitors’ products 

on october 1 2010 we completed our acquisition of americredit which we subsequently renamed general motors financial company inc through which we offer leasing and subprime financing for our customers our failure to successfully develop our own captive financing unit including through gm financial could result in our loss of customers to our competitors with their own captive financing subsidiaries and could adversely affect our dealers’ ability to stock our vehicles if they are not able to obtain necessary financing at competitive rates from other sources 

we intend to rely on our new captive financing unit gm financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring subprime vehicle financing and gm financial faces a number of business economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

gm financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles because we intend to rely on gm financial to serve as an additional source of leasing and subprime financing options for consumers any impairment of gm financial’s ability to provide such leasing or subprime financing would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration

among consumers who rely on leasing and subprime financing options to acquire new vehicles the factors that could adversely affect gm financial’s business and operations and impair its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing at competitive rates include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the above factors alone or in combination could negatively affect gm financial’s business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and subprime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles 

the ust or its designee owns a substantial interest in us and its interests may differ from those of our other stockholders 

the ust owns 320 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of february 15 2011 as a result of this stock ownership interest the ust has the ability to exert significant influence through its power to vote for the election of our directors over various matters to the extent the ust elects to exert such significant influence over us its interests as a government entity may differ from those of our other stockholders and it may influence through its ability to vote for the election of our directors matters including 

 

  

  

  

 in particular the ust may have a greater interest in promoting us economic growth and jobs than other stockholders of the company for example while we have repaid in full our indebtedness under the ust credit agreement a covenant that continues to apply until the earlier of december 31 2014 or the ust has been paid in full the total amount of all ust invested capital requires that we use our commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure subject to exceptions that our manufacturing volume in the united states is consistent with specified benchmarks 

in the future we may also become subject to new and additional laws and government regulations regarding various aspects of our business as a result of participation in the tarp program and the us government’s ownership in our business these regulations could make it more difficult for us to compete with other companies that are not subject to similar regulations 

our secured revolving credit facility as well as the ust credit agreement and the canadian loan agreement contain significant covenants that may restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to take actions management believes are important to our longterm strategy 

our secured revolving credit facility contains representations warranties and covenants customary for facilities of its nature including negative covenants restricting us from incurring liens consummating mergers or sales of assets and incurring secured

indebtedness and restricting us from making certain payments in each case subject to exceptions and limitations availability under the secured revolving credit facility is subject to borrowing base limitations the secured revolving credit facility contains minimum liquidity covenants which require us to maintain at least 40 billion in consolidated global liquidity and at least 20 billion in consolidated us liquidity 

while we have repaid in full our indebtedness under the ust credit agreement the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of section 111 of the eesa including the interim final rule will continue to apply to us for the period specified in the eesa and the interim final rule certain of the covenants in the ust credit agreement will continue to apply to us until the earlier to occur of 1 us ceasing to be a recipient of exceptional financial assistance as determined pursuant to the interim final rule or any successor or final rule or 2 ust ceasing to own any direct or indirect equity interests in us the effect of section 111 of eesa the interim final rule and the covenants is to restrict the compensation that we can provide to our top executives and prohibit certain types of compensation or benefits for any employees similarly covenants in our whollyowned subsidiary gmcl’s canadian loan agreement with the edc limit compensation and benefits for canadian employees 

the ust credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to use our commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that our manufacturing volume conducted in the united states is consistent with at least 90 of the projected manufacturing level projected manufacturing level for this purpose being 1934000 units in 2011 1998000 units in 2012 2156000 units in 2013 and 2260000 units in 2014 absent a material adverse change in our business or operating environment which would make the commitment noneconomic in the event that such a material adverse change occurs the ust credit agreement provides that we will use commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that the volume of united states manufacturing is the minimum variance from the projected manufacturing level that is consistent with good business judgment and the intent of the commitment this covenant survives our repayment of the ust loans and remains in effect through december 31 2014 unless the ust receives total proceeds from debt repayments dividends interest preferred stock redemptions and common stock sales equal to the total dollar amount of all ust invested capital 

ust invested capital totaled 495 billion representing the cumulative amount of cash received by old gm from the ust under the ust loan agreement and the dip facility excluding 361 million which the ust loaned to old gm under the warranty program and which was repaid on july 10 2009 this balance also did not include amounts advanced under the ust ally financial loan as the ust exercised its option to convert this loan into ally financial preferred membership interests previously held by old gm in may 2009 at december 31 2010 the ust had received cumulative proceeds of 231 billion from debt repayments interest payments series a preferred stock dividends the series a preferred stock redemption and proceeds from the sale of common stock the ust’s invested capital less proceeds received totals 264 billion 

to the extent we fail to comply with any of the covenants in the ust credit agreement that continue to apply to us the ust is entitled to seek specific performance and the appointment of a courtordered monitor acceptable to the ust at our sole expense to ensure compliance with those covenants compliance with the manufacturing volume covenant could require us to increase production volumes in our us plants shift production from lowcost locations to the us or refrain from shifting production from us plants to lowcost locations 

the canadian loan agreement and related agreements include certain covenants requiring gmcl to meet certain annual canadian production volumes expressed as ratios to total overall production volumes in the us and canada and to overall production volumes in the north american free trade agreement nafta region the targets cover vehicles and specified engine and transmission production in canada these agreements also include covenants on annual gmcl capital expenditures and research and development expenses in the event a material adverse change occurs that makes the fulfillment of these covenants noneconomic other than a material adverse change caused by the actions or inactions of gmcl there is an undertaking that the lender will consider adjustments to mitigate the business effect of the material adverse change these covenants survive gmcl’s repayment of the loans and certain of the covenants have effect through december 31 2016 

compliance with the covenants contained in our secured revolving credit facility as well as the surviving provisions of the ust credit agreement and the canadian loan agreement could restrict our ability to take actions that management believes are important to our

longterm strategy if strategic transactions we wish to undertake are prohibited our ability to execute our longterm strategy could be materially adversely affected furthermore monitoring and certifying our compliance with the surviving provisions of the ust credit agreement and the canadian loan agreement requires a high level of expense and management attention on a continuing basis 

our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and even if funded at anticipated levels may not result in successful vehicle applications 

we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2011 and 2012 largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles consistent with our announced objective of being recognized as the industry leader in fuel efficiency moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the liquidity we anticipate we may be forced to reduce delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology 

in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers for example in november 2010 we began producing the chevrolet volt an electric car which requires battery technology that has not yet proven to be commercially viable there can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies however our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies in some cases with more money available and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions or changes in existing ones may have a significant effect on how we do business 

we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations and the related costs and changes to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future in the us and europe for example governmental regulation is primarily driven by concerns about the environment including greenhouse gas emissions vehicle safety fuel economy and energy security these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs including civil penalties they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which can affect revenue 

cafe provisions in the eisa mandate fuel economy standards beginning in the 2011 model year that would increase to at least 35 mpg by 2020 on a combined car and truck fleet basis a 40 increase over current levels california is implementing ab 1493 which will require increased fuel economy this california program has standards currently established for the 2009 model year through the 2016 model year fourteen additional states and the province of quebec have also adopted the california greenhouse gas standards 

in may 2009 president obama announced his intention for the federal government to implement a harmonized federal program to regulate fuel economy and greenhouse gases he directed the epa and the united states department of transportation dot to work together to create standards through a joint rulemaking for control of emissions of greenhouse gases and for fuel economy in the first phase these standards would apply to passenger cars lightduty trucks and mediumduty passenger vehicles built in model years 2012 through 2016 carb has agreed that compliance with epa’s greenhouse gas standards will be deemed compliance with the california greenhouse gas standards for the 2012 through 2016 model years the epa and the nhtsa on behalf of dot issued their final rule to implement this new federal program in april 2010 we have committed to work with epa the nhtsa the states and other stakeholders in support of a strong national program to reduce oil consumption and address global climate change 

we are committed to meeting or exceeding these regulatory requirements and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated federal program through the 2016 model year we expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to

sell a significant volume of hybrid or electrically powered vehicles throughout the us as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines all at increased cost levels there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs 

the eu passed legislation effective in april 2009 to begin regulating vehicle co 2 emissions beginning in 2012 the legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020 with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells additional measures have been proposed or adopted in europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance vehicle air conditioners tire pressure monitors gear shift indicators and others at the national level 17 eu member states have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxidebased vehicle taxation system which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the eu emissions standards 

other governments around the world such as canada south korea and china are also creating new policies to address these same issues as in the us these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance the regulations will result in substantial costs which could be difficult to pass through to our customers and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them which could affect our operations including facility closings reduced employment increased costs and loss of revenue 

a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 

many of our operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as sgm in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be materially adversely affected the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions in our labor agreements could limit our ability to pursue or achieve cost savings through restructuring initiatives and labor strikes work stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations 

substantially all of the hourly employees in our us canadian and european automotive operations are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements which usually have a multiyear duration many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings from restructuring initiatives such as plant closings and reductions in workforce our current collective bargaining agreement with the uaw will expire in september 2011 and while the uaw has agreed to a commitment not to strike prior to 2015 any uaw strikes threats of strikes or other resistance in the future could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production

efficiencies in furtherance of our north american initiatives a lengthy strike by the uaw that involves all or a significant portion of our manufacturing facilities in the united states would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition particularly our liquidity 

despite the formation of our new company we continue to have indebtedness and other obligations our obligations together with our cash needs may require us to seek additional financing minimize capital expenditures or seek to refinance some or all of our debt 

despite the formation of our new company we continue to have indebtedness and other obligations including significant liabilities to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans our current and future indebtedness and other obligations could have several important consequences for example they could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 future liquidity needs may require us to seek additional financing or minimize capital expenditures there is no assurance that either of these alternatives would be available to us on satisfactory terms or on terms that would not require us to renegotiate the terms and conditions of our existing debt agreements 

our failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our present and future indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

several of the agreements governing our indebtedness including our secured revolving credit facility and other loan facility agreements contain covenants requiring us to take certain actions and negative covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions in the past we have failed to meet certain of these covenants including by failing to provide financial statements in a timely manner and failing certain financial tests the chapter 11 proceedings and the change in control as a result of the 363 sale triggered technical defaults in certain loans for which we had assumed the obligations a breach of any of the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness if uncured could lead to an event of default under any such agreements which in some circumstances could give the lender the right to demand that we accelerate repayment of amounts due under the agreement therefore in the event of any such breach we may need to seek covenant waivers or amendments from the lenders or to seek alternative or additional sources of financing and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments or alternative or additional financing on acceptable terms if at all refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on technical defaults and covenant violations any covenant breach or event of default could harm our credit rating and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 

the ability of our new executive management team to quickly learn the automotive industry and lead our company will be critical to our ability to succeed and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if they are unsuccessful 

we have substantially changed our executive management team in the recent past we have a new chief executive officer who started on september 1 2010 and a new chief financial officer who started on january 1 2010 both of whom have no prior outside

automotive industry experience we have also promoted from within gm many new senior officers it is important to our success that the new members of the executive management team quickly understand the automotive industry and that our senior officers quickly adapt and excel in their new senior management roles if they are unable to do so and as a result are unable to provide effective guidance and leadership our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange and other rates 

given the nature and global spread of our business we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can have material adverse effects on our business for example at times certain of our competitors have derived competitive advantage from relative weakness of the japanese yen through pricing advantages for vehicles and parts imported from japan to markets with more robust currencies like the us and western europe similarly a significant strengthening of the korean won relative to the us dollar or the euro would affect the competitiveness of our korean operations as well as that of certain korean competitors as yet another example a relative weakness of the british pound compared to the euro has an adverse effect on our results of operations in europe in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the us into us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date as a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our businesses outside the us expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business 

the majority of our vehicle sales are generated outside the us we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the us operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the effects of these risks may individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our business 

new laws regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards or changes in existing ones may have a significant negative effect on how we do business 

our products must satisfy legal safety requirements meeting or exceeding governmentmandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards while we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to reduce costs and lead times unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development testing and manufacturing governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product

the costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business 

from time to time we recall our products to address performance compliance or safetyrelated issues the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above 

the sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our common stock price to decline or impair our ability to raise capital 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that large sales could occur or the conversion of shares of our series b preferred stock or the perception that conversion could occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity and equityrelated securities at february 15 2011 there are 1560743059 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at february 15 2011 mlc holds a warrant to acquire 136363636 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 1000 per share mlc holds another warrant to acquire 136363636 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 1833 per share and the uaw retiree medical benefits trust new veba holds a warrant to acquire 45454545 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 4231 per share up to 151520000 shares of common stock subject to antidilution makewhole and other adjustments will be issuable upon conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock outstanding at february 15 2011 

of the 1560743059 outstanding shares of common stock at february 15 2011 the 549700000 shares of common stock sold in the november and december 2010 public offering are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act unless those shares are held by any of our “affiliates” as that term is defined under rule 144 of the securities act following the expiration of the applicable lockup periods on may 13 2011 the 950300000 outstanding shares of common stock held by the ust canada holdings the new veba and mlc at february 15 2011 may be eligible for resale under rule 144 under the securities act subject to applicable restrictions under rule 144 in addition pursuant to the october 15 2009 equity registration rights agreement we entered into with the ust canada holdings the new veba mlc and our previous legal entity prior to our october 2009 holding company reorganization which is now a whollyowned subsidiary of the company equity registration rights agreement we have granted each of the ust canada holdings the new veba and mlc the right to require us in certain circumstances to file registration statements under the securities act covering additional resales of our common stock and other equity securities including the warrants held by them and the right to participate in other registered offerings in certain circumstances as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights or otherwise sell their shares the market price of our common stock could decline 

in particular the ust canada holdings the new veba and mlc might sell a large number of the shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire our common stock that they hold or in the case of the new veba and mlc exercise their warrants and then sell the underlying shares of our common stock further mlc might distribute shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire our common stock that it holds to its numerous creditors and other stakeholders pursuant to a plan of reorganization confirmed by the bankruptcy court in the chapter 11 proceedings and those creditors and other stakeholders might resell those shares and warrants such sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or warrants could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

furthermore on january 13 2011 we contributed 60606061 shares of our common stock to our us hourly and salaried pension plans the contributed shares qualify as a plan asset for funding purposes immediately and will qualify as a plan asset for accounting purposes when certain restrictions are removed which is expected in 2011 in connection with such contribution we entered into a registration rights agreement dated january 13 2011 with subtrusts established under the us hourly and salaried pension plans pension plan registration rights agreement whereby we granted the pension plans the right to require us in certain circumstances

chapter 11 proceedings and the 363 sale 

background 

over time as old gm’s market share declined in north america old gm needed to continually restructure its business operations to reduce cost and excess capacity legacy labor costs and obligations and capacity in its dealer network made old gm less competitive than new entrants into the us market these factors continued to strain old gm’s liquidity in 2005 old gm incurred significant losses from operations and from restructuring activities such as providing support to delphi and other efforts intended to reduce operating costs old gm managed its liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives capital markets transactions and sales of assets however the global credit market crisis had a dramatic effect on old gm and the automotive industry in the second half of 2008 the increased turmoil in the mortgage and overall credit markets particularly the lack of financing for buyers or lessees of vehicles the continued reductions in us housing values the volatility in the price of oil recessions in the united states and western europe and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world created a substantially more difficult business environment the ability to execute capital markets transactions or sales of assets was extremely limited vehicle sales in north america and western europe contracted severely and the pace of vehicle sales in the rest of the world slowed old gm’s liquidity position as well as its operating performance were negatively affected by these economic and industry conditions and by other financial and business factors many of which were beyond its control 

as a result of these economic conditions and the rapid decline in sales in the three months ended december 31 2008 old gm determined that despite the actions it had then taken to restructure its us business it would be unable to pay its obligations in the normal course of business in 2009 or service its debt in a timely fashion which required the development of a new plan that depended on financial assistance from the us government 

in december 2008 old gm requested and received financial assistance from the us government and entered into the ust loan agreement in early 2009 old gm’s business results and liquidity continued to deteriorate and as a result old gm obtained additional funding from the ust under the ust loan agreement old gm through its whollyowned subsidiary gmcl also received funding from edc a corporation whollyowned by the government of canada under a loan and security agreement entered into in april 2009 edc loan facility 

as a condition to obtaining the ust loan facility under the ust loan agreement old gm was required to submit a viability plan in february 2009 that included specific actions intended to result in the following

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

the ust loan agreement also required old gm to among other things use its best efforts to achieve the following restructuring targets 

debt reduction 

 

 labor modifications 

 

  

  

 veba modifications 

 

 the ust loan agreement provided that if by march 31 2009 or a later date not to exceed 30 days after march 31 2009 as determined by the presidential task force on the auto industry auto task force certification deadline the auto task force had not certified that old gm had taken all steps necessary to achieve and sustain its longterm viability international competitiveness and energy efficiency in accordance with the viability plan then the loans and other obligations under the ust loan agreement were to become due and payable on the thirtieth day after the certification deadline 

on march 30 2009 the auto task force determined that the plan was not viable and required substantial revisions in conjunction with the march 30 2009 announcement the administration announced that it would offer old gm adequate working capital financing for a period of 60 days while it worked with old gm to develop and implement a more accelerated and aggressive restructuring that would provide a sound longterm foundation on march 31 2009 old gm and the ust agreed to postpone the certification deadline to june 1 2009 

old gm made further modifications to its viability plan in an attempt to satisfy the auto task force requirement that it undertake a substantially more accelerated and aggressive restructuring plan revised viability plan the following is a summary of significant cost reduction and restructuring actions contemplated by the revised viability plan the most significant of which included reducing old gm’s indebtedness and veba obligations 

indebtedness and veba obligations 

in april 2009 old gm commenced exchange offers for certain unsecured notes to reduce its unsecured debt in order to comply with the debt reduction condition of the ust loan agreement

old gm also commenced discussions with the ust regarding the terms of a potential restructuring of its debt obligations under the ust loan agreement the ust ally financial loan agreement as subsequently defined and any other debt issued or owed to the ust in connection with those loan agreements pursuant to which the ust would exchange at least 50 of the total outstanding debt old gm owed to it at june 1 2009 for old gm common stock 

old gm commenced discussions with the uaw and the vebasettlement class representative regarding the terms of potential veba modifications 

other cost reduction and restructuring actions 

in addition to the efforts to reduce debt and modify the veba obligations the revised viability plan also contemplated the following cost reduction efforts 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 old gm had previously announced that it would reduce salaried employment levels on a global basis by 10000 during 2009 and had instituted several programs to effect reductions in salaried employment levels old gm had also negotiated a revised labor agreement with the caw to reduce its hourly labor costs to approximately the level paid to the transplant automakers however such agreement was contingent upon receiving longer term financial support for its canadian operations from the canadian federal and ontario provincial governments 

chapter 11 proceedings 

old gm was not able to complete the cost reduction and restructuring actions in its revised viability plan including the debt reductions and veba modifications which resulted in extreme liquidity constraints as a result on june 1 2009 old gm and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into the chapter 11 proceedings 

in connection with the chapter 11 proceedings old gm entered into a secured superpriority debtorinpossession credit agreement with the ust and edc dip facility and received additional funding commitments from edc to support old gm’s canadian operations

 363 sale 

on july 10 2009 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the sellers the 363 sale was consummated in accordance with the purchase agreement between us and the sellers and pursuant to the bankruptcy court’s sale order dated july 5 2009 

in connection with the 363 sale the purchase price we paid to old gm equaled the sum of 

 

  

  

  

 under the purchase agreement we are obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to mlc adjustment shares in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against mlc as estimated by the bankruptcy court exceed 350 billion the maximum number of adjustment shares issuable is 30 million shares subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends stock splits and other transactions the number of adjustment shares to be issued is calculated based on the extent to which estimated general unsecured claims exceed 350 billion with the maximum number of adjustment shares issued if estimated general unsecured claims total 420 billion or more in the period july 10 2009 to december 31 2009 we determined that it was probable that general unsecured claims allowed against mlc would ultimately exceed 350 billion by at least 20 billion in the circumstance where expected general unsecured claims equal 370 billion we would have been required to issue 86 million adjustment shares to

at december 31 2009 we accounted for the termination of our uaw hourly retiree medical plan and mitigation plan as a settlement the resulting settlement loss of 26 billion recorded on december 31 2009 represented the difference between the sum of the accrued other postretirement benefits opeb liability of 106 billion and the existing internal veba assets of 126 billion and 258 billion representing the fair value of the consideration transferred at december 31 2009 including the contribution of the existing internal veba assets upon the settlement of the uaw hourly retiree medical plan at december 31 2009 the veba notes series a preferred stock common stock and warrants contributed to the new veba were recorded at fair value and classified as outstanding debt and equity instruments 

prior to december 31 2009 the 260 million shares of series a preferred stock issued to the new veba were not considered outstanding for accounting purposes due to the terms of the revised settlement agreement with the uaw as a result 105 million of the 146 million of dividends paid on september 15 2009 and 147 million of the 203 million of dividends paid on december 15 2009 were recorded as employer contributions resulting in a reduction of postretirement benefits other than pensions

eliminating cost of living adjustments to pensions for retired hourly workers the 2009 caw agreement was conditioned on old gm receiving longer term financial support from the canadian and ontario governments and those governments agreed to the terms of a loan agreement approved the gmcl viability plan and provided funding to gmcl the canadian hourly defined benefit pension plan was remeasured in june 2009 

the caw hourly retiree healthcare plan and the caw retiree life plan were also remeasured in june 2009 additionally as a result of the termination of employees from the former oshawa ontario truck facility gmcl recorded a curtailment gain associated with the caw hourly retiree healthcare plan 

in june 2009 gmcl and the caw agreed to the terms of an independent health care trust hct to provide retiree healthcare benefits to certain active and retired employees and it will be implemented when certain preconditions are achieved certain of the preconditions have not been achieved and the hct is not yet implemented at december 31 2010 gmcl is obligated to make a payment of cad 10 billion on the hct implementation date which it will fund out of its cad 10 billion escrow funds adjusted for the net difference between the amount of retiree monthly contributions received during the period january 1 2010 through the hct implementation date less the cost of benefits paid for claims incurred by covered employees during this period gmcl will provide a cad 800 million note payable to the hct on the hct implementation date which will accrue interest at an annual rate of 70 with five equal annual installments of cad 256 million due december 31 of 2014 through 2018 concurrent with the implementation of the hct gmcl will be legally released from all obligations associated with the cost of providing retiree healthcare benefits to caw active and retired employees bound by the class action process and we will account for the related termination of caw hourly retiree healthcare benefits as a settlement based upon the difference between the fair value of the notes and cash contributed and the healthcare plan obligation at the settlement date as a result of the conditions precedent to this agreement not having yet been achieved there was no accounting recognition for the healthcare trust at december 31 2010 

venezuelan exchange regulations 

our venezuelan subsidiaries changed their functional currency from bolivar fuerte the bsf the local currency to the us dollar our reporting currency on january 1 2010 because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy pursuant to the official devaluation of the venezuelan currency and establishment of the dual fixed exchange rates essential rate of bsf 260 to 100 and nonessential rate of bsf 430 to 100 in january 2010 we remeasured the bsf denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our venezuelan subsidiaries at the nonessential rate of 430 bsf to 100 the remeasurement resulted in a charge of 25 million recorded in automotive cost of sales in the the year ended december 31 2010 in the year ended december 31 2010 all bsf denominated transactions have been remeasured at the nonessential rate of 430 bsf to 100 

in june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced additional foreign currency exchange control regulations which imposed restrictions on the use of the parallel foreign currency exchange market thereby making it more difficult to convert bsf to us dollars we periodically accessed the parallel exchange market which historically enabled entities to obtain foreign currency for transactions that could not be processed by the commission for the administration of currency exchange cadivi the restrictions on the foreign currency exchange market could affect our venezuelan subsidiaries’ ability to pay nonbsf denominated obligations that do not qualify to be processed by cadivi at the official exchange rates as well as our ability to benefit from those operations 

in december 2010 another official devaluation of the venezuelan currency was announced that eliminated the essential rate effective january 1 2011 the devaluation did not have an effect on the 2010 consolidated financial statements however it will affect results of operations in subsequent years because our venezuelan subsidiaries will no longer realize gains that result from favorable foreign currency exchanges processed by cadivi at the essential rate 

effect of freshstart reporting

 production and vehicle sales volume 

management believes that production volume and vehicle sales data provide meaningful information regarding our automotive operating results production volumes manufactured by our assembly facilities are generally aligned with current period net sales and revenue as we generally recognize revenue upon the release of the vehicle to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer which is shortly after the completion of production vehicle sales data which includes retail and fleet sales does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period however vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles and is the basis for our market share

reconciliation of consolidated automotive and gm financial segment results 

management believes ebit provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments’ operating results because it excludes amounts that management does not consider part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization management believes these measures allow it to readily view operating trends perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions we believe ebit is useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and it is therefore used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

while management believes that ebit provides useful information it is not an operating measure under us gaap and there are limitations associated with its use our calculation of ebit may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of ebit has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other measures such as net income loss or net income loss attributable to common stockholders due to these limitations ebit is used as a supplement to us gaap measures 

management believes income loss before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding gm financial’s operating results gm financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment 

the following table summarizes the reconciliation of our automotive segments ebit and gm financial’s income before income taxes to net income loss attributable to stockholders dollars in millions

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity overview 

we believe that our current level of cash marketable securities and availability under our secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs however we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through available liquidity and cash flow from operations our known material future uses of cash include among other possible demands 1 pension and opeb payments 2 continuing capital expenditures 3 spending to implement longterm cost savings and restructuring plans such as restructuring our opelvauxhall operations and potential capacity reduction programs 4 reducing our overall debt levels 5 increase in accounts receivable due to the termination of a wholesale advance agreement with ally financial and 6 certain south american income and indirect taxrelated administrative and legal proceedings may require that we deposit funds in escrow or make payments which may range from 08 billion to 10 billion 

our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those described in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” some of which are outside our control macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans 

recent initiatives 

we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize our liquidity position including actively evaluating the possible sale of noncore cost or equity method investments or other positions which could be significantly positive to our cash flow andor earnings in the nearterm 

in the year ended december 31 2010 we made net investments of 54 billion in highly liquid marketable securities instruments with maturities exceeding 90 days previously these funds would have been invested in shortterm instruments less than 90 days and classified as a component of cash and cash equivalents investments in these longerterm securities will increase the interest we earn on these investments we continue to monitor our investment mix and may reallocate investments based on business requirements 

in june 2010 the german federal government notified us of its decision not to provide loan guarantees to opelvauxhall as a result we have decided to fund the requirements of opelvauxhall internally opelvauxhall subsequently withdrew all applications for government loan guarantees from european governments through september 2010 we committed up to a total of euro 33 billion equivalent to 42 billion when committed to fund opelvauxhall’s restructuring and ongoing cash requirements this funding includes cumulative lending commitments combined into a euro 26 billion intercompany facility and equity commitments of euro 700 million 

in october 2010 we completed our acquisition of americredit for cash of approximately 35 billion and changed the name from americredit to gm financial we funded the transaction using cash on hand 

the repayment of debt remains a key strategic initiative we continue to evaluate potential debt repayments prior to maturity any such repayments may negatively affect our liquidity in the shortterm in 2010 gm daewoo repaid in full and retired its 12 billion revolving credit facility in october 2010 we repaid in full the outstanding amount together with accreted interest thereon of the veba notes of 28 billion in july 2010 our russian subsidiary repaid a loan facility of 150 million to cure a technical default in march and april 2010 we repaid the remaining amounts owed under the ust loans of 57 billion and canadian loan of 13 billion 

as described more fully below in the section entitled “secured revolving credit facility” in october 2010 we entered into a 50 billion secured revolving credit facility while we do not believe the amounts available under the secured revolving credit facility are needed to fund operating activities the facility is expected to provide additional liquidity and financing flexibility 

in november and december 2010 we issued 100 million shares of our series b preferred stock we received net proceeds from the series b preferred stock offering of 49 billion refer to the section below entitled “series b preferred stock issuance” for additional detail

in december 2010 we purchased 84 million shares of our series a preferred stock which accrued cumulative dividends at a 90 annual rate from the ust for a purchase price of 21 billion which was equal to 102 of their aggregate liquidation amount pursuant to an agreement that we entered into with the ust in october 2010 we purchased the series a preferred stock from the ust on the first dividend payment date for the series a preferred stock after the completion of our common stock offering december 15 2010 

we made a voluntary contribution to our us hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of 40 billion of cash in december 2010 and 61 million shares of our common stock valued at 22 billion for funding purposes in january 2011 

under wholesale financing arrangements our us dealers typically borrow money from financial institutions to fund their vehicle purchases from us effective january 2011 we terminated a wholesale advance agreement which provided for accelerated receipt of payments made by ally financial on behalf of our us dealers pursuant to ally financial’s wholesale financing arrangements with dealers similar modifications were made in canada the wholesale advance agreements cover the period for which vehicles are in transit between assembly plants and dealerships we will no longer receive payments in advance of the date vehicles purchased by dealers are scheduled to be delivered resulting in an average increase of approximately 20 billion to our accounts receivable balance depending on sales volumes and certain other factors and the related costs under the arrangements were eliminated 

in january 2011 we withdrew our application for loans available under section 136 of the eisa this decision is consistent with our stated goal to minimize our outstanding debt

guarantees provided to third parties 

we have provided guarantees related to the residual value of operating leases certain suppliers’ commitments certain productrelated claims and commercial loans made by ally financial and outstanding with certain third parties excluding vehicle repurchase obligations residual support and risk sharing related to ally financial the maximum potential obligation under these commitments was 581 million at december 31 2010 the maximum potential obligation under these commitments was 10 billion at december 31 2009 

in may 2009 old gm and ally financial agreed to expand repurchase obligations for ally financial financed inventory at certain dealers in europe asia brazil and mexico in november 2008 old gm and ally financial agreed to expand repurchase obligations for ally financial financed inventory at certain dealers in the united states and canada our current agreement with ally financial requires the repurchase of ally financial financed inventory invoiced to dealers after september 1 2008 with limited exclusions in the event of a qualifying voluntary or involuntary termination of the dealer’s sales and service agreement repurchase obligations exclude vehicles which are damaged have excessive mileage or have been altered the repurchase obligation ended in august 2010 for vehicles invoiced through august 2009 ends in august 2011 for vehicles invoiced through august 2010 and ends in august 2012 for vehicles invoiced through august 2011 

the maximum potential amount of future payments required to be made to ally financial under this guarantee would be based on the repurchase value of total eligible vehicles financed by ally financial in dealer stock and is estimated to be 188 billion at december 31 2010 this amount was estimated to be 142 billion at december 31 2009 if vehicles are required to be repurchased under this arrangement the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer or at auction the fair value of the guarantee was 21 million and 46 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 which considers the likelihood of dealers terminating and estimated the loss exposure for the ultimate disposition of vehicles

required pension funding obligations 

we do not have any required contributions due to our us qualified plans in 2011 the next pension funding valuation to be prepared based on the requirements of the ppa of 2006 will be as of october 1 2010 based on the ppa we have the option to select a funding interest rate for the valuation based on either the full yield curve method or the 3segment method both of which are considered to be acceptable methods the ppa also provides the flexibility of selecting a 3segment rate up to the preceding five months from the valuation date of october 1 2010 ie the 3segment rate at may 31 2010 therefore for a hypothetical funding valuation at december 31 2010 we have assumed the 3segment rate at may 31 2010 as the base for funding interest rate that we could use for the actual funding valuation since this hypothetical election does not limit us to only using the 3segment rate beyond 2010 we have assumed that we retain the flexibility of selecting a funding interest rate based on either the full yield curve method or the 3segment method a hypothetical funding valuation at december 31 2010 using the 3segment rate at may 31 2010 for plan year beginning october 1 2010 funding valuation and assuming the december 31 2010 full yield curve funding interest rate for all future funding valuations projects contributions of 23 billion and 12 billion in 2015 and 2016

in january 2011 we completed the previously announced voluntary contribution of 61 million shares of our common stock to our us hourly and salaried pension plans valued at 22 billion for funding purposes this was a voluntary contribution and the amount is reflected in the plan assets used to project the future required contributions above since the contributed shares qualify as a plan asset for funding purposes immediately the contributed shares will qualify as a plan asset for accounting purposes when certain transfer restrictions are removed which is expected in 2011 

the hypothetical valuations do not consider the potential election of relief provisions that are available to us under the pension relief act of 2010 pra for 2010 and 2011 plan year valuations

 refer to notes 21 and 24 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements 

level 3 assets and liabilities 

at december 31 2010 we used level 3 inputs to measure net liabilities of 14 million or less than 01 of our total liabilities these net liabilities included 10 million or less than 01 of the total assets and 24 million or 164 of the total liabilities that we measured at fair value 

in the year ended december 31 2010 assets and liabilities measured using level 3 inputs decreased 658 million from a net liability of 672 million to a net liability of 14 million this reduction was primarily due to unrealized and realized gains on derivatives the settlement of derivative positions according to their terms and maturities and the reclassification of outstanding derivative contracts from level 3 to level 2 during the three months ended december 31 2010 

at december 31 2010 our nonperformance risk remains unobservable through a liquid credit default swap market during the three months ended december 31 2010 we determined that our nonperformance risk no longer represents significant input in the determination of the fair value of our derivatives the effect of our nonperformance risk in the valuation has been reduced due to the reduction in the remaining duration and magnitude of these net derivative liability positions in october 2010 we transferred foreign currency derivatives with a fair market value of 183 million from level 3 to level 2 

at december 31 2009 we used level 3 inputs to measure net liabilities of 672 million or 06 of our total liabilities these net liabilities included 33 million or 01 of the total assets and 705 million or 987 of the total liabilities all of which were derivative liabilities that we measured at fair value at december 31 2009 we also included a nonperformance risk adjustment of 47 million in the fair value measurement of these derivatives which reflects a discount of 65 to the fair value before considering our credit risk

freshstart reporting 

the bankruptcy court did not determine a reorganization value in connection with the 363 sale reorganization value is defined as the value of our assets without liabilities in order to apply freshstart reporting asc 852 requires that total postpetition liabilities and allowed claims be in excess of reorganization value and prepetition stockholders receive less than 500 of our common stock based on our estimated reorganization value we determined that on july 10 2009 both the criteria of asc 852 were met and as a result we applied freshstart reporting

 in order to estimate these effects we adjusted the wacc and longterm growth rate assumptions for each of old gm’s former segments and for certain subsidiaries the aggregated effect of these assumption changes on each of old gm’s former segments and for certain subsidiaries does not necessarily correspond to assumption changes made at a consolidated level 

pensions 

the defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate due to significant events including those discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements certain of the pension plans were remeasured at various dates in the year ended december 31 2010 the periods july 10 2009 through december 31 2009 january 1 2009 through july 9 2009 and in the year ended december 31 2008 

net pension expense is calculated based on the expected return on plan assets and not the actual return on plan assets the expected return on us plan assets that is included in pension expense is determined from periodic studies which include a review of asset allocation strategies anticipated future longterm performance of individual asset classes risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans’ asset mix while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns the assumptions are primarily longterm prospective rates of return in december 2010 an analysis of the investment policy was completed for the us pension plans which reduced the expected return on assets to 80 from 85 at december 31 2009 the decrease in expected return on assets is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities and equitylike asset classes differences between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as an actuarial gain or loss and subject to possible amortization into net pension expense over future periods a marketrelated value of plan assets which averages gains and losses over a period of years is utilized in the determination of future pension expense for substantially all pension plans marketrelated value is defined as an amount that initially recognizes 600 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated value and 100 of that difference over each of the next four years the marketrelated value of assets at december 31 2010 used to determine us and nonus net periodic pension income for the year ending december 31 2011 was 41 billion and 03 billion lower than the actual fair value of plan assets at december 31 2010 

another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations we estimate this rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along

a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate old gm used an iterative process to determine the discount rate based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of highquality bonds rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and a hypothetical reinvestment of the proceeds of such bonds upon maturity using forward rates derived from a yield curve until the us pension obligation was defeased this reinvestment component was incorporated into the methodology because it was not feasible in light of the magnitude and time horizon over which us pension obligations extend to accomplish full defeasance through direct cash flows from an actual set of bonds selected at any given measurement date 

the benefit obligation for pension plans in canada the united kingdom and germany comprise 92 of the nonus pension benefit obligation at december 31 2010 the discount rates for canadian plans are determined using a cash flow matching approach similar to the us approach the discount rates for plans in the united kingdom and germany use a curve derived from high quality corporate bonds with maturities consistent with the plans’ underlying duration of expected benefit payments

the following data illustrates the sensitivity of changes in pension expense and pension obligation based on the last remeasurement of the us hourly pension plan at december 31 2010 as a result of changes in future benefit units for us hourly employees effective after the expiration of the current contract dollars in millions 

 

 we utilize a variety of pricing sources to estimate the fair value of our pension assets including independent pricing vendors dealer or counterparty supplied valuations third party appraisals appraisals prepared by investment managers or investment sponsor or third party administrator supplied net asset value or its equivalent per share nav used as a practical expedient 

a significant portion of our pension assets are classified in level 3 pension assets for which fair value is determined through the use of nav and for which we may not have the ability to redeem our entire investment with the investee at nav as of the measurement date or in the nearterm are classified in level 3 we classify pension assets that include significant unobservable inputs in level 3

other postretirement benefits 

opeb plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumptions including a discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates old gm estimated the discount rate using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of highquality bonds rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and a hypothetical reinvestment of the proceeds of such bonds upon maturity using forward rates derived from a yield curve until the us opeb obligation was defeased this reinvestment component was incorporated into the methodology because it was not feasible in light of the magnitude and time horizon over which the us opeb obligations extend to accomplish full defeasance through direct cash flows from an actual set of bonds selected at any given measurement date 

beginning in september 2008 the discount rate used for the benefits to be paid from the uaw retiree medical plan during the period september 2008 through december 2009 was based on a yield curve which used projected cash flows of representative highquality aa rated bonds matched to spot rates along a yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate all other us opeb plans started using a discount rate based on a yield curve on july 10 2009 the uaw retiree medical plan was settled on december 31 2009 and the plan assets were contributed to the new veba as part of the payment terms under the 2009 uaw retiree settlement agreement we are released from uaw retiree healthcare claims incurred after december 31 2009

 as a result of modifications made as part of the 363 sale there are no significant uncapped us healthcare plans remaining at december 31 2010 and therefore the healthcare cost trend rate no longer has a significant effect in the us an estimate is developed of the healthcare cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations for nonus plans through review of historical retiree cost data and nearterm healthcare outlook which includes appropriate cost control measures that have been implemented changes in the healthcare cost trend rate can have significant effect on the actuarially determined obligation and related opeb expense

deferred taxes  valuation allowances 

we establish and old gm established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction we consider and old gm considered the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

 

  

  

  

 the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 concluding a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable such as cumulative losses in recent years we utilize and old gm utilized a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years as adjusted for nonrecurring matters 

the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

though objective and verifiable negative evidence continues to outweigh positive evidence in our key valuation allowance jurisdictions we are experiencing positive evidence trends in various jurisdictions south korea and australia are farther ahead in this trend of sustained operating profits and taxable income us and canada operations are showing early signs of this positive evidence trend and germany spain and the united kingdom operations are not yet experiencing such a favorable shift to the extent this trend continues it is reasonably possible our conclusion regarding the need for full valuation allowances could change resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowances

valuation of vehicle operating leases and lease residuals 

in accounting for vehicle operating leases a determination is made at the inception of a lease of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from nine months to five years a customer is obligated to make payments during the term of a lease to the contract residual a customer is not obligated to purchase a vehicle at the end of a lease and we are and old gm was exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of a vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception 

residual values are initially determined by consulting independently published residual value guides realization of residual values is dependent on the future ability to market vehicles under prevailing market conditions over the life of a lease the adequacy of the 

  

confidential 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

estimated residual value is evaluated and adjustments are made to the extent the expected value of a vehicle at lease termination declines adjustments may be in the form of revisions to depreciation rates or recognition of impairment charges impairment is determined to exist if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the carrying amount of the leased vehicle additionally for automotive retail leases an adjustment may also be made to the estimate of sales incentive accruals for residual support and risk sharing programs initially recorded when the vehicles are sold 

with respect to residual values of automotive leases to daily rental car companies due to the shortterm nature of the operating leases old gm historically had forecasted auction proceeds at lease termination in the three months ended december 31 2008 forecasted auction proceeds in the united states differed significantly from actual auction proceeds due to highly volatile economic conditions in particular a decline in consumer confidence and available consumer credit which affected the residual values of vehicles at auction due to these significant uncertainties old gm determined that it no longer had a reliable basis to forecast auction proceeds in the united states and began utilizing current auction proceeds to estimate the residual values in the impairment analysis for the automotive leases to daily rental car companies which is consistent with old gm’s impairment analyses for automotive retail leases as a result of this change in estimate old gm recorded an incremental impairment charge of 144 million in the three months ended december 31 2008 related to the automotive leases to daily rental car companies 

the following table summarizes recorded impairment charges related to automotive retail leases to daily rental car companies and automotive retail leases dollars in millions 

 

  

 we continue to use the lower of forecasted or current auction proceeds to estimate residual values for impairment purposes significant differences between the estimate of residual values and actual experience may materially affect impairment charges recorded if any and the rate at which vehicles in equipment on operating leases net are depreciated significant differences will also affect the residual support and risk sharing reserves established as a result of certain agreements with ally financial whereby ally financial is reimbursed up to an agreedupon percentage of certain residual value losses they experience on their operating lease portfolio during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded favorable adjustments to our residual support and risk sharing liabilities of 06 billion in the us due to increases in estimated residual values 

the following table illustrates the effect of changes in our estimate of vehicle sales proceeds at lease termination on residual support and risk sharing reserves related to vehicles owned by ally financial at december 31 2010 and 2009 holding all other assumptions constant dollars in millions 

 

 the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying amount of leased vehicles included within equipment on operating leases net include 1 estimated market value information obtained and used in estimating residual values 2 proper identification and estimation of business conditions 3 remarketing abilities and 4 vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the estimate of residual values

due to the contractual terms of our residual support and risk sharing agreements with ally financial which currently limit our maximum obligation to ally financial should vehicle residual values decrease an increase in sales proceeds does not have the equivalent offsetting effect on our residual support and risk sharing reserves as a decrease in sales proceeds 

the following table summarizes the maximum obligation and recorded receivables and liabilities associated with the contractual terms of our residual support and risk sharing agreements with ally financial dollars in millions 

 

 when a lease vehicle is returned or repossessed by us the asset is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated selling price less cost to sell 

impairment of goodwill 

goodwill arises from the application of freshstart reporting and acquisitions accounted for as business combinations goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all reporting units or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value our reporting units are gmna gme gm financial and various reporting units within the gmio and gmsa segments due to the integrated nature of our manufacturing operations and the sharing of vehicle platforms among brands assets and other resources are shared extensively within gmna and gme and financial information by brand or country is not discrete below the operating segment level such that gmna and gme do not contain reporting units below the operating segment level gm financial also does not contain reporting units below the operating segment level gmio and gmsa are less integrated given the lack of regional trade pacts and other unique geographical differences and thus contain separate reporting units below the operating segment level 

at december 31 2010 we had goodwill of 318 billion which predominately arose upon the application of freshstart reporting and the acquisition of americredit when applying freshstart reporting certain accounts primarily employee benefit and income tax related were recorded at amounts determined under specific us gaap rather than fair value and the difference between the us gaap and fair value amounts gives rise to goodwill which is a residual our employee benefit related accounts were recorded in accordance with asc 712 and asc 715 and deferred income taxes were recorded in accordance with asc 740 further we recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets which under asc 852 also resulted in goodwill if all identifiable assets and liabilities had been recorded at fair value upon application of freshstart reporting no goodwill would have resulted in conjunction with the acquisition of gm financial in october 2010 we recorded 13 billion of acquisition related goodwill including 153 million recorded at the acquisitiondate to establish a valuation allowance for deferred taxes which was not applicable to gm financial on a standalone basis 

in the future we have an increased likelihood of measuring goodwill for possible impairment during our annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment testing and in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists for reporting units with zero or negative carrying values an eventdriven impairment test is required if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value because our reporting units were recorded at their fair values upon application of freshstart reporting it is more likely a decrease in the fair value of our reporting units from their freshstart reporting values could occur and such a decrease would trigger the need to measure for possible goodwill impairments refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the adoption of asu 201028 “intangibles goodwill and other when to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units”

future goodwill impairments could occur should the fair valuetous gaap adjustments differences decrease goodwill predominately resulted from our recorded liabilities for certain employee benefit obligations being higher than the fair value of these obligations because lower discount rates were utilized in determining the us gaap values compared to those utilized to determine fair values the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of these obligations were based on our incremental borrowing rates which included our nonperformance risk our incremental borrowing rates are also affected by changes in market interest rates further the recorded amounts of our assets were lower than their fair values because of the recording of valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets the difference between these fair valuetous gaap amounts would decrease upon an improvement in our credit rating thus resulting in a decrease in the spread between our employee benefit related obligations under us gaap and their fair values a decrease will also occur upon reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances should the fair valuetous gaap adjustments differences decrease for these reasons the implied goodwill balance will decline accordingly at the next annual or eventdriven goodwill impairment test to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment could occur future goodwill impairments could also occur should we reorganize our internal reporting structure in a manner that changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units upon such an event goodwill would be reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relativefairvalue allocation approach unless the entity was never integrated and not based on the amount of goodwill that was originally attributable to fair valuetous gaap differences that gave rise to goodwill 

when performing our goodwill impairment testing the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on valuation techniques using the best available information primarily discounted cash flow projections we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty where available and as appropriate comparative market multiples and the quoted market price of our common stock are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method while we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect on the consolidated financial statements assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units include 

 

  

  

 during the three months ended december 31 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units based on this testing we determined that goodwill was not impaired the valuation methodologies utilized to perform our goodwill impairment testing were consistent with those used in our application of freshstart reporting on july 10 2009 as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and in any subsequent annual or eventdriven impairment tests and resulted in level 3 measures the following table summarizes the key assumptions for each of our more significant reporting units utilized in our 2010 annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 2010 dollars and volumes in millions

the waccs considered various factors including bond yields risk premiums and tax rates the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied a reporting unit’s longterm growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond 2014 and industry sales and a market share for each reporting unit included annual estimates through 2014 except for gme which is through 2015 

our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value the estimates and assumptions used are subject to significant uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and there is no assurance that anticipated financial results will be achieved 

in calculating the fair values of our more significant reporting units during our 2010 annual goodwill impairment testing keeping all other assumptions constant the carrying values of these reporting units would still exceed their estimated fair values had our wacc increased by 165 percentage points for gmna 7 percentage points for gme 11 percentage points for gm daewoo 135 percentage points for holden and 87 percentage points for gm mercosur 

in the three months ended june 30 2010 there were eventdriven changes in circumstances within our gme reporting unit that warranted the testing of goodwill for impairment in the three months ended june 30 2010 anticipated competitive pressure on our margins in the near and mediumterm led us to believe that the goodwill associated with our gme reporting unit may be impaired utilizing the best available information at june 30 2010 the date of impairment measurement we performed a step 1 goodwill impairment test for our gme reporting unit and concluded that goodwill was not impaired the fair value of our gme reporting unit was estimated to be approximately 325 million over its carrying amount if we had not passed step 1 we believe the amount of any goodwill impairment would approximate 140 million representing the net decrease from july 9 2009 through june 30 2010 in the fair valuetous gaap differences attributable to those assets and liabilities that gave rise to goodwill 

refer to notes 13 and 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairments 

impairment of longlived assets 

the carrying amount of longlived assets and finitelived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated when events and circumstances warrant if the carrying amount of a longlived asset group is considered impaired a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for the asset group to be held and used productspecific longlived assets are tested for impairment at the platform level nonproduct line specific longlived assets are tested for impairment on a segment basis in gmna gme and gm financial and tested at or within our various reporting units within gmio and gmsa segments assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved we develop anticipated cash flows from historical experience and internal business plans a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the longlived asset impairment tests principally in determining the fair value of the asset groups and the assets’ average estimated useful life while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets could become impaired in the future as a result of declines in profitability due to significant changes in volume pricing or costs refer to note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairments of longlived assets and intangibles 

valuation of cost and equity method investments 

when events and circumstances warrant equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment an impairment charge would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary in determining if a decline is other than temporary we consider and old gm considered such factors as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity affiliate the nearterm and longerterm operating and financial prospects of the affiliate and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery

when available quoted market prices are used to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon valuation techniques that use where possible marketbased inputs generally fair value is estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach because circumstances usually do not permit the use of a single approach under the income approach estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved using marketplace assumptions under the market approach valuations are based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings and book value multiples for the same or comparable entities the assumptions used in the income and market approaches have a significant effect on the determination of fair value significant assumptions include estimated future cash flows appropriate discount rates and adjustments to market transactions and market multiples for differences between the market data and the investment being valued changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the valuation of cost and equity method investments 

in the three months ended december 31 2009 we recorded impairment charges related to our investment in ally financial common stock of 270 million we determined the fair value of our investment in ally financial common stock using a market multiple sumoftheparts methodology this methodology considered the average pricetangible book value multiples of companies deemed comparable to each of ally financial’s operations which were then aggregated to determine ally financial’s overall fair value based on our analysis the estimated fair value of our investment in ally financial common stock was determined to be 970 million resulting in an impairment charge of 270 million the following table illustrates the effect of a 01 change in the average pricetangible book value multiple on our impairment charge dollars in millions 

 

 at december 31 2010 the balance of our investment in ally financial common stock was 964 million and the balance of our investment in ally financial preferred stock was 665 million 

derivatives 

derivatives are used in the normal course of business to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in certain commodity prices and interest and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives are accounted for in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value 

significant judgments and estimates are used in estimating the fair values of derivative instruments particularly in the absence of quoted market prices internal models are used to value a majority of derivatives the models use as their basis readily observable market inputs such as time value forward interest rates volatility factors and current and forward market prices for commodities and foreign currency exchange rates 

the valuation of derivative liabilities takes into account our nonperformance risk at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 our nonperformance risk was not observable through a liquid credit default swap market our nonperformance risk was estimated using internal analysis to develop conclusions on our implied credit rating which we used to determine the appropriate credit spread which would be applied to us by market participants prior to receiving published credit ratings we developed our credit rating conclusions using an analysis of comparable industrial companies at december 31 2010 we incorporated published credit agency ratings of gm into our credit rating conclusions at december 31 2009 all derivatives whose fair values contained a significant credit adjustment based on our nonperformance risk were classified in level 3 at december 31 2010 we have determined that our nonperformance risk no longer represents a significant input in the determination of the fair value of our derivatives as of december 31 2010 all automotive operations derivatives have been classified in level 2 

sales incentives 

the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive revenue and in certain instances as an increase to automotive cost of sales at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time including a choice of incentives for a specific

model incentive programs are generally brand specific model specific or region specific and are for specified time periods which may be extended significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid the reduction in automotive revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives 

policy warranty and recalls 

the estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and the estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated these estimates are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line however where little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line the estimate is based on longterm historical averages revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

automotive 

we and old gm entered into a variety of foreign currency exchange interest rate and commodity forward contracts and options to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and certain commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 

the overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the risk management committee which reviews and where appropriate approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks the risk management committee is comprised of members of our management and functions under the oversight of the finance and risk committee a committee of the board of directors the finance and risk committee assists and guides the board in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies a risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the risk management committee 

in august 2010 we changed our risk management policy our prior policy was intended to reduce volatility of forecasted cash flows primarily through the use of forward contracts and swaps the intent of the new policy is primarily to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures and involves a shift to greater use of purchased options 

a discussion of our and old gm’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements further information on our exposure to market risk is included in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

old gm’s credit standing and liquidity position in the first half of 2009 and the chapter 11 proceedings severely limited its ability to manage risks using derivative financial instruments as most derivative counterparties were unwilling to enter into transactions with old gm subsequent to the 363 sale and through december 31 2009 we were largely unable to enter forward contracts pending the completion of negotiations with potential derivative counterparties since august 2010 we executed new agreements with counterparties that enable us to enter into options forward contracts and swaps 

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk commodity price risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk the models used assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity prices for options and other instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rates and commodity prices change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting longshort positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have and old gm had foreign currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2010 such contracts have remaining maturities of up to 12 months at december 31 2010 our three most significant foreign currency exposures are the eurobritish pound us dollarkorean won and eurokorean won 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was 33 billion and 59 billion this presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalents and other assets the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 513 million and 941 million at december 31 2010 and 2009

we are and old gm was exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation of the results of certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial position 

the following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction gains losses dollars in millions 

 

 interest rate risk 

we are and old gm was subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments primarily debt capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities 

interest rate risk in old gm was managed primarily with interest rate swaps the interest rate swaps old gm entered into usually involved the exchange of fixed for variable rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into variable rate debt in order to achieve a target range of variable rate debt at december 31 2010 we did not have any interest rate swap derivative positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations 

the following table summarizes our automotive debt by fixed rate and variable rate dollars in millions 

 

   

confidential 

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

at december 31 2010 and 2009 the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was 48 billion and 160 billion the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 decrease in quoted interest rates would be 166 million and 402 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 

at december 31 2010 we had 66 billion in marketable securities with exposure to interest rate risk we invest in securities of various types and maturities the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates the potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be 15 million at december 31 2010 our exposure to interest rate risk on marketable securities at december 31 2009 was insignificant 

commodity price risk 

we are and old gm was exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the automotive business primarily associated with various nonferrous and precious metals for automotive components and energy used in the overall manufacturing process certain commodity purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative old gm entered into various derivatives such as commodity swaps and options to offset its commodity price exposures we use commodity options to offset our commodity price exposures 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net fair value asset of commodity derivatives was 84 million and 11 million the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would be 47 million and 6 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 this amount excludes the offsetting effect of the commodity price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

equity price risk 

we are and old gm was exposed to changes in prices of equity securities held we typically do not attempt to reduce our market exposure to these equity instruments our exposure includes certain investments we hold in warrants of other companies at december 31 2010 and 2009 the fair value of these warrants was 44 million and 25 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 our exposure also includes investments of 43 million and 45 million in equity securities recorded at fair value these amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss from these investments 

at december 31 2010 the carrying amount of cost method investments was 17 billion of which the carrying amounts of our investments in ally financial common stock and ally financial preferred stock were 964 million and 665 million at december 31 2009 the carrying amount of cost method investments was 17 billion of which the carrying amounts of our investments in ally financial common stock and preferred stock were 970 million and 665 million these amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss from these investments 

counterparty risk 

we are exposed to counterparty risk on derivative contracts which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted we enter into agreements with counterparties that allow the setoff of certain exposures in order to manage this risk 

our counterparty risk is managed by our risk management committee which establishes exposure limits by counterparty we monitor and report our exposures to the risk management committee on a periodic basis at december 31 2010 a majority of all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that are rated a or higher 

concentration of credit risk 

we are exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through holding cash and cash equivalents which include money market funds short and longterm investments and derivatives as part of our risk management process we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed

general motors company and subsidiaries 

  

we are exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in money market funds we invested in if the funds were to deny redemption requests as part of our risk management process we invest in large funds that are managed by reputable financial institutions we also follow investment guidelines to limit our exposure to individual funds and financial institutions 

automotive financing 

fluctuations in market interest rates affect gm financial’s credit facilities and securitization transactions gm financial’s gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of gm financial’s dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund purchases of finance receivables 

credit facilities 

fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities the purchaser of the interest rate cap pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate the purchaser of the interest rate cap bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate as part of gm financial’s interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible it may simultaneously enter into a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap and thus retain the interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate cap purchased is included in total gm financial assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold is included in total gm financial liabilities 

securitizations 

the interest rate demanded by investors in gm financial’s securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment gm financial utilizes several strategies to minimize the effect of interest rate fluctuations on its gross interest rate margin including the use of derivative financial instruments and the regular sale or pledging of automotive receivables to securitization trusts 

in gm financial’s securitization transactions it transfers fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various libor rates and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap and cap derivatives are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions gm financial uses interest rate swap derivatives to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by its securitization trusts to a fixed rate thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by it over the life of a securitization interest rate swap derivatives purchased by gm financial do not affect the amount of cash flows received by holders of the assetbacked securities issued by the trusts the interest rate swap derivative serve to offset the effect of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate assetbacked securities on the cash flows received from the trusts gm financial utilizes such arrangements to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on risk tolerance in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception gm financial may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates its special purpose entities are contractually required to purchase a derivative financial instrument to protect the net spread in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities even if gm financial chooses not to hedge its future cash flows although the interest rate cap derivatives are purchased by the trusts cash outflows from the trusts ultimately affect gm financial’s retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by gm financial therefore when economically feasible gm financial may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap derivative to offset the premium paid

by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap derivative the fair value of the interest rate cap derivatives purchased in connection with securitization transactions are included in total gm financial assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap derivatives sold are included in total gm financial liabilities changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap derivatives are a component of interest expense recorded in gm financial operating expenses and other 

gm financial has entered into interest rate swap derivatives to hedge the variability in interest payments on eight of its active securitization transactions portions of these interest rate swap derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the fair value of interest rate swap derivatives designated as hedges is included in gm financial other liabilities interest rate swap derivatives that are not designated as hedges are included in gm financial other assets

gm financial estimates the realization of financing receivables in future periods using discount rate prepayment and credit loss assumptions similar to its historical experience notional amounts on interest rate swap and cap derivatives are based on contractual terms credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classified based on expected payoff senior notes and convertible senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on maturity 

the notional amounts of interest rate swap and cap derivatives which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and thus are not a measure of gm financial’s exposure to loss through its use of these derivatives 

gm financial monitors hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk however there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on gm financial’s profitability gm financial does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes

our management with the participation of our chairman and ceo and our vice chairman and cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e promulgated under the exchange act at december 31 2010 based on these evaluations our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph b of rules 13a15 or 15d15 were effective as of december 31 2010 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting this system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2010 utilizing the criteria discussed in the “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2010 

based on management’s assessment we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2010 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included herein 

remediation and changes in internal controls 

in our 2009 annual report on form 10k we identified a material weakness because we did not maintain effective controls over the periodend financial reporting process a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

in 2009 significant activities were performed in remediating the material weakness however we were not able to sufficiently test the operating effectiveness of certain remediated internal controls given the limited time that controls were in operation during 2010 management led various initiatives to further enhance our controls over periodend financial reporting including training and

enhanced procedures related to the preparation of the statement of cash flows to help ensure controls over the periodend financial reporting process would operate as they had been designed and deployed during the 2009 material weakness remediation efforts based upon the actions taken and our testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls we have concluded the material weakness related to controls over the periodend financial reporting process no longer existed as of december 31 2010 

other than as previously discussed there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the three months ended december 31 2010 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system cannot provide absolute assurance due to its inherent limitations it is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures a control system also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of such limitations disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all misstatements whether unintentional errors or fraud however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk
