adm’s global operations function with trained individuals necessary for the processing warehousing and shipping of raw materials for products used in other areas of manufacturing or sold as inputs or products to thirdparty customers the availability of skilled trade and production workers has been a specific focus for the united states manufacturing industry the pandemic has put further strain on manufacturing labor amid fears of the pandemic childcare challenges along with the reallocation friction resulting in some of the workforce shifts from manufacturing positions the company has various methods and tactics to mitigate potential shortfalls the inability to properly staff manufacturing facilities with skilled trades and hourly labor due to a limited number of qualified resources could negatively impact operations 

the company’s information technology it systems processes and sites may suffer cyber security breaches interruptions or failures which may affect the company’s ability to conduct its business 

  

the company’s operations rely on certain key it systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties to provide critical data connectivity information and services for internal and external users these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers risk management activities converting raw materials to finished products inventory management shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting financial results of operations human resources benefits and payroll management and complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements the company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and integrating it with various third party service providers on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment this will help the company in mitigating the risk of instability in aging legacy systems and manual processes increased it security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s third party data the company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve and any violation could subject the company to legal claims regulatory penalties and damage to its reputation the company has put in place security measures to prevent detect and mitigate cyberbased attacks and has instituted control procedures for cybersecurity incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems in addition the company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches and reports metrics on the quality of the company’s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the board of directors however if the company’s it systems are breached damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches or cyberbased attacks and the company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis the company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations loss of valuable data actual or threatened legal actions and damage to its reputation which may adversely impact the company’s revenues operating results and financial condition 

the company may be impacted by carbon emission regulations in multiple regions throughout the globe 

a number of jurisdictions where the company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce ghg emissions including but not limited to the united states canada mexico the european union and its member states and china in particular the state of illinois recently enacted legislation intended to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 the company’s operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the company it is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation regulations or agreements potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy transportation raw material and administrative costs and may require the company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment the company has programs and policies in place to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations 



the company faces risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks 

while adm has effectively managed through the risks arising from the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus covid19 and has implemented mitigation actions across global operations that has had a positive impact on its customers employees local communities and other stakeholders the company could be materially impacted in the future if a more severe variant would arise causing disruptions far more severe than the company has recently experienced in such circumstances adm may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected and costs and working capital needs may increase these cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance in addition demand for certain products that adm produces particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels could be materially impacted from a prolonged covid19 variant outbreak or significant local resurgences of the virus leading to additional governmentimposed lockdowns quarantines or other restrictions 

the company is exposed to potential business disruption including but not limited to disruption of transportation services disruption in the supply of noncommodity raw materials used in its processing operations and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war natural disasters pandemics severe weather conditions accidents or other planned disruptions which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the company’s facilities and impair the company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner the company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively in addition if certain nonagricultural commodity raw materials such as water or certain chemicals used in the company’s processing operations are not available the company’s business could be disrupted any major lack of available water for use in certain of the company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results certain factors which may impact the availability of nonagricultural commodity raw materials are out of the company’s control including but not limited to disruptions resulting from weather high or low river water conditions economic conditions manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers shortage of materials interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions 

the assets and operations of the company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include but are not limited to acts of terrorism for example purposeful adulteration of the company’s products war natural disasters pandemics severe weather conditions accidents explosions fires or other outages the company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the company’s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks in addition the company conforms to management systems such as international organization for standardization iso or other recognized global standards 

the company’s risk management strategies may not be effective 

  

the company has a chief risk officer who oversees the erm program and regularly reports to the board of directors on the myriad of risks facing the company and the company’s strategies for mitigating those risks the company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices transportation costs energy prices interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets the company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks the company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the board of directors through the erm process the company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring limits approvals and executes training on trade compliance commodity regulatory reporting controls and other policies the company’s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure if these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the company’s exposure to these fluctuations it could adversely affect the company’s operating results 



legal regulations and compliance risks 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in over 190 countries and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the united states federal government as well as state local and nonus governmental authorities in numerous areas including accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing amount of deductions the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and further risks related to changing tax laws domestically and globally any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation 

the production of the company’s products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances including ghg emissions the company has programs and policies in place eg corporate sustainability program commitment to protecting forests biodiversity and communities environmental policy strive 35 environmental goals etc to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the company failure to comply with the laws and regulations can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 

in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations  for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws  may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates regulations and trade agreements including taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards sustainable practices product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates these policies can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states including the treatment of small refinery exemptions can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products adversely affect the company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 



the company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary fiscal trade and environmental policies laws regulations and acquisition approvals creating risks including but not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions local labor conditions and regulations and safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets the company has historically benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the us and other sources to markets around the world increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world eg the uschina trade relations dispute iran sanctions could negatively impact the company’s ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model expanding its valueadded product portfolio and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in government policies including but not limited to antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements and traceability can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully 

credit and liquidity risk  the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities the company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies regarding risk management practices 

libor london interbank offered rate has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated libor will be discontinued or modified by june 2023 the company’s variable rate debt credit facilities certain derivative agreements and commercial agreements may use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates although the company does not expect that a transition from libor will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs the company continues to monitor developments 



business environment and competition risks 

the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by climate change weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations including impacts from factors outside the company’s control such as changes in weather conditions climate change rising sea levels crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition and changes in global demand which could adversely affect the company’s operating results the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities managementestablished limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities 

reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner high and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on shortterm working capital funding conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection farming techniques storage and logistics and speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity online build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and in many cases subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the company has a significant presence and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises to compete effectively the company focuses on safely improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market presence maintaining a high level of product safety and quality supporting socially responsible and sustainable practices promoting environmental responsibility and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions

operating performance indicators 

the company’s ag services and oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials as a result changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues 

the company’s carbohydrate solutions operations and nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil and argentina the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings gross margins segment operating profit return on invested capital earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies trade policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans management makes several estimates and assumptions including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans rates of compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future health care costs these estimates and assumptions are based on the company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances management also uses thirdparty actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would result in a 90 million decrease to the companys pension benefit obligation improving the funded status by the same amount while a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company’s pension expense by 4 million 

the company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses under the corridor approach net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods for plans with little to no active participants the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants for plans with active participants the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants the amortization periods range from 2 to 28 years for the company’s defined benefit pension plans and from 6 to 21 years for the company’s postretirement benefit plans 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 

the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge anticipated transactions 

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 



in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the change in fair value of the average position was due to the increase in average quantities and prices of the underlying commodities 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 

the amount the company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 106 billion and 105 billion 127 billion and 125 billion at historical rates at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of 02 billion partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 01 billion the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 13 billion for december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2021 is primarily due to increased borrowings

the company’s risk management strategies may not be effective 

  

the company has a chief risk officer who oversees the erm program and regularly reports to the board of directors on the myriad of risks facing the company and the company’s strategies for mitigating those risks the company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices transportation costs energy prices interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets the company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks the company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the board of directors through the erm process the company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring limits approvals and executes training on trade compliance commodity regulatory reporting controls and other policies the company’s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure if these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the company’s exposure to these fluctuations it could adversely affect the company’s operating results

legal regulations and compliance risks 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in 200 countries and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the united states federal government as well as state local and nonus governmental authorities in numerous areas including accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation 

the production of the company’s products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions the company has programs and policies in place eg corporate sustainability program nodeforestation policy environmental policy strive 35 environmental goals etc to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the company failure to comply with the laws and regulations can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 

in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations  for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws  may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates regulations and trade agreements including taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards sustainable practices product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates these policies can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states including the treatment of small refinery exemptions can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products adversely affect the company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 



the company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary fiscal trade and environmental policies laws regulations and acquisition approvals creating risks including but not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions eg brexit local labor conditions and regulations and safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets there has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged the company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the us and other sources to markets around the world increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world eg the uschina trade relations dispute iran sanctions could negatively impact the company’s ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio government policies including but not limited to antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements and traceability can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully 

credit and liquidity risk  the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities the company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies regarding risk management practices 

libor london interbank offered rate has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated libor will be discontinued or modified by june 2023 the company’s variable rate debt credit facilities certain derivative agreements and commercial agreements may use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates while it is not possible to predict the consequences of discontinuation or modification of libor at this time the company’s financing costs could be adversely or positively impacted although the company does not expect that a transition from libor will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs the company continues to monitor developments 



business environment and competition risks 

the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by climate change weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations including impacts from factors outside the company’s control such as changes in weather conditions climate change rising sea levels crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition and changes in global demand which could adversely affect the company’s operating results the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities managementestablished limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities 

reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner high and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on shortterm working capital funding conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection farming techniques storage and logistics and speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors 

fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results the company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its energy intensity globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change

the company may fail to realize the benefits of or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy which encompasses organic and inorganic initiatives including those outside the us and in businesses where the company does not currently have a large presence 

as the company executes its growth strategy through both organic and inorganic growth it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs decreased revenues and delayed synergies growth in new geographies outside the us can expose the company to volatile economic political and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy expanding businesses where the company has limited presence may expose the company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms inability to retainhire strategic talent or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays costs and other problems due diligence performed prior to an acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the companys reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits additionally acquisitions may involve integration risks such as internal control effectiveness system integration risks the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles ability to retain acquired employees and other unanticipated risks

operating performance indicators 

the company’s ag services and oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials as a result changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues 

the company’s carbohydrate solutions operations and nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil and argentina the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings gross margins segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies trade policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 



the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of a decrease in quantities 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 



the amount the company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 105 billion and 96 billion 125 billion and 116 billion at historical rates at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of 10 billion the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 13 billion and 12 billion for december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in the fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2020 is primarily due to de creased interest rates and increased borrowings

risk factors 

tableend

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance 

management directs a companywide enterprise risk management erm program with oversight from the company’s board of directors the company’s audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis 

the company through its business unit functional and corporate teams continually updates assesses monitors and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the erm program and as monitored by the erm program team and chief risk officer 



the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the erm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits 

the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by climate change weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations including impacts from factors outside the companys control such as changes in weather climate and rising sea levels crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition and changes in global demand the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities managementestablished limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities 

reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner high and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on shortterm working capital funding conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection farming techniques storage and logistics and speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the company 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity online build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and in many cases subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the company has a significant presence and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market presence maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions 

in the case of the nutrition business while maintaining efficient and costeffective operations are important the ability to drive innovation and come up with quality nutritional solutions for human and animal needs are key factors to remain competitive in the nutrition market 



fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas while 44 percent of the company’s processing plants and 57 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the united states the company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as western europe canada and brazil and emerging market areas one of the company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the company’s products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the company’s suppliers customers and other counterparties in addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges epidemic outbreaks limitations or regulations affecting trade flows local currency concerns and other economic and political instability political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees increased risks of corruption etc economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company’s operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies although the nature of many of the companys products ie food and feed ingredients is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycles the company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk and exposure analysis government relations and tax compliance activities and robust ethics compliance training requirements 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in more than 190 countries and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the united states federal government as well as state local and nonus governmental authorities in areas including accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime thereby significantly increasing the notional amount of the exposures 

the production of the company’s products uses materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions the company has programs and policies in place eg corporate sustainability program nodeforestation policy environmental policy etc to reduce its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires acquisition of technology at a cost to the company failure to comply can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 



in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations  for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases the implementation of imo 2020 low sulfur fuel oil requirements for ships or regulatory modernization of food safety laws  may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates regulations and trade agreements including taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates these policies can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products adversely affect the companys ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary fiscal trade and environmental policies laws regulations and acquisition approvals creating risks including but not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions eg brexit local labor conditions and regulations and safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets there has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged the company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the us and other sources to markets around the world increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world eg the uschina trade dispute iran sanctions could negatively impact the companys ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio government policies including but not limited to antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements and traceability can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully 

the company is subject to industryspecific risks which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the companys production shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling socially acceptable farming practices environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims the liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the company the company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety however risks to the companys reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability food safety occupational health and safety and environmental matters 



certain of the company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed the company is subject to risks associated with economic product quality feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry for example african swine fever which could adversely affect demand for the company’s products used as ingredients in feed in addition as the company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the companys customers 

the company is exposed to potential business disruption including but not limited to disruption of transportation services supply of noncommodity raw materials used in its processing operations and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war natural disasters severe weather conditions and accidents which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the company’s facilities and impair the company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner the company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively in addition if certain nonagricultural commodity raw materials such as water or certain chemicals used in the company’s processing operations are not available the company’s business could be disrupted any major lack of available water for use in certain of the company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results certain factors which may impact the availability of nonagricultural commodity raw materials are out of the company’s control including but not limited to disruptions resulting from weather high river water conditions economic conditions manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers shortage of materials interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions 

the assets and operations of the company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include but are not limited to acts of terrorism for example purposeful adulteration of the company’s products war natural disasters severe weather conditions accidents explosions and fires the company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the company’s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks in addition the company conforms to management systems such as international organization for standardization iso or other recognized global standards 

the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities the company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk management practices 

libor london interbank offered rate has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 the companys variable rate debt credit facilities certain derivative agreements and commercial agreements may use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates while it is not possible to predict the consequences of discontinuation or modification of libor at this time the companys financing costs could be adversely or positively impacted although the company does not expect that a transition from libor will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs the company continues to monitor developments

company overview 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

adm is a global leader in human and animal nutrition and one of the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing company it is one of the world’s leading producers of ingredients for human and animal nutrition and other products made from nature the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities connecting to markets in more than 190 countries the company also processes corn oilseeds and wheat into products for food animal feed chemical and energy uses the company also engages in the manufacturing sale and distribution of specialty products including natural flavor ingredients flavor systems natural colors proteins emulsifiers soluble fiber polyols hydrocolloids natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients the company uses its global asset network business acumen and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders principally from margins earned on these activities 

effective july 1 2019 the company changed its segment reporting to reflect the creation of the combined ag services and oilseeds segment the former origination and oilseeds businesses were merged into a combined ag services and oilseeds segment which enables the company to better respond to market changes by integrating the supply and value chains and risk management while delivering significant simplification and efficiency to the daytoday business as part of the company’s efforts for a streamlined management structure the combined segment is led by the former president of oilseeds expanding his role to president of ag services and oilseeds 

prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation 

the company’s operations are organized managed and classified into three reportable business segments ag services and oilseeds carbohydrate solutions and nutrition each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered the company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments as defined by the applicable accounting standard and are classified as other financial information with respect to the company’s reportable business segments is set forth in note 17 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 herein “financial statements and supplementary data” item 8 

the company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include

operating performance indicators 

the company’s ag services and oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials as a result changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues 

the company’s carbohydrate solutions operations and nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold therefore changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit thus gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil and argentina the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings gross margins segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies trade policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 



market factors influencing operations or results in the twelve months ended december 31 2019 

the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the companys operating results in ag services and oilseeds sales volumes and margins were negatively impacted by challenging north american weather conditions in particular high water in the mississippi river system in the first half of the year and the continuing global trade tensions with china handling volumes in north america were impacted by the late harvest as planting was delayed due to spring flooding continued good global meal demand resulted in strong global crushing volumes and solid margins south american origination volumes benefited from the uschina trade dispute but were also impacted by softer chinese demand due to the african swine fever impact on local feed demand and intermittent farmer selling global demand and margins for refined oil and biodiesel remained solid in carbohydrate solutions demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in north america while coproduct prices were stable although ethanol demand remained steady in north america margins were severely pressured as us industry ethanol production and stocks remained at high levels and us exports to china ceased during the trade dispute the severe weather conditions in north america also adversely impacted operations in the carbohydrate solutions business unit nutrition benefited from growing demand for flavors flavors systems human and pet health and wellness products and plantbased proteins but was negatively impacted by the african swine fever in asia pacific which also resulted in pricing pressures in the global lysine market 

year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

  

net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased 24 or 04 billion  to 14 billion  segment operating profit decreased 10 or 03 billion  to 29 billion  and included a net charge of 134 million consisting of asset impairment restructuring and settlement charges gains on sale of certain assets and a stepup gain on an equity investment included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of 89 million consisting of asset impairment restructuring and settlement charges and a net gain on sales of assets and businesses adjusted segment operating profit decreased 03 billion to 31 billion due to lower results in ag services crushing and carbohydrate solutions and lower equity earnings from wilmar partially offset by higher results in refined products and other and nutrition refined products and other in the current year included 270 million related to the biodiesel tax credit for 2018 and 2019 compared to 120 million for 2017 recorded in the prior year corporate results were a net charge of 14 billion in the current year and included restructuring and pension settlement and remeasurement charges of 159 million primarily related to early retirement and reorganization initiatives a loss on sale of the companys equity investment in cip of 101 million  and a charge of 37 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lastin firstout lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 18 million in the prior year corporate results in the prior year of 12 billion included a pension settlement charge of 117 million a 49 million charge related to a discontinued software project and restructuring charges of 24 million primarily related to the reorganization of it services 

income taxes of 209 million decreased 36 million  the company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was 132 compared to 119 for 2018  the low 2019 tax rate was primarily due to the impact of us tax credits including the 2018 and 2019 biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit signed into law in december 2019 the effective tax rate for 2018 included the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and the additional trueup adjustments related to the 2017 us tax reform along with certain favorable discrete tax items netting to a favorable 74 million

the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to local supply and demand conditions processed volumes of corn decreased slightly from the prior year levels primarily related to the production disruptions in the columbus nebraska corn processing plant due to flooding and production issues in the decatur illinois corn complex 



revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 



revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in market prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in ag services and oilseeds generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues increased 315 million to 647 billion due to overall higher sales volumes  32 billion  partially offset by lower sales prices  29 billion  the increase in sales volumes was due principally to soybeans wheat cotton and higher sales volumes of feed ingredients related to acquisitions the decrease in sales prices was due principally to soybeans meal and wheat ag services and oilseeds revenues decreased 2 to 487 billion due to lower sales prices  30 billion  partially offset by higher sales volumes  18 billion  carbohydrate solutions revenues decreased 4 to 99 billion due to lower sales volumes  04 billion  nutrition revenues increased 50 to 57 billion due to higher sales volumes  18 billion  primarily related to acquisitions and higher sales prices  01 billion  

cost of products sold increased 03 billion to 605 billion due to overall higher sales volumes partially offset by lower prices of commodities included in cost of products sold in the current year was a charge of 37 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 18 million in the prior year manufacturing expenses increased 03 billion to 57 billion due principally to new acquisitions

1 adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit excluding the listed specified items 



ag services and oilseeds operating profit decreased 4  ag services results were lower due to weaker north american grain margins and lower volumes in part due to challenging weather conditions and the uschina trade tensions results in the current period were negatively impacted by high water conditions in the first half of the year which limited grain movement and sales in north america slow farmer selling and lower chinese demand of south american origination in part due to african swine fever also impacted results crushing results were strong but down compared to the prior year lower executed crush margins around the globe drove lower results partially offset by favorable timing effects of approximately 102 million from hedges entered in the prior year refined products and other results were up compared to the prior period primarily due to the retroactive biodiesel tax credit of 270 million for 2018 and 2019 recorded in the current year compared to 120 million for 2017 recorded in the prior year strong demand and higher results from equity investments wilmar results were lower year over year 

carbohydrate solutions operating profit decreased 32  starches and sweeteners results were down primarily due to lower results in emea where margins were pressured due to low sugar prices and the turkish quota on starchbased sweeteners higher manufacturing costs at the decatur il complex and weaker margins in flour milling also contributed to the decrease bioproducts results were down due to significantly lower ethanol margins amid a continued unfavorable ethanol industry environment exacerbated by the lack of chinese demand for ethanol due to the uschina trade dispute 

nutrition operating profit increased 23  wild flavors and specialty ingredients results were higher year over year on strong sales and margin growth in north america and europe middle east africa and india emeai and contributions from acquisitions animal nutrition results were up driven largely by contributions from the acquisition of neovia partially offset by additional expenses related to inventory valuation of newlyacquired neovia and weaker lysine results 

other operating profit increased 47 primarily due to improved results from the companys futures commission brokerage business and captive insurance underwriting performance 

corporate results are as follows 



corporate results were a net charge of 14 billion in the current year compared to 12 billion in the prior year the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of 37 million in the current year compared to a credit of 18 million in the prior year interest expense  net increased 27 million due to higher borrowings to fund recent acquisitions partially offset by interest savings from crosscurrency swaps unallocated corporate costs decreased 13 million due principally to decreased performancerelated compensation accruals partially offset by higher spending on it business transformation growthrelated investments and readinessrelated projects loss on sale of asset related to the sale of the companys equity investment in cip expenses related to acquisitions in the current year consisted of expenses primarily related to the neovia acquisition compared to prior year’s expenses and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge certain acquisitions impairment restructuring and settlement charges in the current year included restructuring and pension settlement and remeasurement charges related to early retirement and reorganization initiatives impairment restructuring and settlement charges in the prior year included pension settlement charge of 117 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain us salaried retirees under the companys adm retirement plan a 49 million charge related to a discontinued software project and restructuring charges of 24 million primarily related to the reorganization of it services other charges in the current year included railroad maintenance expenses of 51 million  other charges in the prior year included foreign exchange losses which were partially offset by earnings from the companys equity investment in cip 



nongaap financial measures 

the company uses adjusted earnings per share eps adjusted earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit nongaap financial measures as defined by the sec to evaluate the company’s financial performance these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of specified items adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization adjusted for specified items the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted where applicable for specified items 

management believes that adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the companys operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better periodtoperiod comparability adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps earnings before income taxes and segment operating profit respectively the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap

derivatives – designated hedging activities 

the company from time to time uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month assuming normal market conditions the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been and is expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable income taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item then the changes in the market value of these exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues andor cost of products sold see note 5 in item 8 for additional information 

investments in affiliates 

the company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence these investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted where appropriate for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee generally the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20 ownership of the investee however the company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to ownership percentage board membership customer and vendor relationships and other arrangements if management used a different accounting method for these investments then the amount of earnings from affiliates the company recognizes may materially differ 

income taxes

deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company’s income statement the realization of the company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions the timing and amount of which are uncertain the company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial results valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely during 2019  the company increased valuation allowances by approximately 20 million primarily related to newlygenerated foreign tax loss carryforwards to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances the company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted

the act also contains new provisions related to global intangible low taxed income gilti and foreign derived intangible income fdii which were effective for fiscal year 2018 the company made an accounting policy election to treat gilti as a period cost during 2018 us tax authorities issued proposed treasury regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018 the company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as us tax authorities issue treasury regulations and other guidance addressing tax reformrelated changes it is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the act the additional guidance in the us along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the companys net income or cash flow 

property plant and equipment and asset abandonments and writedowns 

the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring transporting storing processing and merchandising agricultural commodities and products this business is global in nature and is highly capitalintensive both the availability of the company’s raw materials and the demand for the company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather plantings government programs and policies changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops these aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supplydemand dynamics for the company’s raw materials and finished products any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the company’s assets in terms of geographic location size and age of its facilities the company from time to time will also invest in equipment technology and companies related to new valueadded products produced from agricultural commodities and products these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective management evaluates the company’s property plant and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods during the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  impairment charges for property plant and equipment were 131 million  100 million  and 101 million  respectively 

business combinations 

the company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 805 business combinations as amended  the consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these are estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain the estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships trademarks and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models estimates in the discounted cash flow models include but are not limited to certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results eg revenue growth rates customer attrition rates and royalty rates these significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions during the measurement period which may take up to one year from the acquisition date adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed whichever comes first any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on october 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable the company adopted the provisions of asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  which permits but does not require a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting units fair value if after completing the qualitative assessment a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include but are not limited to future expected cash flows and discount rates definitelived intangible assets including capitalized expenses related to the companys 1adm program are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying values may not be fully recoverable the company recorded impairment charges totaling 11 million related to goodwill and intangibles and 9 million related to customer lists during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively there were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2017 see note 18 in item 8 for more information if management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 

employee benefit plans 

the company provides substantially all us employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans the company provides certain eligible us employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or health care reimbursement accounts 

in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans management makes several estimates and assumptions including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans rates of compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future health care costs these estimates and assumptions are based on the company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances management also uses thirdparty actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 

the company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses under the corridor approach net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods for plans with little to no active participants the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants for plans with active participants the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants the amortization periods range from 3 to 38 years for the companys defined benefit pension plans and from 6 to 22 years for the companys postretirement benefit plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 



the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an increase in prices underlying the weekly commodity position 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency and brazil and argentina where us dollar is the functional currency to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 



the amount the company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 96 billion and 87 billion  116 billion and 105 billion at historical rates at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of 11 billion partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 02 billion  the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 957 million and 870 million for december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2019 is primarily due to decreased interest rates

risk factors 

tableend

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance 

management directs a companywide enterprise risk management erm program with oversight from the company’s board of directors the company’s audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis 

the company through its business unit functional and corporate teams continually updates assesses monitors and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the erm program and as monitored by the erm program team and chief risk officer 

the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the erm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits 



the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by climate change weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations including impacts from factors outside the companys control such as changes in weather and climate crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition and changes in global demand the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities managementestablished limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting help to optimize results versus the company’s strategic plans additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities 

reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner for example a drought in argentina in 2017 and 2018 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased high and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on shortterm working capital funding conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection farming techniques or speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the company 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity online build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and in many cases subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the company has a significant presence and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market presence maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions 

fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 



the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas while 55 percent  of the company’s processing plants and 61 percent  of its procurement facilities are located in the united states the company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as western europe canada and brazil and emerging market areas one of the company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the company’s products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the company’s suppliers customers and other counterparties in addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges limitations or regulations affecting trade flows local currency concerns and other economic and political instability political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees increased risks of corruption etc economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company’s operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies the company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk and exposure analysis government relations and tax compliance activities and robust ethics compliance training requirements 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in more than 170  countries and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the united states federal government as well as state local and nonus governmental authorities in areas including accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime thereby significantly increasing the notional amount of the exposures 

the production of the company’s products use materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions the company has programs and policies in place eg corporate sustainability program nodeforestation policy environmental policy etc to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations as any failure to comply can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 

in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations  for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws  may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 



government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates regulations and trade agreements including taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates these policies can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products adversely affect the companys ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary fiscal trade and environmental policies laws regulations and acquisition approvals creating risks including but not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions local labor conditions and regulations and safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets there has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged the company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the us and other sources to markets around the world increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world eg the china trade tariffs iran sanctions could negatively impact the companys ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio government policies including but not limited to antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements and traceability can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully

the company is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling socially acceptable farming practices environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims the liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the company the company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety however risks to the companys reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability food safety occupational health and safety and environmental matters 

certain of the company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed the company is subject to risks associated with economic product quality feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry which could adversely affect demand for the company’s products used as ingredients in feed in addition as the company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the companys customers

the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities the company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk management practices

operating performance indicators 

the company’s origination and oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 

the company’s carbohydrate solutions operations and nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil and argentina the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies trade policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 



year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017   

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the companys operating results in 2018 markets were volatile amid escalating global trade tensions including the announcement of tariffs on chinese imports of us soybeans in origination strong demand for feedstuffs in light of weather conditions in northern europe resulted in higher sales volumes and margins in destination markets and strong basis positions across commodities resulted in higher margins in oilseeds dry conditions in argentina resulted in a smaller soybean crop which combined with continued good global meal demand resulted in strong global crushing margins and volumes south american origination volumes and margins benefited from stronger farmer selling demand and margins for refined oil remained solid and biodiesel margins improved excess global peanut supply resulted in weak peanut margins in carbohydrate solutions global demand and prices for starches and sweeteners remained solid in north america while coproduct prices were stable us ethanol industry production remained at high levels although ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanols continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer margins continue to remain under pressure nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems and from strong demand for and favorable margin development in certain nonflavor food businesses 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 13  or 02 billion  to 18 billion  segment operating profit increased 29  or 07 billion  to 33 billion  included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of 89 million  consisting of asset impairment restructuring and settlement charges and a net gain on sales of assets and businesses included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of 134 million  consisting of asset impairment and restructuring charges a net gain on sales of assets and businesses and corn hedge timing effects adjusted segment operating profit increased 07 billion  to 34 billion  due to an increase in sales prices and volumes of corn and meal improved margins in origination oilseeds and nutrition and the benefits of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018 partially offset by lower ethanol margins corporate results were a net charge of 12 billion  in the current year compared to 09 billion  in the prior year corporate results in the current year included a pension settlement charge of 117 million  a 49 million  charge related to a discontinued software project restructuring charges of 24 million  primarily related to the reorganization of it services and a credit of 18 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 2 million  in the prior year corporate results in the prior year also included 54 million  of restructuring charges primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the companys global workforce 

income taxes of 245 million  increased 238 million  due to a higher effective tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes the company’s effective tax rate for 2018  increased to 119  compared to 04  for 2017   due primarily to the low rate in 2017 that was impacted by favorable tax adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act totaling 379 million  the effective tax rate for the current year also included the final effects of the us tax reform and the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 along with certain favorable discrete tax items netting to a favorable 74 million  

analysis of statements of earnings 

processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  are as follows in metric tons 



the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to increasing global demand for oilseed products particularly meal and higher crushing volumes in north america due to the reduced soybean crop in argentina the overall decrease in corn is primarily related to decreased current year processing after the reconfiguration of the company’s peoria illinois ethanol complex in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and production issues in the decatur illinois corn complex in 2018 



revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  are as follows 



revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds and origination generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues increased 35 billion  or 6  to 643 billion  due principally to higher sales prices  23 billion  and higher sales volumes  12 billion  the increase in sales prices and volumes was due primarily to increases in corn and soybean meal origination revenues increased 4  to 251 billion  due to higher sales prices  21 billion  partially offset by lower sales volumes  12 billion  oilseeds revenues increased 11  to 248 billion  due to higher sales volumes  20 billion  and higher sales prices  04 billion  carbohydrate solutions revenues decreased 1  to 103 billion  due to lower sales prices  02 billion  partially offset by higher sales volumes  01 billion  nutrition revenues increased 8  to 38 billion  due to higher sales volumes  03 billion  

cost of products sold increased 29 billion  to 602 billion  due principally to higher sales volumes and higher prices for commodities included in cost of products sold was a credit of 18 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to 2 million  in the prior year manufacturing expenses increased 02 billion  to 54 billion  due principally to increased energy cost railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense and other individually insignificant increases in certain expense categories 

  

foreign currency translation impacts increased both revenues and cost of products sold by 04 billion  



gross profit increased 07 billion  or 19  to 42 billion  higher results in crushing and origination  490 million  refining packaging biodiesel and other  99 million  merchandising and handling  204 million  and wild flavors and specialty ingredients  76 million  were partially offset by lower results in bioproducts  103 million  and other  36 million  these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33 the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves had a positive impact on gross profit of 18 million  compared to 2 million  in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 9  to 22 billion  due principally to higher performancerelated compensation accruals and increased pension and projectrelated expenses 

asset impairment exit and restructuring costs decreased 2 million  to 171 million  current year charges consisted of 56 million  of impairment of certain longlived assets a 12 million  impairment of an equity investment a 21 million  impairment related to a longterm financing receivable and 9 million  of other individually insignificant impairment and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit and a 49 million  charge related to a discontinued software project 18 million  of restructuring charges related to the reorganization of it services and 6 million  of individually insignificant restructuring charges in corporate prior year charges consisted of 63 million of asset impairments related to the reconfiguration of the companys peoria illinois ethanol complex 20 million of asset impairments related to the closure of a facility and 36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit and 54 million of restructuring charges in corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the companys global workforce 

  

interest expense increased 34 million  to 364 million  primarily due to higher interest rates on shortterm debt and higher borrowings 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 62 million  to 518 million  due to earnings from a new equity investment and higher earnings from the company’s equity investments in cip and olenex partially offset by lower earnings from other equity investments 

other expense  net of 101 million  increased 111 million  from net income of 10 million  current year expense included foreign exchange losses and a noncash pension settlement charge of 117 million  related to the purchase of a group annuity contract that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain us salaried retirees under the companys adm retirement plan these expenses were partially offset by gains on disposals of businesses an equity investment and individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business and other income prior year net income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business changes in contingent settlement provisions a charge related to the early redemption of the companys 559 million notes due march 15 2018 and foreign exchange losses 



segment operating profit adjusted segment operating profit a nongaap measure and earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  are as follows 



1  adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit excluding the listed specified items 



origination operating profit increased 35  merchandising and handling was up significantly yearoveryear global trade delivered strong results due to increased volumes strong margins and improved opportunities in the soybean and feedstuff value chain north american grain was up due to improved margins and higher volumes transportation was up due primarily to higher freight rates 

oilseeds operating profit increased 79  crushing and origination results increased due to a strong global demand and margin environment the reduced soybean crop in argentina combined with continued good global meal demand resulted in strong crushing margins and volumes south america saw strong origination volumes and improving margins as farmer selling accelerated refining packaging biodiesel and other results were higher mainly due to the 2017 biodiesel tax credit of approximately 120 million  which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018 solid biodiesel results and higher earnings from the company’s investment in olenex partially offset by weaker peanut shelling margins primarily caused by large peanut inventories and difficult market conditions asia results increased due to higher earnings from the company’s investment in wilmar 

carbohydrate solutions operating profit decreased 12  starches and sweeteners results decreased due to lower margins and volumes in liquid sweeteners mainly due to production issues in the decatur illinois corn complex partially offset by improved results from starches and dry sweeteners bioproducts results were down as near record industry fuel ethanol inventories pressured margins and production issues in the decatur il corn complex increased costs partially offset by effective ethanol risk management 

nutrition operating profit increased 9  wild flavors and specialty ingredients results were up due to improved earnings across the segment and higher sales volumes related to contributions from new acquisitions and organic growth in wild flavors an improved portfolio mix boosted sales and margins health and wellness improved driven largely by increased contributions from bioactives specialty ingredients was up due to improved volumes and margins in proteins and increased sales in fibers partially offset by lower results in polyols animal nutrition was down due to operational issues in decatur il that constrained lysine production volumes and increased manufacturing costs partially offset by improved premix and commercial feed margins 

other operating profit increased 14  primarily due to stronger results from its futures commission brokerage business due to higher shortterm interest rates partially offset by lower underwriting results from the company’s captive insurance operations during the first half of 2018 

corporate results are as follows 





corporate results were a net charge of 12 billion  in the current year compared to 09 billion  in the prior year the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of 18 million  in the current year compared to a credit of 2 million  in the prior year interest expense  net increased 11 million  due to higher interest rates on shortterm debt and higher borrowings partially offset by interest income related to a tax credit and lowertax related expense unallocated corporate costs increased 190 million  due principally to higher performancerelated compensation accruals increased pension and projectrelated expenses and railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense acquisitionrelated expenses in the current year related to expenses and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge certain acquisitions loss on debt extinguishment in the prior period related to the early redemption of the 559 million aggregate principal amount of 545 notes due on march 15 2018 impairment restructuring and settlement charges in the current year included a pension settlement charge of 117 million  a 49 million  charge related to a discontinued software project and restructuring charges of 24 million  primarily related to the reorganization of it services compared to restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the company’s global workforce of 54 million  in the prior year other charges decreased 32 million  primarily due to improved results in the company’s investment in cip and lower nonservice cost related pension expenses 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses adjusted earnings per share eps adjusted earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit nongaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission to evaluate the company’s financial performance these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of specified items adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization adjusted for specified items the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted where applicable for specified items 

management believes that adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the companys operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better periodtoperiod comparability adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps earnings before income taxes and segment operating profit respectively the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the companys operating results in origination us export competitiveness was strong during the first half of 2017 but weakened during the second half due to the large crops in south america overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global market in carbohydrate solutions demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in north america while coproduct prices were stable ethanol continues to face a challenging environment although ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanols continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer us industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins global oilseeds processing volumes remained strong but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured margins slow selling by farmers in brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes while demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions uncertainty surrounding the us biodiesel tax credit has negatively impacted biodiesel margins nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems but continued to be adversely affected by startup costs and margin pressure in certain nonflavor food ingredient markets 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 03 billion to 16 billion segment operating profit decreased 02 billion to 25 billion included in segment operating profit in 2017 was a net charge of 134 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses impairment restructuring and settlement charges and corn hedge timing effects included in segment operating profit in 2016 was income of 81 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businessesrevaluation impairment and restructuring charges and corn hedge timing effects adjusted segment operating profit increased 47 million to 27 billion due to solid results in carbohydrate solutions partially offset by weaker south american origination margins lower soybean crush margins and weaker results in some specialty ingredients corporate results were a net charge of 927 million in 2017 compared to 882 million in 2016 corporate results in 2017 included a credit of 2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of 19 million in 2016 

income taxes decreased 527 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate the company’s effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 04 compared to 293 for 2016 due primarily to the estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” excluding the impact of the act the companys effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 293 to approximately 240 due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items including the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the expiration of us tax credits including the biodiesel credit at the end of 2016 see note 13 in item 8 for more information 

analysis of statements of earnings 

processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  are as follows in metric tons 



the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil the overall increase in corn is due to the strong demand environment for ethanol partially offset by the production disruption in one of the company’s plants due to a water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the company’s peoria illinois ethanol complex 



revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  are as follows

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 





the change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an increase in prices underlying the weekly commodity position partially offset by a decrease in quantities

the amount the company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 87 billion  and 82 billion   105 billion  and 94 billion  at historical rates at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of 11 billion  partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 06 billion  the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 870 million  and 820 million  for december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2018  is primarily due to increased borrowings

risk factors 

tableend

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance 

management directs a companywide enterprise risk management erm program with oversight from the company’s board of directors the company’s audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis 

the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the erm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits 



the company through its business unit functional and corporate teams continually updates assesses monitors and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the erm program and as monitored by the erm program team and chief risk officer 

the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities these commodity trade teams monitor commodity positions against management established limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting to ensure optimized results versus the company’s strategic plans additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the company in its operations is maintained these factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and consequently in the company’s operating results and working capital requirements reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weatherrelated factors or other reasons could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner for example a drought in north america in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased high and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection technology farming techniques or speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the company 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent additionally competitors offer similar products and services as well as alternative products and services to the company’s customers the company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins profits and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating working capital dividend or capital expenditure needs competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity online build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities the markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the company’s significant origination processing and export footprint and the company’s operating results improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the company has a significant presence in addition continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the company especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market share maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions 



fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas while 56 percent  of the company’s processing plants and 74 percent  of its procurement facilities are located in the united states the company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as western europe canada and brazil and emerging market areas such as eastern europe asia portions of south and central america the middle east and africa one of the company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as asia eastern europe the middle east and africa both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the company’s products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the company’s suppliers customers and other counterparties in addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges limitations or regulations affecting trade flows such as concerning genetically modified organisms local currency concerns and other economic and political instability political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees increased risks of corruption etc economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company’s operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies thus reducing the company’s overall market value the company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk analysis government relations and tax compliance activities and active ethics compliance training requirements 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in more than 170  countries the company is required to comply with the numerous and farreaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal state local and foreign governmental authorities the company must comply with other general business regulations covering areas such as accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company as examples the company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company covering various prior periods any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation 

the production of the company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions although the company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure compliance with laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 



in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results

company overview 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company is principally engaged in procuring transporting storing processing and merchandising agricultural commodities products and ingredients the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities connecting to markets in more than 170  countries the company also processes corn oilseeds and wheat into products for food animal feed chemical and energy uses the company uses its global asset network business acumen and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders principally from margins earned on these activities 

the company’s operations are organized managed and classified into four reportable business segments agricultural services corn processing oilseeds processing and wild flavors and specialty ingredients each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered the company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments as defined by the applicable accounting standard and are classified as other see note 17 of item 8 for more information about the company’s business segments 

the company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include 

 

as part of the implementation of the company’s strategic plan the company continues to evaluate the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio seeking ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to reduce volatility of earnings and drive longterm returns 

operating performance indicators 

the company’s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 



the company’s corn processing operations and wild flavors and specialty ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies trade policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the companys operating results in agricultural services us export competitiveness was strong during the first half of the year but weakened during the second half due to the large crops in south america overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global market in corn processing demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in north america while coproduct prices were stable ethanol continues to face a challenging environment although ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanols continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer us industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins global oilseeds processing volumes remained strong but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured margins slow selling by farmers in brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes while demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions uncertainty surrounding the us biodiesel tax credit has negatively impacted biodiesel margins wild flavors and specialty ingredients benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems but continued to be adversely affected by startup costs and margin pressure in certain nonflavor food ingredient markets 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 03 billion  to 16 billion  segment operating profit decreased 02 billion  to 25 billion  included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of 134 million  consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses impairment restructuring and settlement charges and corn hedge timing effects included in segment operating profit in the prior year was income of 81 million  consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businessesrevaluation impairment and restructuring charges and corn hedge timing effects adjusted segment operating profit increased 47 million  to 27 billion  due to solid results in corn processing partially offset by weaker south american origination margins lower soybean crush margins and weaker results in some specialty ingredients corporate results were a net expense of 927 million  in the current year compared to 882 million  in the prior year corporate results in the current year included a credit of 2 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of 19 million  in the prior year 

income taxes decreased 527 million  due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate the company’s effective tax rate for 2017  decreased to 04  compared to 293  for 2016  due primarily to the estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” excluding the impact of the act the companys effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 293  to approximately 240  due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items including the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the expiration of us tax credits including the biodiesel credit at the end of 2016 see note 13 in item 8 for more information 



analysis of statements of earnings 

processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  are as follows in metric tons 



the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil the overall increase in corn is due to the strong demand environment for ethanol partially offset by the production disruption in one of the company’s plants due to a water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the company’s peoria illinois ethanol complex 

revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  are as follows 



revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 



revenues decreased 15 billion  or 2  to 608 billion  due to lower sales volumes  14 billion  and lower average sales prices  01 billion  the decrease in sales volumes was due principally to a decrease in volumes of unprocessed commodities in particular volumes of soybeans corn rapeseed and wheat agricultural services revenues decreased 6  to 262 billion  due to lower sales volumes  15 billion  and lower average sales prices  01 billion  corn processing revenues decreased 1  to 94 billion  due to lower sales volumes  01 billion  oilseeds processing revenues increased 2  to 225 billion  due to higher sales volumes  03 billion  wild flavors and specialty ingredients revenues decreased 5  to 23 billion  due to lower sales volumes  01 billion  

cost of products sold decreased 14 billion  to 573 billion  due principally to lower sales volumes included in cost of products sold is a credit of 2 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of 19 million  in the prior year manufacturing expenses increased 01 billion  to 52 billion  due to increased expenses for energy operating and maintenance supplies and contracted labor and higher salaries and benefits 

  

gross profit decreased 01 billion  or 3  to 35 billion  lower results in soybean processing  152 million  and grain origination  90 million  were partially offset by higher results in canola processing  41 million  sweeteners and starches  71 million  and animal nutrition  53 million  these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 31 the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves had a 2 million  positive impact on gross profit compared to a negative impact of 19 million  in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses of 20 billion  were comparable to the prior year current year expenses included increased salaries and benefits cost related to further investments in the company’s business transformation it research and development and innovation initiatives prior year expenses included expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 164 million  to 456 million  primarily due to higher earnings from the company’s investment in wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from wilmar and improved results from the company’s equity investment in cip partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings resulting from the disposal of an equity investment 

other income  net decreased 110 million  to 37 million  prior year income included realized additional consideration related to the sale of the companys equity investment in gruma sab de cv in december 2012 recovery of loss provisions and gain related to the sale of the companys brazilian sugar ethanol facilities a gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of amazon flavors and loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets current period income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business changes in contingent settlement provisions a charge related to the full redemption of the companys 559 million notes due march 15 2018 and foreign exchange losses

corn processing operating profit increased 19  sweeteners and starches operating profit increased due to improved domestic demand and higher volumes and margins from the international business bioproducts profit increased due to improved lysine margins and higher trading resuts partially offset by lower volumes caused by a mild winter and slightly lower ethanol margins 

oilseeds processing operating profit decreased 4  crushing and origination operating profit decreased from the prior year higher softseed results in north america and europe were more than offset by weaker soybean crush margins due to ample supply of alternative proteins competing with soybean meal in addition improved south american soybean crushing results were more than offset by weak grain origination margins throughout the year refining packaging biodiesel and other operating profit declined due to weaker biodiesel and specialty oils margins partially offset by higher results in south american packaged oils and the global peanut business asia results increased on higher earnings from the company’s investment in wilmar due to the increased ownership stake in and higher results from wilmar 

wild flavors and specialty ingredients wfsi operating profit increased 3  the continuing strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems across all regions were partially offset by lower results in specialty ingredients due in part to operational startup costs 

other operating profit decreased 62  primarily due to losses from the companys captive insurance operations and lower results from its futures commission brokerage business current year results included settlement of insurance claims from the companys agricultural services segment totaling 50 million  related to the new orleans louisiana export facility 

corporate results were a net expense of 927 million  in the current year compared to 882 million  in the prior year the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of 2 million  in the current year compared to a charge of 19 million  in the prior year interest expense  net increased 28 million  due principally to higher interest rates on shortterm debt the issuance of 1 billion fixedrate debt in august 2016 and interest related to an amended foreign income tax return from a prior year partially offset by the retirement of the 261 million bond that matured in april 2017 and the absence of the original harvest innovation adjustment of buyout liability in may 2016 unallocated corporate costs increased 13 million  due principally to increased investments in the company’s business transformation it research and development and innovation initiatives partially offset by the absence of last year’s railroad maintenance expense other charges in the current year included a charge related to the full redemption of the company’s 559 million notes due on march 15 2018 and restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the company’s global workforce other charges in the prior year included legal settlement costs and legal fees a software impairment charge otherthantemporary impairment charges on the company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities a loss on the sale of an investment and other asset impairment and restructuring charges partially offset by a gain related to a us retiree medical benefit plan curtailment minority interest and other expense increased 12 million  due principally to lower results from the companys equity investment in cip 



nongaap financial measures 

the company uses adjusted earnings per share eps adjusted earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit nongaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission to evaluate the company’s financial performance these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of certain specified items adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes interest and depreciation and amortization adjusted for specified items the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted where applicable for specified items 

management believes that adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the companys operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better periodtoperiod comparability adjusted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps earnings before income taxes and segment operating profit respectively the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap

revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  are as follows 



revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues decreased 54 billion or 8 to 623 billion due to lower average sales prices 35 billion including 06 billion in foreign currency translation impacts and lower overall sales volumes 19 billion the decrease in sales prices was due principally to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices in particular prices of corn soybeans and soybeanrelated products the decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and south american grain and oilseed origination agricultural services revenues decreased 6 to 279 billion due to lower average sales prices 25 billion partially offset by higher sales volumes 07 billion corn processing revenues decreased 5 to 95 billion due to lower sales volumes 05 billion due principally to ethanol and the sale of the sugar ethanol business partially offset by sales volumes from the acquisition of eaststarch cv oilseeds processing revenues decreased 12 to 222 billion due to lower average sales prices 08 billion and lower sales volumes 23 billion principally due to south american grains and oilseeds and the sale of the cocoa business wfsi revenues were flat due to lower average sales prices 02 billion which were offset by higher sales volumes 02 billion

gross profit decreased 03 billion or 9 to 36 billion the decrease in gross profit consisted principally of lower soy crush margins 309 million reduced merchandising results 95 million primarily due to agricultural services global trade execution and positioning losses lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations 24 million the sale of the cocoa business in 2015 78 million partially offset by contribution of the recent eaststarch cv acquisition 85 million and higher results in sweeteners and starches 169 million these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 38 the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves had a 19 million negative impact on gross profit compared to a positive impact of 2 million in 2015 the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold 

selling general and administrative expenses of 20 billion were comparable to 2015 decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business and a us retiree medical benefit plan curtailment gain were offset by legal settlements costs and legal fees increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business and expenses for the recently consolidated eaststarch cv

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased 98 million to 292 million primarily due to lower earnings from the company’s investments in wilmar and cip and a decrease in equity earnings from eaststarch cv which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in november 2015 partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees 

other income  net decreased 203 million to 147 million income in 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of 256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa chocolate and lactic businesses a gain of 212 million on the revaluation of the company’s previously held equity investments in north star shipping minmetal and eaststarch cv in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests and a gain of 62 million on the sale of a 50 interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc partially offset by a 189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and loss provisions of 45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil income in 2016 included 48 million of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the company’s equity investment in gruma sab de cv in december 2012 a 59 million gain including recovery of loss provisions related to the sale of the company’s brazilian sugar ethanol facilities a 12 million gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of amazon flavors and a 10 million loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 

the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 





the change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an increase in prices underlying the weekly commodity position and to a lesser extent an increase in quantities 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland and brazil where the euro and us dollar are the functional currencies respectively to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 

the amount the company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 82 billion  and 73 billion   94 billion  and 93 billion  at historical rates at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase is due to the appreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 08 billion  and the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of 01 billion  the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 820 million  and 728 million  for december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2017 is primarily due to decreased interest rates

risk factors 

tableend

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance 

management directs a companywide integrated risk management irm program with oversight from the company’s board of directors the company’s audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis 

the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the irm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits 

the company through its business unit functional and corporate teams continually updates assesses monitors and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the irm program and as monitored by the irm program and chief risk officer 



the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops the company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities these commodity trade teams monitor commodity positions against management established limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting to ensure optimized results versus the company’s strategic plans additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the company in its operations is maintained these factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and consequently in the company’s operating results and working capital requirements reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weatherrelated factors or other reasons could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner for example a drought in north america in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased high and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 

advances in technology such as seed and crop protection technology farming techniques or speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of the company and other agricultural merchandisers 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent additionally competitors offer similar products and services as well as alternative products and services to the company’s customers the company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins profits and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating working capital dividend or capital expenditure needs competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring online idled capacity build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities the markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the company’s significant origination processing and export footprint and the company’s operating results improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the company has a significant presence in addition continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the company especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market share maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions 



fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results the company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins 

the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas while 56 percent  of the company’s processing plants and 73 percent  of its procurement facilities are located in the united states the company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as western europe canada brazil and emerging market areas such as eastern europe asia portions of south and central america the middle east and africa one of the company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as asia eastern europe the middle east and africa both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the company’s products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the company’s suppliers customers and other counterparties in addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges limitations or regulations affecting trade flows such as concerning genetically modified organisms local currency concerns and other economic and political instability political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees increased risks of corruption etc economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company’s operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies thus reducing the company’s overall market value the company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk analysis government relations and tax compliance activities and active ethics compliance training requirements 

the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in 163  countries the company is required to comply with the numerous and farreaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal state and local and foreign governmental authorities the company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company as examples the company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company covering various prior periods any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation 

the production of the company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions although the company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure compliance with laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 



in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates and regulations governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry such as taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products adversely affect the companys ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in other governmental policies mandates and regulations including monetary fiscal and environmental policies laws regulations acquisition approvals and other activities of governments agencies and similar organizations these risks include but are not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions local labor conditions and regulations safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results there has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged the company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the us and other sources to markets around the world should there be an increase in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world the company could be negatively impacted from its inability to enter certain markets or the price of the products being less competitive in the destination markets 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio government policies including antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements traceability and other government regulations and mandates can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully

the company is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling socially acceptable farming practices environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims the liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the company in addition negative publicity caused by product liability food safety occupational health and safety and environmental matters may damage the company’s reputation the company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety however the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 



certain of the company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed the company is subject to risks associated with economic product quality feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry an outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed a decrease in demand for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results in addition as the company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the companys customers 

the company is exposed to potential business disruption including but not limited to disruption of transportation services supply of noncommodity raw materials used in its processing operations and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war natural disasters severe weather conditions and accidents which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services a disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the company’s facilities and impair the company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner the company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively if access to these navigable waters is interrupted the company’s operating results could be adversely affected in addition if certain nonagricultural commodity raw materials such as water or certain chemicals used in the company’s processing operations are not available the company’s business could be disrupted any major lack of available water for use in certain of the company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results certain factors which may impact the availability of nonagricultural commodity raw materials are out of the company’s control including but not limited to disruptions resulting from weather economic conditions manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers shortage of materials interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions 

the assets and operations of the company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include but are not limited to acts of terrorism for example economic adulteration of the company’s products or war natural disasters and severe weather conditions accidents explosions and fires the potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results the company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the company’s products in supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks in addition the company conforms to management systems such as international organization for standardization iso or other recognized global standards 

the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results the company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk management practices

company overview 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company is principally engaged in procuring transporting storing processing and merchandising agricultural commodities and products the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities connecting to markets in 163  countries the company also processes corn oilseeds and wheat into products for food animal feed chemical and energy uses the company uses its global asset network business acumen and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders principally from margins earned on these activities 

the company’s operations are organized managed and classified into four reportable business segments agricultural services corn processing oilseeds processing and wild flavors and specialty ingredients each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered the company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments as defined by the applicable accounting standard and are classified as other see note 17 of item 8 for more information about the company’s business segments 

the company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include 

 

as part of the implementation of the company’s strategic plan the company continues to evaluate the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio seeking ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive longterm returns 

operating performance indicators 

the company’s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 

the company’s corn processing operations and wild flavors and specialty ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 



the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 76  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the companys operating results agricultural services was negatively impacted in the first half of the year by weak us grain export competitiveness and decreased global merchandising opportunities starting in the third quarter export volumes and margins improved due to the us harvest and weather conditions in south america in corn processing global demand for sweeteners and starches and us exports principally to mexico continued to grow in europe raw material costs improved resulting in improved margins cornbased ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel and domestic blending was strong as us gasoline demand was up compared to 2015 us ethanol also continued to be the one of the cheapest oxygenates in the world driving strong export volumes throughout 2016 industry production levels remained high during the year limiting margins in oilseeds processing global crushing operations achieved strong capacity utilization although margins were weaker mainly due to higher supply of soybean meal from argentina and other protein meal substitutes softseed margins improved due to better seed supply and oil demand vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry additionally vegetable oil sales volumes benefited from demand driven by the us 2016 biodiesel blenders credit the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business benefited from increased demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems specialty proteins natural health and nutrition products and polyols but was adversely impacted by soft market conditions in nonflavor food ingredient markets and a strong us dollar as well as operational issues at the specialty commodities unit 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased 06 billion  to 13 billion  segment operating profit decreased 06 billion  to 27 billion  primarily due to the prior year gain on sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses and lower earnings in the current year due to the sale of those businesses weaker global crushing and origination margins and lower international merchandising results partially offset by better ethanol results corporate results in the current year include a charge of 19 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 2 million  in the prior year and a decrease of approximately 70 million in the company’s share of the results of compagnie industrielle et financiere des produits amylaces sa luxembourg cip 

income taxes increased 96 million  due to a higher effective tax rate partially offset by lower earnings before income taxes the company’s effective tax rate for 2016 increased to 293  compared to 192  for 2015 due primarily to low tax rates on significant gains related to portfolio actions in 2015 a 71 million  prior year discrete tax benefit resulting mainly from the release of a 66 million valuation allowance compared to a 49 million  discrete tax expense in the current year and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings see note 13 in item 8 for more information 



analysis of statements of earnings 

processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  are as follows in metric tons 



the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions the overall decrease in corn relates to the disposal of the sugar ethanol operations in may 2016 partially offset by volumes from the acquisition of eaststarch cv in november 2015 

following the sale of the cocoa business in october 2015 the remaining results of cocoa and other were combined with the results of refining packaging biodiesel and other within the oilseeds processing segment effective january 1 2016 prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  are as follows 





revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues decreased 54 billion  or 8  to 623 billion  due to lower average sales prices  35 billion  including 06 billion  in foreign currency translation impacts and lower overall sales volumes  19 billion  the decrease in sales prices was due principally to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices in particular prices of corn soybeans and soybeanrelated products the decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and south american grain and oilseed origination agricultural services revenues decreased 6  to 279 billion  due to lower average sales prices  25 billion  partially offset by higher sales volumes  07 billion  corn processing revenues decreased 5  to 95 billion  due to lower sales volumes  05 billion  due principally to ethanol and the sale of the sugar ethanol business partially offset by sales volumes from the acquisition of eaststarch cv oilseeds processing revenues decreased 12  to 222 billion  due to lower average sales prices  08 billion  and lower sales volumes  23 billion  principally due to south american grains and oilseeds and the sale of the cocoa business wfsi revenues were flat due to lower average sales prices  02 billion  which were offset by higher sales volumes  02 billion  

cost of products sold decreased 50 billion  to 587 billion  due principally to lower average commodity costs including 06 billion  in foreign currency translation impacts and lower manufacturing costs included in cost of products sold is a charge of 19 million  from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 2 million  in the prior year manufacturing expenses decreased 02 billion  to 52 billion  primarily due to the sale of the cocoa business lower energy usage and prices and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses 

gross profit decreased 03 billion  or 8  to 37 billion  the decrease in gross profit consists principally of lower soy crush margins  309 million  reduced merchandising results  95 million  primarily due to agricultural services global trade execution and positioning losses lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations  24 million  the sale of the cocoa business in the prior period  78 million  partially offset by contribution of the recent eaststarch cv acquisition  85 million  and higher results in sweeteners and starches  169 million  these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 31 the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves had a 19 million  negative impact on gross profit compared to a positive impact of 2 million  in the prior year the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold 

selling general and administrative expenses of 20 billion  were comparable to the prior year decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business and a us retiree medical benefit plan curtailment gain were offset by legal settlements costs and legal fees increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business and expenses for the recently consolidated eaststarch cv 

asset impairment exit and restructuring costs decreased 145 million  to 55 million  prior year charges include longlived asset impairments of 129 million related to certain oilseeds processing facilities sugar ethanol facilities in brazil a facility in the corn processing segment and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of 71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement sugar ethanol facilities in brazil and several individually insignificant restructuring and exit costs current year charges include 11 million  of software impairment in corporate 6 million  of otherthantemporary impairment charges on the company’s investment in two available for sale equity securities in corporate and 17 million  and 21 million  of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges respectively 

interest expense declined 15 million  to 293 million  primarily due to lower interest rates on longterm debt and the 8 million effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10 interest in harvest innovations 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased 98 million  to 292 million  primarily due to lower earnings from the company’s investments in wilmar and cip and a decrease in equity earnings from eaststarch cv which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in november 2015 partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees 



other income  net decreased 203 million  to 147 million  prior year income consisted primarily of gain on sales of 256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa chocolate and lactic businesses a gain of 212 million on the revaluation of the company’s previously held equity investments in north star shipping minmetal and eaststarch cv in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests and a gain of 62 million on the sale of a 50 interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc partially offset by a 189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and loss provisions of 45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil current year income includes 48 million  of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the company’s equity investment in gruma sab de cv in december 2012 a 59 million  gain including recovery of loss provisions related to the sale of the company’s brazilian sugar ethanol facilities a 12 million  gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of amazon flavors and a 10 million  loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets 

operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016  and 2015  are as follows 





corporate results are as follows 



agricultural services operating profit decreased 16  merchandising and handling operating results declined primarily due to compressed grain handling margins in the first half of 2016 international merchandising results were down driven by poor execution and low market volatility which limited forward merchandising opportunities strong origination results in argentina and the addition of destination marketing in egypt through the company’s medsofts joint venture were partially offset by the absence of a 27 million prior year gain on the revaluation of the company’s previously held investments in north star shipping and minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest milling and other results increased 12  current period results include additional realized consideration related to the sale of the company’s equity investment in gruma sab de cv in december 2012 of 48 million  transportation operating profit declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company’s operating results agricultural services was negatively impacted by the ample global supply of agricultural commodities which limited merchandising opportunities reduced demand for north american grain exports and moderated commodity prices throughout the year 2015 the increase in global supply was due to several large harvests which built up world grain stocks to historically high levels in addition the us dollar continued to be firm against weakening global currencies particularly those in major crop growing countries such as brazil argentina and ukraine this resulted in margin pressure and decreased north american export volumes most of 2015 partially offset by higher domestic grain demand transportation was also impacted by the decreased north american export volumes as well as lower global freight rates demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid while coproduct prices weakened ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol’s continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer despite strong demand ethanol margins were weak due to recordhigh levels of us industry production for most 2015 leading to excess inventory overall demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong especially in north america south american oilseeds saw significantly higher volumes and margins for grain origination and exports due to the significant depreciation of the brazilian real against the us dollar lower softseed availability affected seed basis resulting in lower softseed crushing volumes and weaker margins particularly in europe biodiesel demand resulting from international biofuel standards continued to support demand for crude and refined vegetable oil although demand for biodiesel was softer throughout 2015 due to weaker economic conditions in certain countries the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities amid economic uncertainty in many emerging economies and some softening in demand customers’ interest to develop innovative healthy and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased 04 billion to 18 billion segment operating profit was down 16 due primarily to weaker ethanol margins and lower volumes and margins of north american grain exports corporate results in 2015 include a charge of 189 million related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in addition to a credit of 2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a lifo credit of 245 million in 2014 

income taxes decreased from 877 million to 438 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a decreased effective tax rate the company’s effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 19 compared to 28 for 2014 due primarily to low tax rates on significant onetime gains related to portfolio actions a 70 million favorable impact of discrete items mainly the release of a 66 million valuation allowance and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings

the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions record volumes of oilseeds were processed during 2015 increased from 2014 as a result of the strong demand environment for soybean meal processed volumes of corn decreased in response to high ethanol industry production which outpaced demand throughout the year 2015 

following the sale of the cocoa business in october 2015 the remaining results of cocoa and other were combined with the results of refining packaging biodiesel and other within the oilseeds processing segment effective january 1 2016 results prior to january 1 2016 have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  are as follows 





revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues decreased 17 due principally to lower sales prices 129 billion and lower sales volumes 06 billion sales prices decreased principally due to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices in particular prices of soybeans corn and wheat and 58 billion in foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the us dollar agricultural services revenues decreased 18 primarily due to lower sales prices 53 billion and lower sales volumes 13 billion corn processing revenues decreased 19 due principally to lower sales prices 19 billion and lower sales volumes 04 billion oilseeds processing revenues decreased 18 due principally to lower sales prices 55 billion and lower sales volumes 02 billion wild flavors and specialty ingredients revenues increased 76 due principally to higher sales volumes resulting from the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 12 billion partially offset by lower prices 02 billion 

cost of products sold decreased 128 billion to 637 billion due principally to lower average commodity prices including 56 billion from foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the us dollar and lower manufacturing costs included in cost of products sold is a credit of 2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 245 million in 2014 manufacturing expenses decreased 291 million to 55 billion primarily due to lower fuel prices partially offset by increased employee benefit costs due to the inclusion of the full year costs for wild flavors and sci 

gross profit decreased 07 billion or 16 to 40 billion due principally to lower ethanol margins 06 billion and foreign currency translation impacts 02 billion the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci was partially offset by lower credit from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo valuation reserves these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 38 the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 106 million to 20 billion due principally to increased expenses of 219 million related to the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci in 2015 compared to threemonth results in 2014 partially offset by decreased pension expense primarily due to a 98 million onetime pension settlement in 2014

interest expense declined 29 million to 308 million primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from the issuance of eurodenominated debt and the repurchase of certain of the company’s us dollardenominated outstanding debentures 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 18 million to 390 million primarily due to higher earnings from the company’s investment in cip

wild flavors and specialty ingredients operating profit increased due primarily to the acquisitions of wild flavors and sci during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 incremental earnings from these acquisitions were partially offset by lower overall results in the other specialty ingredients businesses due to weakness in many emerging economies and a strong us dollar which reduced volumes and margins across a number of product lines 



corporate results were a net charge of 988 million in 2015 compared to 785 million in 2014 the effects of changing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of 2 million in 2015 compared to a credit of 245 million in 2014 interest expense  net declined due principally to lower interest rates unallocated corporate costs increased 19 million due primarily to increased pension expense resulting from the adoption of a new mortality assumption increased spending on the company’s erp program and various strategic business improvement projects partially offset by lower employee compensation expense other charges in 2015 consisted of a 189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt restructuring charges of 29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement and asset impairment and settlement charges of 24 million other charges in 2014 consisted of a 102 million loss on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition costs associated with the relocation of the company’s global headquarters to chicago illinois of 16 million restructuring charges related to the alfred c toepfer international integration and other restructuring charges of 15 million and pension settlement of 98 million minority interest and other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of a 56 million loss related to the company’s equity method investment in cip

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 

the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

  

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 





the change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of a decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 76  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland and brazil where the euro and us dollar are the functional currencies respectively to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 

the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 73 billion  and 80 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 04 billion  and the decrease in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of 03 billion  the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 728 million  and 809 million  for december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the fair value of longterm debt increased primarily due to the 10 billion new debt issued on august 11 2016

status of new products 

the company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products recent acquisitions especially in the wild flavors and specialty ingredients segment expand the company’s ability to serve the customers’ evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products the company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the company’s revenues in 2016 

source and availability of raw materials 

substantially all of the company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities in any single year the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops the company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers grain elevators and wholesale merchants in north america south america europe asia australia and africa pursuant primarily to shortterm less than one year agreements or on a spot basis the company is not dependent upon any particular grower elevator or merchant as a source for its raw materials 



patents trademarks and licenses 

the company owns patents trademarks and licenses including approximately 209 million of trademarks from the wild flavors acquisition in 2014 but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents trademarks or licenses 

seasonality working capital needs and significant customers 

since the company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services there is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles procurement and transportation of the company’s principal raw materials oilseeds corn wheat sugarcane and other grains 

  

the prices of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly directly affect the company’s working capital requirements because the company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere principally north america and europe relative to the southern hemisphere primarily south america inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels no material part of the company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers the company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world typically advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest 

competition 

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price foreign exchange rates quality global supply and alternative products some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the company given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses the company on an ongoing basis focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements productivity enhancements and regular evaluation of the company’s asset portfolio 

research and development expenditures 

the company’s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers’ product development or formulation needs improving processing efficiency and developing food feed fuel and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops research and development expense during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  net of reimbursements of government grants was approximately 122 million  79 million  and 59 million  respectively the increase in 2014 and 2015 is due principally to research and development activities of the recently acquired wild flavors 

recent acquisitions have significantly increased the company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world that greatly enhance the company’s ability to interact with customers in europe asia and south america not only to provide flavors but also to support the sales of other food ingredients in addition the acquisition of wild flavors approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development a number of these laboratories are being expanded with new capabilities to enhance the company’s ability to develop custom solutions for our customers 

the company is working with the us department of energy’s national energy technology laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration as a viable option for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations the first project illinois basin decatur project started operations in the first quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2012 and successfully completed injecting 1 million tons of co 2  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended december 31 2014 the second project the illinois industrial carbon capture  sequestration commenced construction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2012 and was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended december 31 2015 this second facility obtained the underground injection control permit in november 2014 and is expected to receive authorization to start injection in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 



the company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of industrial chemicals with an objective to produce key chemical building blocks that serve as a platform for producing a variety of commodity chemicals the key chemical building blocks are derived from the company’s starch and oilseedbased feedstocks conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis the chemicals pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as newtothemarket biobased products the company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration in an effort to further advance the development of biobased chemical technologies the company has partnered with the center for environmentally beneficial catalysis and has added research capabilities at the university of kansas 

environmental compliance 

during the year ended december 31 2015  61 million was spent specifically to improve equipment facilities and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies 

there have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment 

the company’s business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has adopted regulations requiring the owners and operators of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions the us epa has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources under the clean air act for example the us epa has promulgated rules regarding the construction and operation of boilers which could indirectly affect the company by limiting the construction of new coalfired boilers and significantly increasing the complexity and cost of modifying any existing coalfired boilers california is also moving forward with various programs to reduce greenhouse gases globally a number of countries that are parties to the kyoto protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation regulations and agreements most notable is the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system the company has several facilities in europe that participate in this system it is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation regulations or agreements potential consequences could include increased energy transportation raw material and administrative costs and may require the company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment 

number of employees 

the number of fulltime employees of the company was approximately 32300 at december 31 2015  and 33900 at december 31 2014  the net decrease in the number of fulltime employees is primarily related to the sale of the company’s cocoa and chocolate businesses partially offset by acquisitions

risk factors 

tableend

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance 

management directs a companywide integrated risk management irm program with oversight from the company’s board of directors the company’s audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis 

the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the irm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits 

the company through its business unit functional and corporate teams are continually updating assessing monitoring and mitigating these and other business and compliance risks through the irm program 

the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the company’s control and could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops additionally the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the company in its operations is maintained these factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and consequently in the company’s operating results and working capital requirements reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weatherrelated factors or other reasons could adversely affect the company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the company’s ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner for example a drought in north america in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased high and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cyles price volatility is somewhat diminished this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities 



the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities workforce and other materials and supplies additionally competitors offer similar products and services as well as alternative products and services to the company’s customers the company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins profits and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating working capital dividend or capital expenditure needs competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring online idled capacity or to build new production capacity many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities the markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the us dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than us products thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the company’s significant origination processing and export footprint and the company’s operating results in addition continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the company to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market share maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions 

fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers a significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas while 54 percent of the company’s processing plants and 70 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the united states the company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as western europe canada brazil and emerging market areas such as eastern europe asia portions of south and central america the middle east and africa one of the company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as asia eastern europe the middle east and africa both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the company’s products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the company’s suppliers customers and other counterparties in addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges limitations or regulations affecting trade flows such as concerning genetically modified organisms local currency concerns and other economic and political instability political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees etc economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company’s operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies thus reducing the company’s overall market value 



government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses and political instability could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates and regulations governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry such as taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products including policies related to genetically modified organisms product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the company’s products and industry profitability for example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states can have an impact on the company’s operating results international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions regulations of financial markets and instruments including the doddfrank act consumer protection act and the european market infrastructure regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the company’s agricultural commodity risk management practices as well as the company’s futures commission merchant business future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the company’s products restrict the company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company’s operating results could be affected by changes in other governmental policies mandates and regulations including monetary fiscal and environmental policies laws regulations acquisition approvals and other activities of governments agencies and similar organizations these risks include but are not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions local labor conditions and regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases international risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the company’s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

the company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio government policies including antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations and other government regulations and mandates can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully 

the company is subject to industryspecific risks which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling socially acceptable farming practices environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims the liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the company in addition negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage the company’s reputation the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

certain of the company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed the company is subject to risks associated with economic or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry an outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed a decrease in demand for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 



the company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

the company does business globally connecting crops and markets in 165  countries the company is required to comply with the numerous and broadreaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal state and local and foreign governmental authorities the company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental and handling and production of regulated substances the company frequently faces challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company as examples the company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company covering various prior periods any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation 

the production of the company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions although the company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure compliance with laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company’s reputation business cash flows and results of operations 

in addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws may require the company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results 

the company is exposed to potential business disruption including but not limited to disruption of transportation services supply of noncommodity raw materials used in its processing operations and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war natural disasters severe weather conditions and accidents which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services a disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the company’s facilities and impair the company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner the company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively if access to these navigable waters is interrupted the company’s operating results could be adversely affected in addition if certain nonagricultural commodity raw materials such as water or certain chemicals used in the company’s processing operations are not available the company’s business could be disrupted any major lack of available water for use in certain of the company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results certain factors which may impact the availability of nonagricultural commodity raw materials are out of the company’s control including but not limited to disruptions resulting from weather economic conditions manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers shortage of materials interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions 

the assets and operations of the company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include but are not limited to acts of terrorism for example economic adulteration of the company’s products or war natural disasters and severe weather conditions accidents explosions and fires the potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 



the company’s business is capitalintensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company requires significant capital including access to credit markets from time to time to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy the company’s working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry moreover the expansion of the company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital access to credit markets and pricing of the company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access tier one commercial paper markets if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s risk management strategies may not be effective 

  

the company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices transportation costs energy prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the company monitors position limits and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks the company’s monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure if these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the company’s exposure to these fluctuations it could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

  

the company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

company overview 

this mda should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company is principally engaged in procuring transporting storing processing and merchandising agricultural commodities and products the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities connecting to markets in 165  countries the company also processes corn oilseeds and wheat into products for food animal feed chemical and energy uses the company uses its global asset network business acumen and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders principally from margins earned on these activities 

the company’s operations are organized managed and classified into four reportable business segments agricultural services corn processing oilseeds processing and wild flavors and specialty ingredients each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered the company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments as defined by the applicable accounting standard and are classified as other see note 17 of item 8 for more information about the company’s business segments 

effective january 1 2015 the company has formed a fourth reportable business segment wild flavors and specialty ingredients results of wild flavors and sci which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 are reported in this segment in addition to results of certain product lines previously reported in the agricultural services corn processing and oilseeds processing business segments prior period results of the product lines previously reported in the other reportable business segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 

the company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include 

 

the construction of the new feed plant facilities in china and minnesota and the soy protein facility in brazil and the expansion of the export facilities in argentina are expected to be completed in 2016 

the pending transactions are expected to close in 2016 subject to regulatory approvals 



as part of the evolution of the company’s strategic plan the company is currently undertaking a fresh look at the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio seeking innovative ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive longterm returns including a strategic review of its us corn dry mills and options for its brazilian sugarcane ethanol business based on the uncertain outlook of the brazilian sugarcane ethanol business at yearend   the company continues to evaluate all options but doesn’t expect to operate the plant after this year’s seasonal shutdown the financial impacts arising from these portfolio actions are described on pages 31 and 33 and in the relevant notes in item 8 

operating performance indicators 

the company’s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 

the company’s corn processing operations and wild flavors and specialty ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 82  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added manufacturing expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 



year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company’s operating results agricultural services was negatively impacted by the ample global supply of agricultural commodities which limited merchandising opportunities reduced demand for north american grain exports and moderated commodity prices throughout the year the increase in global supply was due to several large harvests which built up world grain stocks to historically high levels in addition the us dollar continued to be firm against weakening global currencies particularly those in major crop growing countries such as brazil argentina and ukraine this resulted in margin pressure and decreased north american export volumes most of the year partially offset by higher domestic grain demand transportation was also impacted by the decreased north american export volumes as well as lower global freight rates demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid while coproduct prices weakened ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol’s continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer despite strong demand ethanol margins were weak due to recordhigh levels of us industry production for most of the year leading to excess inventory overall demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong especially in north america south american oilseeds saw significantly higher volumes and margins for grain origination and exports due to the significant depreciation of the brazilian real against the us dollar lower softseed availability affected seed basis resulting in lower softseed crushing volumes and weaker margins particularly in europe biodiesel demand resulting from international biofuel standards continued to support demand for crude and refined vegetable oil although demand for biodiesel was softer throughout 2015 due to weaker economic conditions in certain countries the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities amid economic uncertainty in many emerging economies and some softening in demand customers’ interest to develop innovative healthy and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow 

net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased 04 billion to 18 billion  segment operating profit was down 16 due primarily to weaker ethanol margins and lower volumes and margins of north american grain exports corporate results in the current year include a charge of 189 million related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in addition to a credit of 2 million  from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a lifo credit of 245 million  in the prior year 

income taxes decreased from 877 million to 438 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a decreased effective tax rate the company’s effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 19 compared to 28 for 2014 due primarily to low tax rates on significant onetime gains related to portfolio actions a 70 million favorable impact of discrete items mainly the release of a 66 million valuation allowance and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings see note 13 in item 8 for more information 

analysis of statements of earnings 

processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 are as follows in metric tons 



the company generally operates its production facilities on an overall basis at or near capacity adjusting facilities individually as needed to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions record volumes of oilseeds were processed during the year increased from the prior year as a result of the strong demand environment for soybean meal processed volumes of corn were decreased in response to high ethanol industry production which outpaced demand throughout the year processed volumes of cocoa beans decreased due to the sale of the global cocoa business in october 2015 



revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 are as follows 



revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes in periods of significant changes in commodity prices the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit 

revenues decreased 17 due principally to lower sales prices 129 billion and lower sales volumes 06 billion sales prices decreased principally due to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices in particular prices of soybeans corn and wheat and 58 billion in foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the us dollar agricultural services revenues decreased 18 primarily due to lower sales prices 53 billion and lower sales volumes 13 billion corn processing revenues decreased 19 due principally to lower sales prices 19 billion and lower sales volumes 04 billion oilseeds processing revenues decreased 18 due principally to lower sales prices 55 billion and lower sales volumes 02 billion wild flavors and specialty ingredients revenues increased 76 due principally to higher sales volumes resulting from the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 12 billion partially offset by lower prices 02 billion 



cost of products sold decreased 128 billion to 637 billion  due principally to lower average commodity prices including 56 billion from foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the us dollar and lower manufacturing costs included in cost of products sold is a credit of 2 million  from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of 245 million  in the prior year manufacturing expenses decreased 291 million to 55 billion primarily due to lower fuel prices partially offset by increased employee benefit costs due to the inclusion of the full year costs for wild flavors and sci 

gross profit decreased 07 billion or 16 to 40 billion  due principally to lower ethanol margins 06 billion and foreign currency translation impacts 02 billion the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci was partially offset by lower credit from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo valuation reserves these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33 the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 103 million to 20 billion  due principally to increased expenses of 219 million related to the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci in the current year compared to threemonth results in the prior year partially offset by decreased pension expense primarily due to a 98 million onetime pension settlement in the prior year 

asset impairment exit and restructuring costs recognized in the current year of 200 million  consisted of longlived asset impairments of 129 million related to certain oilseeds processing facilities sugar ethanol facilities in brazil a facility in the corn processing segment and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of 71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement sugar ethanol facilities in brazil and other restructuring and exit costs longlived asset impairment for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015 consisted of property plant and equipment asset impairments of 70 million in the corn processing segment 49 million in the oilseeds processing segment 1 million in the wild flavors and specialty ingredients segment and 9 million in corporate asset impairment exit and restructuring costs recognized in the prior year of 105 million consisted of costs associated with the relocation of the company’s global headquarters to chicago illinois of 16 million restructuring charges related primarily to the wild flavors acquisition and to the integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest of 48 million otherthantemporary investment writedown of 6 million and fixed asset impairments of 35 million 

interest expense declined 29 million to 308 million  primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from the issuance of eurodenominated debt and the repurchase of certain of the company’s us dollardenominated outstanding debentures 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 18 million to 390 million  primarily due to higher earnings from the company’s investment in cip 

other income increased 74 million from 247 million  to 321 million  other income in the year ended december 31 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of 256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa chocolate and lactic businesses a gain of 212 million on the revaluation of the company’s previously held equity investments in north start shipping minmetal and eaststarch cv in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests and a gain of 62 million on the sale of a 50 interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc partially offset by a 189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in the current year and loss provisions of 45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil other income in the year ended december 31 2014 consisted primarily of gains of 156 million upon the company’s effective dilution in the pacificor joint venture and 126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business partially offset by losses of 102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition 



operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 are as follows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 



the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

  

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the decrease in fair value of the average position for december 31 2015  was the result of a decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position and also a decrease in prices 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 82  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland and brazil where the euro and us dollar are the functional currencies respectively to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 



the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 80 billion at december 31 2015  and 2014  the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 10 billion was offset by the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 809 million and 802 million for december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the decrease in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2015  is primarily due to the debt repurchase and increased interest rates partially offset by the issuance of new eurodenominated bonds

status of new products 

the company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products the acquisition of wild flavors expands the companys ability to serve the customers evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products the company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the company’s revenues in 2015 

source and availability of raw materials

the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly directly affects the company’s working capital requirements because the company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere principally north america and europe relative to the southern hemisphere primarily south america inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels no material part of the company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers the company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world typically advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest

the company’s business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has adopted regulations requiring the owners and operators of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions the us epa has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources under the clean air act for example the us epa has proposed rules regarding the construction and operation of boilers which could indirectly affect the company by limiting the construction of new coalfired boilers and significantly increasing the complexity and cost of modifying any existing coalfired boilers california is also moving forward with various programs to reduce greenhouse gases globally a number of countries that are parties to the kyoto protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation and regulations most notable is the european union greenhouse gas emission trading system the company has several facilities in europe that participate in this system it is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation potential consequences could include increased energy transportation and raw material costs and may require the company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment

fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline and diesel fuel a significant decrease in the price of gasoline or diesel fuel could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results

operating performance indicators 

the company’s oilseeds processing and agricultural services operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 

the company’s corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 79  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the us dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the company 

the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added and cost per metric ton the company’s operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forwardlooking information contained within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

year ended december 31 2014 compared to year ended december 31 2013 

as an agricultural commoditybased business the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company’s operating results demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong and steady demand for export of north american corn and soybeans was strong but logistical challenges during the winter months including rail delays and river freezes caused higher costs making us exports less competitive despite a large harvest in south america us grain exports continued for longer than normal in 2014 due to slow south american farmer selling us corn and wheat storage and merchandising opportunities were limited for much of the year until the 2014 record fall harvest corn sweetener demand was steady strong us ethanol demand from both domestic and export markets combined with industry logistical and production challenges in the winter months led to volatile but strong overall 2014 ethanol margins south american grain and oilseed origination volumes and margins were challenged by the slow farmer selling cocoa press margins have continued to improve from last year when margins were negatively impacted by excess capacity 



net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 09 billion to 22 billion segment operating profit was 39 billion  up 45 due primarily to improved corn processing and grain merchandising and handling results included in this years segment operating profit was a gain of approximately 156 million upon the companys effective dilution in the pacificor formerly kalama export company joint venture resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units a gain of 126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business longlived asset impairment charges of 35 million and wild flavors restructuring charges and acquisition costs of 33 million in 2013 segment operating profit included a 155 million writedown related to the companys graincorp investment a 51 million impairment of certain longlived assets at its brazilian sugar mill and approximately 27 million of other longlived asset impairment charges principally in the corn processing segment excluding these unique items segment operating profit improved approximately 26 in 2014 corporate costs of 785 million  in 2014 were higher by 101 million  included in 2014 costs were losses of 102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated wild flavors acquisition and 98 million of noncash pension settlement charges the prior year period included 54 million of charges related to an anticorruption settlement losses of 40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition 21 million costs related to strategic projects and costs of 32 million primarily related to asset writedowns and allocations of costs between corporate and the operating segments in 2014 lifo inventory reserves declined resulting in pretax lifo credits to earnings of 245 million  compared to lifo credits of 225 million  in 2013 excluding lifo and these other items corporate costs increased 68 million which is primarily due to higher enterprise resource planning project it and other projectrelated costs partially offsetting the increase was lower interest expense due principally to lower outstanding longterm debt balances 

the companys effective tax rate for 2014 was 280 compared to 331 for 2013 the 2014 rate was positively impacted by 47 million of positive discrete tax adjustments and a slight favorable shift in the geographic mix of earnings the 2013 rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets partially offset by favorable discrete income tax benefits related to amounts received from the us government in the form of biodiesel credits excluding these factors the effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 30

under the program and second program collectively the “programs” adm receivables and adm ireland receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the purchasers and second purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the company and the adm subsidiaries originating the receivables 

the company accounts for these transfers as sales the company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration at december 31 2014  and 2013  the company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility based on its assessment of the servicing fee market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the purchasers and second purchasers under the programs and derecognized from the company’s consolidated balance sheet was 21 billion  and 19 billion  respectively in exchange for the transfer as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the company received cash of 16 billion  and 11 billion  respectively and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets of 05 billion  and 08 billion  respectively cash collections from customers on receivables sold were 364 billion  398 billion  219 billion  and 89 billion  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  the six months ended december 31 2012 and the year ended june 30 2012 respectively of this amount 351 billion  398 billion  219 billion  and 89 billion  pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the six months ended december 31 2012 and the year ended june 30 2012 respectively deferred consideration is paid to the company in cash on behalf of the purchasers and second purchasers as receivables are collected however as these are revolving facilities cash collected from the company’s customers is reinvested by the purchasers and second purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the programs 

  

the company’s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the program is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding the company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs a level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant 

transfers of receivables under the program during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  the six months ended december 31 2012 and the year ended june 30 2012 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of 5 million  4 million  4 million  and 4 million  respectively which is classified as selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 



the company reflects all cash flows related to the program as operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows because the cash received from the purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the shortterm nature of the company’s trade receivables

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 

commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 

the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

  

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the decrease in fair value of the average position for december 31 2014  was the result of the decrease in commodity prices and the decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position 



currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 79  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland and brazil where the euro and us dollar are the functional currencies respectively to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 

the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 80 billion at december 31 2014  and 78 billion at december 31 2013  this increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar of 09 billion the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 802 million and 779 million for december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the increase in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2014  is primarily due to decreased interest rates

the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates 

the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities workforce and other materials and supplies additionally competitors offer similar products and services as well as alternative products and services to the company’s customers the company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins profits and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating working capital dividend or capital expenditure needs competition impacts the company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors pricing of the company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring online idled capacity or to build new production capacity many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities the markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution to compete effectively the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market share and providing high levels of customer service competition could increase the company’s costs to purchase raw materials lower selling prices of its products or reduce the company’s market share which may result in lower and more inefficient operating rates and reduced gross profit 



fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices the company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal the company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the company’s production costs and operating results 

the company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline and diesel fuel a significant decrease in the price of gasoline or diesel fuel could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results

the company’s oilseeds processing and agricultural services operations are principally agricultural commoditybased businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commoditybased agricultural raw materials therefore changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit 

the company’s corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials however in these operations agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold thus changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 74  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods for the majority of the company’s business activities in brazil the functional currency is the us dollar however certain transactions including taxes occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real as compared to the us dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the us dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the company 



the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings segment operating profit return on invested capital ebitda economic value added and cost per metric ton the company’s operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices weather conditions crop plantings government programs and policies changes in global demand general global economic conditions change s in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops due to these unpredictable factors the company does not provide forwardlooking information in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

agricultural services operating profits decreased 376 million to 947 million merchandising and handling earnings decreased primarily due to lower results from us operations lower sales volumes were principally the result of the relatively higher cost of us grains and oilseeds in the global market due to lower stocks caused by a smaller us harvest in 2011 this relatively weaker position led to reduced us grain exports in the prior year merchandising and handling results were positively impacted by higher quantities of us grain exports by the company in addition fiscal 2012 included 40 million of increased loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award earnings from transportation were steady prior year’s operating results in milling and other operations included a 78 million gain related to gruma’s disposal of certain assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the market risk inherent in the company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company’s net commodity position foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below 



commodities 

the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in customer preferences and standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops 

the company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for and produced in its business operations by entering into derivative and nonderivative contracts which reduce the company’s overall short or long commodity position additionally the company uses exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchangetraded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities counterparty contract defaults and volatility of freight markets in addition the company from timetotime enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in a future month the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been and are expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 

the company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories related purchase and sales contracts energy and freight contracts and exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded and overthecounter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements net of sales 

  

the fair value of the company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy the company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure which consist of volumetric limits and valueatrisk var limits var measures the potential loss at a 95 confidence level that could be incurred over a one year period volumetric limits are monitored daily and var calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly 

in addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices assuming no correlations over a one year period using var sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices the highest lowest and average weekly position for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows 



the decrease in fair value of the average position for december 31 2013  was the result of the decrease in commodity prices and the decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position 

currencies 

the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 74  countries for the majority of the company’s subsidiaries located outside the united states the local currency is the functional currency to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in euro british pound canadian dollar and brazilian real currencies these currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur the company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts swaps with banks exchangetraded futures contracts and overthecounter options the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 



the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the yearend exchange rates is 75 billion at december 31 2013  and 77 billion at december 31 2012 this decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar partially offset by the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates the potential loss in fair value which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is 751 million and 773 million for december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively actual results may differ 

interest 

the fair value of the company’s longterm debt is estimated using quoted market prices where available and discounted future cash flows based on the company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements such fair value exceeded the longterm debt carrying value market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates actual results may differ 



the decrease in fair value of longterm debt at december 31 2013  is due to increased current maturities repayments and interest rates
