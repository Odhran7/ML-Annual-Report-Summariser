recent developments 

  

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent developments” herein for a discussion related to the covid19 pandemic and recent corporate transactions 

  

industry 

  

the global health care distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to midsized and large group practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several hundred practices owned or operated by dental support organizations dsos medical group purchasing organizations gpos hospital systems or integrated delivery networks idns 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner hygienist or office manager supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due to demand driven by the aging population increased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care an increasing understanding of the connection between good oral health and overall health improved access to care globally the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological improvements including the advancement of software and services prosthetic solutions and telemedicine in addition the nonacute market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

  

in addition customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations under common management and the movement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician or alternate care setting as the health care industry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of health maintenance organizations “hmos” group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

  

competition 

  

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors in certain parts of the dental end market such as those related to dental specialty products and medical end market manufacturers already sell directly to end customers 

  

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line ecommerce capabilities customer service and 

  

valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors in the us are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the us medical market which accounts for the large majority of our global medical sales are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete with a number of regional and local medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians with regard to our dental software we compete against numerous companies including the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc carestream health inc open dental software inc planetdds llc good methods global inc dba carestack and curve dental llc in other software end markets including revenue cycle management patient relationship management and patient demand generation we compete with companies such as vyne therapeutics inc edihealth group inc dba dental x change inc weave communications inc solutionreach inc zocdoc inc localmed inc and prosites inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems  inc eclinicalworks allscripts healthcare solutions inc and epic systems corporation

markets served 

  

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services according to the us census bureau’s international database between 2021 and 2031 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 11 between 2021 and 2041 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 22 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 7 between 2021 and 2031 and approximately 12 between 2021 and 2041 

  

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45andolder segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

  

in the medical market there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices and home health settings a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

  

  

we support our dental and medical professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

  

additionally we seek to expand our dental fullservice model and medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist we do this through both direct sales and by partnering with local distribution companies 

  

for information on revenues and longlived assets by geographic area see note 3 – segment and geographic data of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations sales and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners for certain products including equipment and software and yearend promotions sales and profitability may also be impacted by the timing of certain annual and biennial dental tradeshows where equipment promotions are offered in addition some dental practices delay equipment purchases in the us until yearend due to tax incentives we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future 

  

governmental regulations 

  

we strive to be compliant with the applicable laws regulations and guidance described below and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial compliance however compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future as certain laws regulations and guidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply as well as future changes additions and enforcement approaches including political changes president biden’s administration the “biden administration” has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuit of alleged violations of law and it has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency guidance to pursue potential violations as well as that it was more prepared to pursue individuals for corporate law violations including an aggressive approach to anticorruption activities changes to applicable laws regulations and guidance described below as well as related administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to update or revise our operations services marketing practices and compliance programs and controls and may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us pose new or previously immaterial risks to us or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

government 

  

certain of our businesses involve the distribution importation exportation marketing and sale of and third party payment for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations including as applicable to our wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and as part of our specialty home medical supply business that distributes and sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients the federal government and state governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care sector particularly in areas of fraud and abuse antibribery and corruption controlled substances handling medical device regulations and data privacy and security standards 

  

government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there have been efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs including efforts thus far unsuccessful to seek repeal of the entire united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 as amended the “aca” in addition activities to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services are ongoing many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our financial performance 

  

  

our businesses are also generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust consumer protection antibribery and antikickback customer interaction transparency data privacy data security government contracting price gouging and other laws and regulations 

  

failure to comply with laws rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

operating security and licensure standards 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to local state and federal governmental laws and regulations relating to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and supplies among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act as well as laws regulating the billing of and reimbursement from government programs such as medicare and medicaid and from commercial payers we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

  

the fdc act the controlled substances act their implementing regulations and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising marketing and promotion sampling pricing and reimbursement labeling packaging storage handling returning or recalling reporting and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state furthermore section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products” 

  

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system by november 27 2023 that will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt certain state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

  

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and thirdparty logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa in addition with respect to our specialty home medical supply business we are subject to certain state licensure laws including state pharmacy laws and also certain accreditation standards including to qualify for reimbursement from medicare and other thirdparty payers 

  

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the udi rule phased in the implementation of the udi regulations generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018 with a final set of requirements for low risk devices being reached on september 24 2022 which will complete the phase in however in may 2021 the fda issued an enforcement policy stating that it does not intend to object to the use of legacy identification 

  

numbers on device labels and packages for finished devices manufactured and labeled prior to september 24 2023 the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices including but not limited to certain software that qualifies as a medical device under fda rules and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations and subsequent fda guidance regarding the udi requirements provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses 

  

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling reporting recordkeeping and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment 

  

in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers 

  

eu regulation of medicinal and dental products 

  

european union “eu” member states regulate their own healthcare systems as does eu law the latter regulates certain matters most notably medicinal products and medical devices medicinal products are defined broadly as substances or combinations of substances having certain functionalities and may not include medical devices eu “regulations” apply in all member states whereas “directives” are implemented by the individual laws of member states 

  

on medicines for humans we are regulated under directive no 200183ec of 6 november 2001 as amended by directive 200363ec of 25 june 2003 and eu regulation ec no 7262004 of 31 march 2004 these rules provide for the authorization of products and regulate their manufacture importation marketing and distribution it implements requirements which may be implemented without warning as well as a national pharmacovigilance system under which marketing authorizations may be withdrawn and includes potential sanctions for breaches of the rules and on other bases such as harmfulness or inefficiency 

  

eu regulation no 12232009 of 30 november 2009 on cosmetic products requires that cosmetic products which includes dental products be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer importer and distributor it includes market surveillance and noncompliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of products along with other sanctions 

  

  

in the eu the eu medical device regulation no 2017745 of 5 april 2017 “eu mdr” covers a wide scope of our activities from dental material to xray machines and certain software it was meant to become applicable three years after publication ie may 26 2020 however on april 23 2020 to allow european economic area “eea” national authorities notified bodies manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the covid19 pandemic the european council and parliament adopted regulation 2020561 postponing the date of application of the eu mdr by one year to may 26 2021 

  

the eu mdr significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole among other things the eu mdr 

  

• s trengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available 

• e stablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• i mproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through a unique identification number 

• s ets up a central database to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu 

• s trengthens rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices such as implants which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market and 

• identifies importers and distributors and medical device products through registration in a database eudamed not due until may 26 2022 and after 

  

in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance medical devices that have been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier however requirements regarding the distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

  

other eu regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances include eu regulation no 19072006 of 18 december 2006 concerning the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals  which requires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import in the eu beyond certain quantities and the eu regulation no 12722008 of 16 december 2008 on classification labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures which sets various obligations with respect to the labelling and packaging of concerned substances and mixtures 

  

furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to delay product release sale or distribution or institute voluntary recalls of or other corrective action with respect to products we sell each of which could result in regulatory and enforcement actions financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation which may affect our interactions with customers including the design and functionality of our products 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions in addition certain of our businesses must operate in compliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and recordkeeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for payment under federal state and commercial healthcare reimbursement programs one of these businesses was recently suspended by cms from receiving payments from medicare although it is permitted to continue to perform and bill for medicare services the amounts billed are being deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of an audit the company has not recognized revenue for these services and has currently deferred slightly over 4 million in revenue 

  

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

  

  

antitrust and consumer protection 

  

the federal government of the united states most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive as well as consumer protection laws that seek to protect consumers from improper business practices at the us federal level the federal trade commission oversees enforcement of these types of laws and states have similar government agencies violations of antitrust or consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages eu law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules protecting consumers the biden administration has indicated increased antitrust enforcement and has been more aggressive in enforcement activities 

  

health care fraud 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs certain additional state and federal laws such as the federal physician selfreferral law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibit physicians and other health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician or family member has a financial relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services for example durable medical equipment and medical supplies unless an exception applies violations of antikickback statutes or the stark law may be enforced as violations of the federal false claims act 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under applicable false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under the federal false claims act as well as potential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs criminal penalties or imposition of a corporate compliance monitor which could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties as well as other fraud and abuse laws 

  

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

  

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or failure to comply with applicable law could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

affordable care act and other insurance reform 

  

the aca increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage the aca also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance 

  

the aca has faced frequent legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate and congressional action seeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in 2012 the united states supreme court in upholding the constitutionality of the aca and its individual mandate provision requiring that people buy health insurance or else face a penalty simultaneously limited aca provisions requiring medicaid expansion making such expansion a statebystate decision in addition one of the major political parties in the united states remains committed to seeking the aca’s legislative repeal but legislative efforts to do so have previously failed to pass both chambers of congress under president trump’s administration a number of administrative actions were taken to materially weaken the aca including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the aca the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions also effectively repealed the aca’s individual mandate by zeroing out the penalty for noncompliance in the most recent aca litigation the federal fifth circuit court of appeals found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and returned the case to the district court for the northern district of texas for consideration of whether the remainder of the aca could survive the excision of the individual mandate the fifth circuit’s decision was appealed to the united states supreme court the supreme court issued a decision on june 17 2021 without reaching the merits of the case the supreme court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the aca any outcomes of future cases that change the aca in addition to future legislation regulation guidance andor executive orders that do the same could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry for instance the american rescue plan act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the aca these changes are timelimited with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022 

  

an aca provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program the “sunshine act” imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists teaching hospitals physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by covered recipients in the reporting entity the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist teaching hospital and nonphysician practitioner identities the sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be unclear we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers 

  

in the united states government actions to seek to increase healthrelated price transparency may also affect our business 

  

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework which modified certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models through which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities data collected in the first mips performance year 2017 determined payment adjustments that began january 1 2019 macra standards and payment levels continue to 

  

evolve and reflect a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace new statelevel payment and delivery system reform programs including those modeled after such federal programs are also increasingly being rolled out through medicaid administrators as well as through the private sector which may further alter the marketplace and impact our business 

  

recently in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president executive branch agencies and various states at the state level several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs at the federal level several related bills have been introduced and regulations proposed which if enacted or finalized respectively would impact drug pricing and related costs 

  

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

eu directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products 

  

eu law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are implemented by eu member states directive no 89105ec of 21 december 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems  member states may subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon objective and verifiable criteria regulate the price charged or its increases for authorized medicines and their level of reimbursement or they may freeze prices place controls on the profitability of persons responsible for placing medicinal products on the market and include or exclude the medicine on the list of products covered by national health insurance systems 

  

eu law does not expressly include provisions like those of the sunshine act in the united states but a growing number of eu member states such as france since 2011 have enacted laws to increase the transparency of relationships in the healthcare sector the scope of these laws varies from one member state to another and may for example include the relations between healthcare industry players and physicians or their associations students preparing for medical professions or their associations teachers health establishments or publishers of prescription and dispensing assistance software 

  

regulated software electronic health records 

  

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings the 21st century cures act the “cures act” signed into law on december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from fda regulation including clinical decision support software that meets certain criteria on september 27 2019 the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which incorporated applicable cures act standards including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the fda as medical devices and continues to issue new guidance in this area certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

  

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products and our specialty home medical supply business include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be 

  

vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 section 5 of the federal trade commission act the california privacy act “ccpa” and the california privacy rights act “cpra” that becomes effective on january 1 2023 laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations these requirements may not be harmonized may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices our businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products to reflect these legal requirements which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  

also the european parliament and the council of the eu adopted the paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in the eu or eea “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers and employees the gdpr extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues and data subjects may seek damages member states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the storage use or other processing of the personal data the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating notably to information access modification erasure and transporting of the personal data 

  

on august 20 2021 china promulgated the prc personal information protection law “pipl” which took effect on november 1 2021 the pipl imposes specific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies that the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried out outside china but for the purpose of providing products or services to prc citizens any noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities other penalties as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us which may affect our business financial condition or results of operations the pipl carries maximum penalties of cny50 million or 5 of the annual revenue of entities that process personal data 

  

in the united states the ccpa which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information of california residents compliance with the new obligations imposed by the ccpa depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them regulations were released in august of 2020 but there remains some uncertainty about how the ccpa will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators if we fail to comply with the ccpa or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the ccpa we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation any of which may negatively impact our reputation require us to expend significant resources and harm our business furthermore california voters approved the cpra on november 3 2020 which will amend and expand the ccpa including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information and creating a new state agency to enforce the ccpa and the cpra the cpra will come into effect on january 1 2023 applying to information collected by businesses on or after january 1 2022 

  

other states as well as the federal government have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance virginia and colorado were both successful in passing privacy legislation in 2021 becoming effective on january 1 2023 and july 1 2023 

  

respectively while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr ccpa pipl and cpra requirements our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records and our products may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

  

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists through mips to use ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in evolving standards adopted by cms and the office of the national coordinator for health information technology of hhs “onc” certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of such certified ehr systems and other products linked to government supported incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we may be exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act 

  

moreover in order to satisfy our customers and comply with evolving legal requirements our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex functionality such as with respect to reporting and information blocking although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers failure to abide by these and other electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

  

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

  

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care 

  

ecommerce 

  

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

international transactions 

  

united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that laws and regulations that impact our business or laws and regulations as they apply to our customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations so you should not consider the risks disclosed in this section to necessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the company believes that the following risks could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial results financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock the order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect their relative importance or priority 

  

company risks 

  

our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the effects of disease outbreaks epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns and other natural disasters  the covid19 pandemic and the responses of governments to it had and may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 

  

our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the 

effects of disease outbreaks epidemics pandemics similar widespread public health concerns and other natural disasters the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have an unprecedented impact on society worldwide economic activity and the health care sector particularly the dental market as a global healthcare solutions company the covid19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had and may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity even after the covid19 pandemic has begun to subside we may again experience material adverse impacts to our business results of operations and cash flows as a result of among other things its global economic impact including any recession that may occur in the future or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the reluctance of patients to return for elective dental or medical care the impacts and potential impacts from the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to 

• significant volatility in supply demand and selling prices for personal protective equipment ppe covid19 tests and other covid19 related products available supply customer demand and selling prices for ppe covid19 tests and other covid19 related products fluctuated in fiscal 2021 and we expect such volatility to continue for the duration of the covid19 pandemic this has resulted in inventory reserves fluctuating margins and increased revenue related to such products although we have experienced significant growth in sales volumes for ppe covid19 tests and other covid19 related products during the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that such growth in sales volumes will be maintained during or following the covid19 pandemic our estimates for supply demand and selling prices are inherently uncertain and if supply demand selling prices or other market dynamics significantly fluctuate in the future beyond our current assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required margins may be reduced andor revenue may decline for such products each which could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows additionally governmental policies designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 and variants thereof could once again lead to the closure of dental offices or deferral of elective procedures and wellness exams by medical and dental patients such previous closures and restrictions impacted our customers’ spending with us and had and if reinstated may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows although we believe that most practices currently are able to access adequate supply we still may be unable to supply our customers with the specific brand andor quantity of certain ppe products covid19 tests and other covid19 related products they demand which may lead to our customers seeking alternative sources of supply healthcare professionals’ inability to obtain a sufficient quantity andor brand of certain ppe covid19 tests and other covid19 related products would adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

  

• reduction in peoples’ ability and willingness to be in public restrictions recommended by several public health organizations and implemented from time to time by federal state and local governments to slow and limit the transmission of covid19 and variants thereof has caused and may in the future cause some people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental appointments which could again materially adversely affect demand for our products a lengthened period of materially suppressed demand could again cause material adverse impacts on our business results of operations and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

• potential delays in customer payments or defaults on our customer credit arrangements we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flows or operating and financial performance deteriorate due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose more stringent payment terms the inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms may materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity and may limit the amounts we can borrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization 

• impact on third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us impact on our ability to meet obligations to third parties failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors including thirdparty shippers joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties travel restrictions and border closures andor other domestic and global supply chain disruptions may materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity certain of our contracts with supply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions if we satisfy certain sales or purchasing targets that in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other cases we may not be able to fully satisfy due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate more favorable terms could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

• negative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices the spread of covid19 and variants thereof caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or our customers or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees as the covid19 pandemic continues to unfold we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions for our business many of our employees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our officebased workers who are able to work from home continue to do so an extended period of modified business practices and remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on employee morale strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to efficiently operate our business 

• significant changes in political conditions significant changes in political conditions in markets in which we purchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to continue at least during the pendency of the pandemic including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise constrain the operations of our business partners suppliers or customers which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

• potential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities an extended negative impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity could impact our ability to meet our obligations under credit facilities or outstanding long term debt which contain maximum leverage ratios and customary representations warranties and affirmative covenants 

• volatility in the financial markets volatility in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

• refocusing management resources to mitigate effects of the covid19 pandemic  our management is focused on 

  

mitigating the effects of the covid19 pandemic which has required and may continue to require for the duration of the pandemic a large investment of time and resources across the company and may delay certain strategic and other plans which could materially adversely affect our business 

• potential   increased costs associated with our selfinsured medical insurance programs we may incur significant employee health care costs under our selfinsurance medical insurance programs if a large number of our employees andor their covered family members become ill from covid19 and variants thereof 

  

• vaccination or testing mandates the imposition of government or customer mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees attract new employees and retain certain product and service contracts it is possible that a significant number of our employees have not been vaccinated and in the event of a vaccine mandate some of those employees may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination the imposition of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily such labor shortages could also affect our ability to retain certain specific contracts to which the mandates may apply reduce our sales andor affect our ability to fulfill customer orders impacting our revenue and profitability furthermore managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt andor unvaccinated employees could potentially increase our costs as could addressing inconsistent mandates covid19 vaccine mandates and similar regulations have the potential to materially adversely affect our business as the scope nature and effect of such mandates are uncertain at this time and 

• reputational risk associated with response to the covid19 pandemic if we do not respond appropriately to the covid19 pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands which could materially adversely affect our business 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

  

we obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties with whom we generally do not have longterm contracts while there is typically more than one source of supply some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell in 2021 our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30 and 4 respectively of our aggregate purchases because of our dependence upon such suppliers our operations are subject to the suppliers’ ability and willingness to supply products in the quantities that we require and the risks include delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including a supplier’s failure to comply with applicable government requirements which may result in product recalls andor cessation of sales or an interruption in the suppliers’ manufacturing capabilities in the event of any such interruption in supply we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all and an extended interruption in supply particularly of a high sales volume product could result in a significant disruption in our sales and operations as well as damage to our relationships with customers and our reputation in addition certain of our suppliers have had their ability to service certain markets restricted or negatively impacted because of allegations of forced labor in their supply chain forced labor legislation affecting the supply chain has increased around the world and the united states recently passed the uyghur forced labor prevention act our supply chain could be materially disrupted if our suppliers fail to comply with or are unable to satisfy our demand for products as a result of applicable forced labor legislation and regulations 

  

our future growth especially for our technology and valueadded services segment is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

  

our future success depends on our ability to timely develop or obtain the right to sell competitive and innovative particularly for our technology and valueadded services segment products and services and to market them 

  

quickly and costeffectively our ability to anticipate customer needs and emerging trends and develop or acquire new products services and technologies at competitive prices requires significant resources including employees with the requisite skills experience and expertise particularly in our technology segment including dental practice management patient engagement and demand creation software solutions the failure to successfully address these challenges could materially disrupt our sales and operations additionally our software and eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with customers as well as our reputation with respect to certain software and eservices that we develop we rely primarily upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections and confidentiality obligations we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect our software or eservices products 

  

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks and may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

  

one of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions require significant management attention may place significant demands on our operations information systems and financial resources and there is risk that one or more may not succeed we cannot be sure for example that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional costs or expenses our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends upon among other things the following 

  

• the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices 

• our ability to consummate such transactions which could potentially be prohibited due to us or foreign antitrust regulations 

• the liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on acceptable terms 

• our ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures 

• our ability to retain recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire and 

• our ability to successfully integrate these companies’ operations services products and personnel with our culture management policies internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls and strategies 

  

furthermore some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give rise to an obligation to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have material adverse impacts on our financial results individually or in the aggregate 

  

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

  

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things require i the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60 of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger consolidation or a sale lease transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets and ii the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 23 of our common stock entitled to vote to a remove a director and b to amend or repeal our bylaws with certain limited exceptions in addition certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated vesting of stock options and other awards upon termination without cause within two years following a change in control or grant the plan committee discretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years following a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control 

  

  

industry risks 

  

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive including without limitation competition from thirdparty online commerce sites and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

  

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role in distribution industry consolidation among health care product distributors and manufacturers price competition product unavailability whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in manufacturing supply or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition consolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained in some of our contracts additionally traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the affordable care act could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the united states and has been the target of litigation and congressional reform efforts since its adoption the us supreme court in upholding the constitutionality of the aca and its individual mandate provision in 2012 simultaneously limited aca provisions requiring medicaid expansion making such expansion a statebystate decision in 2017 the us congress effectively repealed the aca’s individual mandate provision by eliminating the financial penalty for noncompliance in the most recent aca litigation a federal appeals court found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and returned the case to a lower federal court for consideration of whether the remainder of the aca could survive the excision of the individual mandate this decision was appealed to the us supreme court and the supreme court issued a decision on june 17 2021 without reaching the merits of the case the supreme court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the aca any outcome of future cases that change the aca in addition to future legislation regulation guidance andor executive orders that do the same could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry for instance the american rescue plan act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the aca these changes are timelimited with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022 

  

the health care industry is experiencing changes due to political economic and regulatory influences that could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other factors trends toward managed care collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers including increased attention to valuebased payment arrangements as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical supplies and devices andor medical treatments or services or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” dental support organizations “dso” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

  

the health care products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for health care products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos and dsos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks gpos and dsos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete effectively which could in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to access lower prices demanded by gpo and dso contracts or other contracts and to develop relationships with existing and emerging provider networks gpos and dsos we cannot guarantee that such terms will be obtained or contracts executed 

  

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

  

our ability to meet our customers’ expedited delivery expectations is an integral component of our business strategy for which our customers rely shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers including at transportation centers or shipping ports could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

  

macro economic and political risks 

  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things 

  

• election results 

• changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade including without limitation the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca the euuk trade and cooperation agreement of december 2020 and other international trade agreements 

• greater restrictions on imports and exports 

• supply chain disruptions 

• changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy 

• tariffs and sanctions 

• changes to the relationship between the united states and china 

• sovereign debt levels 

• the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues 

• consumer confidence 

• unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population 

• changes in regulatory and tax regulations 

• interest rate fluctuations 

• availability of capital 

• increases in fuel and energy costs 

• the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time and pass through to our customers price increases we may receive 

• changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions 

• increases in health care costs 

  

• the threat or outbreak of war terrorism or public unrest including without limitation the possibility of war in the ukraine and a wider european or global conflict and 

• changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing development and investment in territories and countries where we do business 

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall recessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms 

  

regulatory and litigation risks 

  

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business 

  

we strive to be compliant with the applicable laws regulations and guidance described below and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial compliance however compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future as certain laws regulations and guidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply as well as future changes additions and enforcement approaches including in light of political changes the biden administration has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuing alleged violations of law and it has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency guidance to pursue such violations as well as indicating it was more prepared to pursue individuals for corporate law violations including an aggressive approach to anticorruption activities changes with respect to the applicable laws regulations and guidance described below may require us to update or revise our operations services marketing practices and compliance programs and controls and may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us pose new or previously immaterial risks to us or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities the form content or timing of regulatory actions and their impact on the health care industry and on our business and operations 

  

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing in the united states in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president executive branch agencies and various states at the state level several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs at the federal level several related bills have been introduced and regulations proposed which if enacted or finalized respectively would impact drug pricing and related costs 

  

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients including physicians dentists teaching hospitals and certain other nonphysician practitioners we or our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be unclear we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements such compliance imposes additional costs on us and the requirements are sometimes unclear in the united states government actions to seek to increase healthrelated price transparency may also affect our business 

  

  

our business is subject to additional requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the sale and distribution of and thirdparty payment for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and hctp products among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the fdc act the federal drug quality and security act including dscsa and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

  

• regulate the introduction manufacture advertising marketing and promotion sampling pricing and reimbursement labeling packaging storage handling returning or recalling reporting and distribution of and record keeping for drugs hctp products and medical devices including requirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers 

• subject us to inspection by the fda and dea and similar state authorities 

• regulate the storage transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials 

• require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable fda requirements 

• require registration with the fda and the dea and various state agencies 

• require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products 

• require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the dea 

• require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities 

• impose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical hctp product or medical device causes serious illness injury or death 

• require manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers of prescription drugs to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed 

• require the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and thirdparty logistics providers and 

• mandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs and associated reporting requirements 

  

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings the cures act signed into law on december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from fda regulation including certain clinical decision support software on september 27 2019 the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which incorporated applicable cures act standards including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the fda as medical devices and continues to issue new guidance in this area certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is subject to regulation as a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements costs and potential enforcement actions or liabilities for noncompliance with respect to these products 

  

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration program eligibility procurement thirdparty reimbursement sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to product manufacturers product labeling personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products the fda and dea as well as cms including with respect to complex medicare reimbursement requirements applicable to our specialty home medical supplies business have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities and in particular the dea has heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the united states one of our businesses was recently suspended by cms from receiving payments from medicare although it is permitted to continue to perform and bill for medicare services the amounts billed are being deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of an audit the company has not recognized revenue for these services and has currently deferred slightly over 4 million in revenue our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 

  

  

the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters substantial civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability to participate in important federal and state government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid and damage our reputation 

  

the eu medical device regulation may adversely affect our business 

  

the eu mdr applicable since may 26 2021 significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole among other things the eu mdr 

  

• strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available 

• establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through a unique identification number 

• sets up a central database to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu 

• strengthens rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices such as implants which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market and 

• identifies importers and distributors and medical device products through registration in a database eudamed not due until may 26 2022 and after 

  

in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance medical devices that have been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier however requirements regarding the distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

  

the modifications created by the eu mdr may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the european economic area 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs certain additional state and federal laws such 

  

as the federal physician selfreferral law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibit physicians and other health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician or family member has a financial relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services for example durable medical equipment and medical supplies unless an exception applies violations of antikickback statutes or the stark law may be enforced as violations of the federal false claims act 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under applicable false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under the federal false claims act as well as potential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs criminal penalties or imposition of a corporate compliance monitor which could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties as well as other fraud and abuse laws 

  

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians dentists and other health care providers on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

  

in the eu the directive no 20191937 of 23 october 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of union law which was to be implemented by eu member states by december 17 2021 organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers this directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches of certain eu laws in particular as regards public health the abovementioned directive no 200183 regulation no 7262004 or as regards data protection the gdpr the directive protects a wide range of people and includes former employees all private companies with 50 or more employees are required to create effective internal reporting channels the implementation of this directive by eu member states is still underway for many of them as of midjanuary 2022 only five eu member states have fully implemented it denmark lithuania malta portugal and sweden while the process is ongoing in the others but with varying degrees of progress 

  

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation securities antitrust consumer protection and marketing laws and regulations 

  

in the eu both active and passive bribery are criminalized the eu council framework decision 2003568jha of 22 july 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector establishes more detailed rules on the liability of legal persons and deterrent sanctions however the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national level 

  

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters intentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our 

  

services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection storage and processing of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities 

  

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products and our specialty home medical supply business include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies 

  

we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information such as hipaa the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 section 5 of the federal trade commission act the ccpa and the cpra that becomes effective on january 1 2023 laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations these requirements may not be harmonized may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices our businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products to reflect these legal requirements which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  

in addition the european parliament and the council of the eu have adopted the gdpr which increases privacy rights for individuals in the eu or eea or “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers and employees the gdpr extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues data subjects also have the right to seek compensation for damages member states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the storage use or other processing of the personal data the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating notably to information access modification erasure and transporting of the personal data 

  

on august 20 2021 china promulgated the pipl which took effect on november 1 2021 the pipl imposes specific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies that the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried out outside china but for the purpose of providing products or services to prc citizens any noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities other penalties as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us which may affect our business financial condition or results of operations the pipl carries maximum penalties of cny50 million or 5 of the annual revenue of entities that process personal data 

  

in the united states the ccpa which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information of california residents compliance with the obligations imposed by the ccpa depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them regulations were released in august of 2020 but there remains some uncertainty about how the ccpa will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators if we fail to comply with the ccpa or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the ccpa we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation 

  

any of which may negatively impact our reputation require us to expend significant resources and harm our business furthermore california voters approved the cpra on november 3 2020 which will amend and expand the ccpa including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information and creating a new state agency to enforce ccpa and cpra the cpra will come into effect on january 1 2023 applying to information collected by businesses on or after january 1 2022 

  

other states as well as the federal government have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance virginia and colorado were both successful in passing privacy legislation in 2021 becoming effective on january 1 2023 and july 1 2023 respectively while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr ccpa pipl and cpra requirements our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records our products or services may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws and contractual requirements perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

  

under the gdpr health data belong to the category of “sensitive data” and benefit from specific protections processing of such data is generally prohibited except for specific exceptions 

  

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of ehr systems and other products linked to government supported incentive programs where the ehr systems must be certified as having certain capabilities designated in evolving standards such as those adopted by cms and onc in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy the changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we may be exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or resulting changes in our could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

moreover in order to satisfy our customers and comply with evolving legal requirements our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex functionality such as with respect to reporting and information blocking although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

  

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially 

  

adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

  

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

  

our business involves a risk of product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we could be subject to the potential risk of product liability intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities in addition as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability or at least legal action that could harm our reputation 

  

customs policies or legislative import restrictions could hinder the company’s ability to import goods necessary to our operations on a timely basis and result in government enforcement actions andor sanctions 

  

governmentimposed import policies and legislation regulating the import of goods and prohibiting the use of forced labor or human trafficking could result in delays or the inability to import goods in a timely manner that are necessary to our operations and such policies or legislation could also result in financial penalties other sanctions government enforcement actions and reputational harm while the company has policies against and seeks to avoid the import of goods that are manufactured in whole or in part by forced labor or through human trafficking as a result of legislative and governmental policy initiatives we may be subject to increasing potential delays added costs supply chain disruption and other restrictions 

  

general risks 

  

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if such products services or systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time 

  

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store customer product supplier and employee data to among other things 

  

• maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers 

• process payments to suppliers and 

• provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic medical or dental records including protected health information of their patients 

  

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems including thirdparty systems we rely on causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems including thirdparty systems we rely on andor the loss of business information as well as claims against us by affected parties andor governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses in addition we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our 

  

products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies in particular certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers such as physicians and dentists are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve damages fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses in addition a cyberattack on a thirdparty that we use to manage a portion of our information systems could result in the same effects additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services 

  

from time to time we have had to address nonmaterial security incidents “security incidents” there can be no assurance that we will not experience security incidents in the future security incidents can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm while we have implemented measures to protect our is systems such measures may not prevent these events any such security incidents could disrupt our operations harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business we have various insurance policies including cybersecurity insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost to cover costs and expenses related to security incidents 

  

furthermore procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new is challenges and enhancing protections and conducting investigations and remediation may impose additional costs on us 

  

finally our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of is systems providers engaged by our customers such as internetbased services upon which our customers depend to access certain of our products 

  

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business 

  

our global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management and our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

  

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense burnout and turnover rates are increasing workplace concerns during the covid19 pandemic and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel additionally our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected 

  

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

recent developments 

  

covid19 pandemic 

  

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets in response many countries implemented business closures and restrictions stayathome and social distancing ordinances and similar measures to combat the pandemic which significantly impacted global business and dramatically reduced demand for dental products and certain medical products in the second quarter of 2020 demand increased in the second half of 2020 and continued throughout 2021 resulting in growth over the prior year driven by sales of ppe covid19 tests and other covid19 related products 

  

our consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by us that affect among other things our goodwill longlived asset and definitelived intangible asset valuation inventory valuation equity investment valuation assessment of the annual effective tax rate valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies the allowance for doubtful accounts hedging activity supplier rebates measurement of compensation cost for certain sharebased performance awards and cash bonus plans and pension plan assumptions due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of covid19 our judgments regarding estimates and impairments could change in the future in addition the impact of covid19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows in the second quarter of 2020 in the latter half of the second quarter of 2020 dental and medical practices began to reopen worldwide and continued to do so during the second half of 2020 during the year ended december 25 2021 patient traffic levels returned to levels approaching prepandemic levels there is an ongoing risk that the covid19 pandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity however the extent of the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

  

policies rules and regulations relating to vaccine mandates currently vary by jurisdiction and by customer in the united states the vaccine mandate requiring that all federal contractors be vaccinated was stayed in december 2021 and is currently pending litigation in addition in january 2022 the united states supreme court blocked a federal mandate that would require businesses with more than 100 employees to make their employees receive a covid19 vaccination or undergo weekly covid19 testing in addition state governments and some customers have also issued vaccine requirements for workers in their jurisdictions or who may service their accounts and some state regulations contradict the contemplated federal vaccine mandates also various international jurisdictions have or may in the future impose vaccine mandates or additional covid19 regulations the imposition of government or customer mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees attract new employees and retain certain product and service contracts it is possible that a significant number of our employees have not been vaccinated and in the event of a vaccine mandate some of those employees may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination the implementation of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily such labor shortages could also affect our ability to retain certain specific contracts to which the mandates may apply reduce our sales andor affect our ability to fulfill customer orders impacting our revenue and profitability furthermore managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt andor unvaccinated employees could potentially increase our costs as could addressing inconsistent mandates covid19 vaccine mandates and similar regulations have the potential to significantly adversely affect our business as the nature and effect of such mandates are uncertain at this time

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base our global dental businesses serve officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global medical businesses serve officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions 

  

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products dental specialty products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products dental specialty products including implant orthodontic and endodontic products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products ppe and vitamins 

  

our global technology and valueadded services business provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology business offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners our valueadded practice solutions include practice consultancy education revenue cycle management and financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as consulting and continuing education services for practitioners 

  

a key element to grow closer to our customers is our one schein initiative which is a unified gotomarket approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with our supply chain equipment sales and service and other valueadded services allowing our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a single program specifically one schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of national brand products our private label products and proprietary specialty products and solutions including implant orthodontic and endodontic products in addition customers have access to a wide range of services including software and other valueadded services 

  

industry overview 

  

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

  

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

  

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the covid19 pandemic the current economic environment and continued economic and public health uncertainty since the onset of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 we have been carefully monitoring its impact on our global operations and have taken appropriate steps to minimize the risk to our employees we have seen and expect to continue to see changes in demand trends for some of our products and services supply chain challenges and labor challenges as rates of infection fluctuate new strains or variants of covid19 emerge and spread vaccine uptake and mandates increase and change governments adapt their approaches to combatting the virus including without limitation vaccine mandates and local conditions change across geographies for example vaccine mandates affecting our workforce whether imposed through government regulations or contracts with governmental authorities or other customers could potentially cause staffing shortages if employees choose not to comply as well as other consequences to our business or operations managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt employees could potentially increase our costs as could addressing inconsistent covid19 vaccination mandates as a result we expect to see continued volatility through at least the duration of the pandemic 

  

  

industry consolidation 

  

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

  

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

  

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

  

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful in response to the covid19 pandemic we had taken a range of actions to preserve cash including the temporary suspension of significant acquisition activity during the second half of 2020 as global conditions improved we resumed our acquisition strategy 

  

aging population and other market influences 

  

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

  

according to the us census bureau’s international database in 2021 there were more than six and a half million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare 

  

services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 32 during the same period 

  

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure data” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 41 trillion in 2020 or 197 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 62 trillion in 2028 approximately 197 of the nation’s projected gross domestic product the latest projections begin after the latest historical year 2018 and go through 2028 these projections do not take into account the impacts of covid19 because of the timing of the report and the highly uncertain nature of the pandemic 

  

government 

  

our businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance and failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

see “ item 1 business – governmental regulations ” for a discussion of laws regulations and governmental activity that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

results of operations 

  

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2020 annual report on form 10k for management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

  

the following tables summarize the significant components of our operating results and cash flows from continuing operations in thousands 

  

   

plans of restructuring 

  

on november 20 2019 we committed to a contemplated restructuring initiative intended to mitigate stranded costs associated with the animal health spinoff and to rationalize operations and to provide expense efficiencies these activities were originally expected to be completed by the end of 2020 in light of the changes to the business environment brought on by the covid19 pandemic we extended such activities to the end of 2021 

  

during the years ended december 25 2021 december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 we recorded restructuring charges of 79 million 321 million and 147 million respectively the restructuring costs for these periods included costs for severance benefits and facility exit costs the costs associated with these restructurings are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income 

  

our restructuring activities under this initiative are now complete and we do not expect to report any restructuring costs separately in 2022 

  

2021 compared to 2020 

  

net sales 

  

net sales were as follows in thousands 

  

 

1 consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products dental specialty products including implant orthodontic and endodontic products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products ppe and vitamins 

2 consists of practice management software and other valueadded products which are distributed primarily to health care providers practice consultancy education revenue cycle management and financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices continuing education services for practitioners consulting and other services 

3 corporate tsa revenues represents sales of certain products to covetrus under the transition services agreement entered into in connection with the animal health spinoff which ended in december 2020 see note23 related party transactions for further information 

  

the 226 increase in net sales consists of an increase of 211 in local currency revenue 169 increase in internally generated revenue and 42 growth from acquisitions and an increase of 15 related to foreign currency exchange excluding sales of products under the transition services agreement with covetrus our net sales increased 235 consisting of an increase in local currency revenue of 220 178 increase in internally generated revenue and 42 growth from acquisitions and an increase of 15 related to foreign currency exchange we estimate that sales for the year ended december 25 2021 of ppe and covid19 related products were approximately 17442 million an estimated increase of 342 versus the prior year excluding ppe and covid19 related products the estimated increase in internally generated local currency sales excluding corporate tsa revenues was 167 

  

the 276 increase in dental net sales consists of an increase of 252 in local currency revenue 207 increase in internally generated revenue and 45 growth from acquisitions and an increase of 24 related to foreign currency exchange the 252 increase in local currency sales was attributable to an increase in dental consumable merchandise revenue of 262 206 increase in internally generated revenue and 56 growth from acquisitions and an increase in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 219 211 increase in internally generated revenue and 08 growth from acquisitions the covid19 pandemic began to adversely impact our worldwide dental revenue beginning in midmarch of 2020 as many dental offices progressively closed or began seeing a limited number of patients however in the second half of the quarter ended june 27 2020 and continuing through the year ended december 25 2021 patient traffic stabilized and approached prepandemic levels the growth in dental revenues reflects this recovery additionally we estimate that global dental sales for the year ended december 25 2021 of ppe and covid19 related products were approximately 6809 million an estimated increase of 382 versus the prior year excluding ppe and covid19 related products the estimated increase in internally generated local currency dental sales was 213 

  

the 166 increase in medical net sales is attributable to an increase of 165 in local currency growth 137 increase in internally generated revenue and 28 growth from acquisitions and an increase of 01 related to foreign currency exchange our medical business has continued to have strong sales of ppe such as masks gowns and face shields and other covid19 related products such as diagnostic kits globally we estimate our medical business recorded sales of approximately 10633 million of such ppe and other covid19 related products for the year ended december 25 2021 an increase of approximately 318 compared to the prior year excluding ppe and other covid19 related products the estimated increase in internally generated local currency medical sales was 87 

  

  

the 246 increase in technology and valueadded services net sales is attributable to an increase of 235 in local currency revenue 130 increase in internally generated revenue and 105 growth from acquisitions and 11 related to foreign currency exchange the closure of dental and medical offices beginning in midmarch of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower technology and valueadded services revenues in 2020 especially in the second quarter of that year the growth in revenues in 2021 reflects the recovery of activity approaching prepandemic levels in our practice management business as well as strong financial services revenue which benefitted from dental equipment sales growth 

  

gross profit 

  

gross profit and gross margin percentages by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

  

   

as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology and valueadded services segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in development 

  

during december 2020 our transition services agreement with covetrus in connection with the completion of the animalhealth spinoff concluded under this agreement covetrus had agreed to purchase certain products from us at a markup that ranged from 3 to 6 of our product cost to cover handling costs 

  

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

  

health care distribution gross profit increased 7917 million or 323 primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 276 from 257 although we recorded significant adjustments to inventory in 2021 primarily related to ppe inventory these adjustments were less than in 2020 and contributed to the improved gross profit margin such adjustments to inventory may recur and adversely impact gross profit margins in future periods although we do not expect further significant inventory adjustments the increase in the health care distribution gross profit margin is also attributable to an increase in supplier rebates during 2021 due to increased purchase volumes the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a 5007 million increase in internally generated revenue 1769 million in gross profit due to the increase in the gross margin rates and 1141 million additional gross profit from acquisitions 

  

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 684 million or 188 due to an increase of 509 million in internally generated revenue and 316 million additional gross profit from acquisitions partially offset by a 141 million decrease due to the lower gross profit margin technology and valueadded services gross profit margin decreased to 673 from 706 primarily due to lower gross margins of recently acquired companies in the business services sector and certain transactions with the us federal government 

  

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

   

selling general and administrative expenses including restructuring costs increased 5417 million or 238 in the prior year there were significant costsaving measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic these costsaving measures were temporary and substantially ended during the third quarter of 2020 

  

the 4978 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment was attributable to an increase of 4115 million of operating costs and an increase of 1113 million of additional costs from acquired companies partially offset by a decrease of 250 million in restructuring costs the 439 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our technology and valueadded services segment was attributable to an increase of 288 million of additional costs from acquired companies an increase of 143 million of operating costs and an increase of 08 million in restructuring costs 

  

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 2948 million or 217 to 16556 million primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related costs as a percentage of net sales selling expenses decreased to 134 from 135 

  

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 2469 million or 269 to 11650 million primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related costs as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased to 94 from 91 

  

other expense net 

  

other expense net was as follows in thousands 

  

   

interest expense decreased 138 million primarily due to reduced credit line borrowings 

  

income taxes 

  

for the year ended december 25 2021 our effective tax rate was 238 compared to 191 for the prior year period in 2021 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by state and foreign income taxes and interest expense in 2020 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the agreement with the us internal revenue service on our advanced pricing agreement apa other audit resolutions and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense 

  

gain on sale of equity investment 

  

in the third quarter of 2021 we received contingent proceeds of 98 million from the 2019 sale of hufriedy resulting in the recognition of an additional aftertax gain of 73 million we also received contingent proceeds in 2020 of 21 million resulting in the recognition of an additional gain of 16 million aftertax no further proceeds are expected from this sale 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock which had been temporarily suspended in april 2020 but were resumed in early march 2021 working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

  

the pandemic and the governmental responses to it had a material adverse effect on our cash flows in the second quarter of 2020 in the latter half of the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through 2021 dental and medical practices began to reopen worldwide during 2021 patient traffic levels returned to levels approaching prepandemic levels there is an ongoing risk that the covid19 pandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity however the extent of the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

  

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements please see note 12 – debt for further information our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

  

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

  

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs 

  

net cash from continuing operations provided by operating activities was 7096 million for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to net cash from continuing operations provided by operating activities of 5935 million for the prior year the net change of 1161 million was primarily attributable to higher net income partially offset by increased working capital requirements specifically an increase in inventories due to ongoing stocking of ppe and covid19 related products and reduced accounts payable and accrued expenses these working capital increases were partially offset by lower growth in accounts receivable as days sales outstanding were lower than in the prior year 

  

net cash from continuing operations used in investing activities was 6772 million for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to 1150 million for the prior year the net change of 5622 million was primarily attributable to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions 

  

net cash from continuing operations used in financing activities was 3330 million for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1818 million for the prior year the net change of 1512 million was primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock partially offset by decreased net proceeds from bank borrowings 

  

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

  

   

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 

  

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations decreased to 418 days as of december 25 2021 from 460 days as of december 26 2020 during the years ended december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 we wrote off approximately 85 million and 78 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turnover from operations was 52 as of december 25 2021 and 51 as of december 26 2020 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt and finance lease obligations including interest assuming a weighted average interest rate of 32 as well as inventory purchase commitments and operating lease obligations as of december 25 2021

we have operating and finance leases for corporate offices office space distribution and other facilities vehicles and certain equipment our leases have remaining terms of less than one year to approximately 20 years some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years as of december 25 2021 our rightofuse assets related to operating leases were 3250 million and our current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities were 764 million and 2678 million respectively please see note 6 – leases for further information 

  

stock repurchases 

  

on march 8 2021 we announced the reinstatement of our share repurchase program which had been temporarily suspended in april of 2020 

  

from june 21 2004 through december 25 2021 we repurchased 40 billion or 81068993 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 2000 million available as of december 25 2021 for future common stock share repurchases 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

  

some minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities accounting standards codification “asc” topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements as of december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 our balance for redeemable noncontrolling interests was 6133 million and 3277 million respectively please see note 17 – redeemable noncontrolling interests for further information 

  

unrecognized tax benefits 

  

as more fully disclosed in note 13 – income taxes of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 835 million as of december 25 2021 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 – basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties therefore reported results may differ from estimates and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

inventories and reserves 

  

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in estimating carrying value of inventory we consider many factors including the condition and 

  

salability of the inventory by reviewing onhand quantities historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends certain of our products specifically ppe and covid19 related items have experienced changes in net realizable value due to volatility of pricing and changes in demand for these products 

  

business combinations 

  

the estimated fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets trademarks and trade names customer relationships and lists noncompete agreements and product development is based on critical estimates judgments and assumptions derived from analysis of market conditions discount rates projected cash flows customer retention rates and estimated useful lives please see note 4 – business acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion of our acquisitions 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill is subject to impairment analysis at least once annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments global dental global medical and technology and valueadded services goodwill is allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis 

  

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services to the reporting units and ultimately the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by applying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with a market approach there are inherent uncertainties however related to fair value models the inputs and our judgments in applying them to this analysis the most significant inputs include estimation of detailed future cash flows based on budget expectations and determination of comparable companies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 

  

on an annual basis we prepare annual and mediumterm financial projections these projections are based on input from our leadership and are presented annually to our board of directors influences on this years forecasted financial information and the fair value model include the impact of planned strategic initiatives the continued integration of recent acquisitions and overall market conditions the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors 

  

our thirdparty valuation specialists provide inputs into our determination of the discount rate the rate is dependent on a number of underlying assumptions including the riskfree rate tax rate equity risk premium debt to equity ratio and pretax cost of debt 

  

longterm growth rates are applied to our estimation of future cash flows the longterm growth rates are tied to growth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have forecasted operating results we also consider external benchmarks and other data points which we believe are applicable to our industry and the composition of our global operations 

  

based on our quantitative assessment we believe the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceeds the carrying values as part of our analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm growth rate assumptions the sensitivities led us to the same conclusion that no impairment exists 

  

definitelived intangible assets 

  

annually definitelived intangible assets such as noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer relationships and lists and product development are reviewed for impairment indicators if any impairment indicators exist quantitative testing is performed on the asset 

  

the quantitative impairment model is a twostep test under which we first calculate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing the undiscounted probabilityweighted value of the projected cash flows associated 

  

with the asset or asset group including its estimated residual value to the carrying amount if the cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value we would perform a fair value assessment of the asset or asset group if the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

  

during the years ended december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 we recorded total impairment charges on definitelived intangible assets of approximately 07 and 203 million respectively nearly all of which was recorded in our technology and valueadded services segment 

  

income tax 

  

when determining if the realization of the deferred tax asset is likely by assessing the need for a valuation allowance estimates and judgement are required we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including estimated future taxable earnings ongoing planning strategies future reversals of existing temporary differences and historical operating results additionally changes to tax laws and statutory tax rates can have an impact on our determination our intention is to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 

  

asc topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance this topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect of certain tax matters please see note 13 – income taxes for further discussion 

  

accounting standards update 

  

for a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted or will be adopted in the future please see note 1 – basis of presentation and significant accounting policies included under item 8 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

  

foreign currency agreements 

  

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie generally 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2021 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2021 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 84 million 

  

as of december 25 2021 we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through november 16 2023 which include a marktomarket gain of 63 million as determined by quoted market prices included in the forward foreign currency exchange agreements henry schein inc had eurusd forward contracts notionally totaling an amount of approximately €200 million with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net gain of 65 million a 5 increase in the value of the euro to the usd from december 25 2021 with all other variables held constant would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these forward contracts by decreasing the value of these instruments by 107 million 

  

total return swaps 

  

on march 20 2020 we entered into a total return swap for the purpose of economically hedging our unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plan “serp” and our deferred compensation plan “dcp” this swap will offset changes in our serp and dcp liabilities at the inception the notional value of the investments in these plans was 434 million at december 25 2021 the notional value of the investments in these plans was 887 million at december 25 2021 the financing blended rate for this swap was based on libor of 009 plus 046 for a combined rate of 055 for the years ended december 25 2021 ended and december 26 2020 we have recorded a gain within the selling general and administrative line item in our consolidated statement of income of approximately 121 million and 212 million respectively net of transaction costs related to this undesignated swap this swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis after its current expiration date of march 29 2022 and is expected to result in a neutral impact to our results of operations 

  

shortterm investments 

  

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties 

  

  

variable interest rate debt 

  

as of december 25 2021 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization 

  

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on august 20 2021 and expires on august 20 2026 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 25 2021 there was 00 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility during the year ended december 25 2021 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 15 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by less than 01 million 

  

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and expires on october 18 2024 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate as of december 25 2021 the commercial paper rate was 019 plus 075 for a combined rate of 094 at december 25 2021 the outstanding balance was 1050 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 25 2021 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 440 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 01 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e promulgated under the exchange act based on this evaluation our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 25 2021 to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

the combination of acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations undertaken during the quarter and carried over from prior quarters as well as changes to the operating methods of some of our internal controls over financial reporting due to the covid19 pandemic when considered in the aggregate represents a material change in our internal control over financial reporting 

  

during the quarter ended december 25 2021 we completed the acquisition of a dental business in north america with annual revenues of approximately 62 million in addition postacquisition integration related activities continued for our medical and dental businesses acquired during prior quarters representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately 429 million these acquisitions the majority of which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition 

  

all acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations involve necessary and appropriate changemanagement controls that are considered in our quarterly assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

in addition as a result of a combination of continued government imposed and company directed closures of some of our facilities due to the covid19 pandemic we have had to maintain a number of changes to the operating methods of some of our internal controls for example moving from manual signoffs and inperson meetings to electronic signoffs and electronic communications such as email and telephonic or video conference due to outofoffice working arrangements however the design of our internal control framework and objectives over financial reporting remains unchanged and we do not believe that these changes have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

business 

 

general 

 

henry schein inc is a solutions company for health care professionals powered  

by a network of people and 

technology we  

believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office

based dental and medical practitioners as well as alternate sites of care  

our philosophy is grounded in our 

commitment to help customers operate a more efficient and successful business so  

the practitioner can provide 

better clinical care 

 

with more than 88 years of experience distributing health care products we have built a vast set of small  

midsized 

and large customers in the dental and medical markets serving more than one  

million customers worldwide across 

dental practices and laboratories and physician practices as well as government  

institutional health care clinics and 

other alternate care clinics  

 

we are headquartered in melville new york  

employ more than 19000 people of which approximately 9800 are 

based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 31 countries and  

territories including the 

united states australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china  

the czech republic france germany 

hong kong sar ireland israel italy japan liechtenstein luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new 

zealand poland portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland  

thailand united arab emirates 

and the united kingdom  

this broad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well  

as 

through contribution from strategic acquisitions 

 

our business extends far beyond our supply chain capabilities across  

the globe we provide a wide breadth 

of products valueadded solutions and support to customers including  

consumables and equipment through 

henry schein one we offer dental practice management patient engagement  

and demand creation software 

solutions we also offer a broad range of financial services for our customers to help them operate and expand their 

business operations we believe our handson consultative approach to support practice decisionmaking is a key 

differentiator for our business 

 

we offer  

a comprehensive selection of more than 120000 branded products  

and henry schein private brand 

products in stock as well as more than 180000 additional products  

available as specialorder items 

 

as the market continues to evolve toward solutions that offer ease and convenience for  

ordering products and 

communicating with our solutions teams we are investing in digital enhancements  

to our ecommerce platforms 

and our web capabilities 

 

we have established over 35 million square feet of space in 28 strategically located distribution centers around the 

world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating  

efficiency  

our infrastructure allows us 

to provide rapid and accurate order fulfillment historically approximately 99 of items have been shipped 

without back ordering and were shipped on the same business day the order  

is received  

due to the significant 

increase in demand for personal protective equipment “ppe” as a result  

of the covid19 pandemic during the 

year ended december 26 2020 approximately 93 of items ordered  

were shipped without back ordering and 90 

were shipped on the same business day the order was received  

as the demand for ppe stabilizes we expect our 

percentage of items shipped without back ordering and shipped on the  

same day to return to historic levels  

this 

infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive  

prices and a strong commitment to 

customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’  

needs 

 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and 

valueadded services  

these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base  

 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global  

dental and medical operating segments  

this 

combined dental and medical segment distributes consumable products  

small equipment laboratory products large 

equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals  

vaccines surgical products diagnostic 

 

 

tests infectioncontrol products  

and vitamins  

our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners 

dental laboratories schools government and other institutions  

our global medical group serves physician offices 

urgent care centers ambulatory care sites emergency medical technicians dialysis centers home health  

federal 

and state governments and large enterprises such as group practices and integrated  

delivery networks among other 

providers across a wide range of specialties  

while our primary gotomarket strategy is in our capacity as a 

distributor we also manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of implants orthodontics  

and 

endodontics we have achieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions as manufacturers of 

these products typically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers  

 

as an alternative to branded product options we also market under our own  

private label portfolio of costeffective 

highquality consumable merchandise products for our dental and medical customers  

sales of our private label 

products generally achieve gross profit margins that are higher than the average margin on the other  

products we 

sell  

 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software  

technology and other valueadded 

services to health care practitioners  

henry schein one the largest contributor of sales to this category offers 

software systems for dental practitioners this segment also includes a  

small medical software business known as 

micromd in addition we offer physicians a broad suite of electronic health records  

integrated revenue cycle 

management and patient communication services finally our valueadded practice solutions include financial 

service offerings which include practice finance solutions such as credit card billing  

and facilitation of customer 

loans on a nonrecourse basis to acquire equipment and technology as well as solutions to broker dental practice 

transitions we do not take on the liability of such loans but instead receive an origination fee for coordinating 

loans between practice customers and thirdparty banking groups 

 

recent developments 

 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent 

developments” herein for a discussion related to the covid19  

pandemic and recent corporate transactions 

 

industry 

 

the global health care distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and 

diverse  

the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of  

relatively small offices to midsized and large 

group practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several hundred  

practices owned or operated by dental 

support organizations dsos hospital systems or integrated delivery networks  

idns 

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage  

large quantities of supplies 

in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health  

care practitioners 

has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for  

rapid reliable and substantially complete 

order fulfillment  

the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically  

made by the 

practitioner hygienist or office manager  

supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from  

more than 

one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

 

the health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due  

to demand driven by the aging population 

increased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care  

an increasing understanding of the 

connection between good oral health and overall health improved access  

to care globally the proliferation of 

medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and  

expanded thirdparty insurance coverage 

partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological improvements  

including 

the advancement of software and services prosthetic solutions and telemedicine  

in addition the nonacute market 

continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic  

testing from acute care settings to alternatecare 

sites particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers 

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly 

those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking  

to combine with larger companies that can 

provide growth opportunities  

this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking  

to acquire 

 

 

companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide  

opportunities to serve a broader 

customer base  

 

in addition customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations  

under common management and the 

movement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician  

or alternate care setting as the health care 

industry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment  

this trend has benefited distributors capable 

of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices  

it also has accelerated the growth of hmos 

group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying  

groups which in addition to their emphasis on 

obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable  

of providing specialized management 

information support  

we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect 

demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance  

the efficiency and facilitation of practice 

management 

 

competition  

 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is  

highly competitive  

many of the health 

care products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers  

in addition our competitors could 

obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products  

manufacturers also could seek to sell 

directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other  

distributors in certain parts of the 

dental end market such as those related to dental specialty products  

manufacturers already sell directly to end 

customers 

 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several  

manufacturers of dental and medical 

products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line ecommerce  

capabilities customer service and 

valueadded products and services  

in the dental market our primary competitors in the us are the patterson 

dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply  

company  

in addition we compete against 

a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and  

local level our primary competitors in the 

us medical market which accounts for the large majority of our global medical  

sales are mckesson corporation 

and medline industries inc which are national distributors  

we also compete with a number of regional and local 

medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that  

sell directly to physicians  

with regard to our dental 

software we compete against numerous companies including the patterson  

dental division of patterson 

companies inc carestream health inc open dental software inc planetdds  

llc good methods global inc 

dba carestack and curve dental llc  

in other software end markets including revenue cycle  

management 

patient relationship management and patient demand generation we  

compete with companies such as vyne 

therapeutics inc edihealth group inc dba dental x change inc  

weave communications 

inc solutionreach inc zocdoc inc localmed inc and prosites inc  

the medical practice management and 

electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with  

numerous companies such as the 

nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts healthcare solutions inc and epic systems 

corporation  

 

outside of the us we believe we are the only global distributor of supplies  

and equipment to dental practices and 

our competitors are primarily local and regional companies  

we also face significant competition internationally 

where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against  

several large competitors including the 

gacd group proclinic sa lifco ab planmeca oy and billericay dental  

supply co ltd as well as a large 

number of other dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers

business strategy 

 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider  

of health care products and services to 

officebased dental and medical practitioners by increasing their efficiency and success  

to accomplish this we 

will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

•  

increase penetration of our existing customer base

 

we have over 1 million customers worldwide and we 

intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position  

as their primary supplier 

we believe our offering of a broad range of products services and support including software solutions 

that can help drive improved workflow efficiency and patient communications for  

practices coupled with 

our fullservice value proposition helps us to retain and grow our customer  

base 

 

•  

increase the number of customers we serve

 

this strategy includes increasing the productivity of our field 

sales consultants and telesales team as well as using our customer  

database to focus our marketing efforts 

in all of our operating segments  

in the dental business we provide products and services to  

independent 

practices midmarket groups and large dsos as well as community health centers and government  

sites of 

care  

leveraging our broad array of assets and capabilities we offer solutions to address these  

new 

markets  

in the medical business we have expanded to serve customers  

located in settings outside of the 

traditional office such as urgent care clinics retail occupational health and home health settings  

as 

settings of health care shift we remain committed to serving these practitioners  

and providing them with 

the products and services they need 

 

•  

leverage our valueadded products and services

 

we continue to increase crossselling efforts for key 

product lines utilizing a consultative selling process  

in the dental business we have significant cross

selling opportunities between our dental software users and our dental distribution  

customers  

in the 

medical business we have opportunities to expand our vaccine injectables  

and other pharmaceuticals sales 

to health care practitioners as well as crossselling electronic health record  

and software when we sell our 

core products  

our strategy extends to providing health systems integrated  

delivery networks and other 

large group and multisite health care organizations including physician clinics these same value  

added 

 

 

products and services  

as physicians and health systems closely align we have increased  

access to 

opportunities for crossmarketing and selling our product and service portfolios 

 

•  

pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures

 

our acquisition strategy is focused on investments in 

companies that add new customers and sales teams increase our geographic  

footprint whether entering a 

new country such as emerging markets or building scale where we have already invested in businesses 

and finally those that enable us to access new products and technologies 

 

markets served  

 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an  

aging us population is increasingly using health 

care services  

between 2020 and 2030 the 45 and older population is expected  

to grow by approximately 11  

between 2020 and 2040  

this age group is expected to grow by approximately 22  

this compares with expected 

total us population growth rates of approximately 7  

between 2020 and 2030 and approximately 12 between 

2020 and 2040  

 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45andolder segment of 

the population increases  

there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow  

dentists to increase 

productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates  

at the same time there is 

an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important value

added services including practice management software electronic claims  

processing financial services and 

continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency  

 

in the medical market there continues to be a migration of procedures from  

acutecare settings to physicians’ 

offices and home health settings  

a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us  

there also is the 

continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare  

settings  

we believe we have 

established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician  

practitioner 

 

additionally we seek to expand our dental fullservice model and our medical offerings in countries where 

opportunities exist  

through our “schein direct” program we also have the  

capability to provide doortodoor air 

package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world  

 

for information on revenues and longlived assets by geographic area see 

note 18 – segment and geographic data 

 

of “notes to consolidated financial statements”  

 

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings  

as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of 

securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price  

to decline 

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations  

revenues and profitability generally have been 

higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal  

products including influenza vaccine 

equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners  

and yearend 

promotions revenues and profitability may also be impacted by  

the timing of certain annual and biennial dental 

tradeshows where equipment promotions are offered in addition some dental practices  

delay equipment purchases 

in the us until yearend due to tax incentives  

revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first 

quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters  

we expect our historical seasonality of sales to 

continue in the foreseeable future  

 

 

governmental regulations 

 

we strive to be substantially compliant with the applicable laws regulations and guidance described below and 

believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial  

compliance 

however compliance is not guaranteed  

either now or in the future as certain laws regulations and guidance  

may 

be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply as well as future changes 

additions and enforcement approaches including in light of political changes  

for example president biden’s 

administration has authorized and encouraged a freeze on certain federal  

regulations that have been published but 

are not yet effective as well as a review of all federal regulations issued during president trump’s administration  

changes with respect to the applicable laws regulations and guidance described  

below may require us to update or 

revise our operations services marketing practices and compliance programs  

and controls and may impose 

additional and unforeseen costs on us pose new or previously immaterial  

risks to us or may otherwise have a 

material adverse effect on our business 

 

government 

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution importation exportation  

marketing and sale of and third party 

payment for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state 

federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations including as applicable  

to our wholesale distribution of 

pharmaceuticals and medical devices and as part of our specialty home medical supply  

business that distributes and 

sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients  

the federal government and state governments have also 

increased enforcement activity in the health care sector particularly in areas of fraud and abuse antibribery  

and 

corruption controlled substances prescribing medical device regulation and data  

privacy and security standards  

 

government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care  

and there have 

been efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs including efforts  

thus far unsuccessful to 

seek repeal of the entire united states patient protection and affordable care act  

as amended by the health care 

and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 as amended  

the “aca”  

in addition activities to 

control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement  

rates for pharmaceuticals medical 

devices andor medical treatments or services are ongoing  

many of these laws and regulations are subject to 

change and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our  

financial performance 

 

our businesses are also generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations  

that could impact our financial 

performance including securities antitrust consumer protection antibribery  

and antikickback customer 

interaction transparency data privacy  

data security government contracting and other laws and regulations  

 

failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution importation exportation  

marketing  

and sale of and third party 

payment for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local  

state federal 

and foreign governmental laws and regulations including as applicable  

to our wholesale distribution and sale of 

pharmaceuticals and medical devices and as part of our specialty home medical  

supply business that distributes 

and sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients  

among the united states federal laws applicable to 

us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic  

act as amended “fdc act” and 

section 361 of the public health service act as well as laws regulating the  

billing of and reimbursement from 

government programs such as medicare and medicaid and from commercial payers  

we are also subject to 

comparable foreign regulations 

 

the fdc act the controlled substances act their implementing regulations  

and similar foreign laws generally 

regulate the introduction manufacture advertising marketing and promotion  

sampling pricing and 

reimbursement labeling packaging storage handling returning or recalling  

reporting and distribution of and 

record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states  

may similarly 

regulate such activities within the state  

furthermore section 361 of the public health service act which  

provides 

authority to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable  

diseases serves as the legal basis for 

 

 

the united states  

food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and 

tissuebased products also known as “hctp products” 

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant  

changes with respect to 

pharmaceutical supply chain requirements  

title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act 

“dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended  

to build a national electronic 

interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they  

are distributed in the united states  

the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg 

pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be  

implemented  

the dscsa 

product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements  

and preempt certain state 

requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition  

to the dscsa requirements 

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation  

of prescription drug wholesalers 

and thirdparty logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual  

creation of national wholesaler and 3pl 

licenses in cases where states do not  

license such entities  

the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls 

distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping  

storage and handling of 

prescription drugs  

the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports  

to the fda which include 

information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the  

name and address of each facility and 

contact information  

according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing  

any licensing requirements 

that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered  

by the standards established by federal 

law in this area  

current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will  

remain in effect until the fda 

issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa  

in addition with respect to our specialty home medical supply 

business we are subject to certain state licensure laws including state pharmacy  

laws and also certain 

accreditation standards including to qualify for reimbursement from  

medicare and other thirdparty payers 

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and  

the food and drug administration safety and 

innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate  

regulations to implement a unique 

device identification “udi” system  

the udi rule phased in the implementation of the udi  

regulations 

generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices  

and ending with the lowestrisk 

devices  

most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018  

with a final set of requirements for low 

risk devices being reached on september 24 2022 which will complete  

the phase in  

the udi regulations require 

“labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content  

and format prescribed by the fda and 

issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical 

devices including but not limited to certain software that qualifies as a medical device  

under fda rules and to 

directly mark certain devices with udis  

the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information 

concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly  

available on an fda database 

the global unique device identification database  

the udi regulations and subsequent fda guidance regarding 

the udi requirements provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions  

for example the udi 

regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality  

system regulation other than 

recordkeeping requirements and complaint files  

regulated labelers include entities such as device 

manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with 

the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent  

replacement or modification of 

the label and include certain of our businesses 

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances  

we are required to obtain and renew 

annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement  

administration “dea” 

permitting us to handle controlled substances  

we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements 

relating to the storage sale marketing handling reporting recordkeeping  

and distribution of such drugs in 

accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations  

and these requirements have been 

subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times  

we are subject to inspection by the dea certain of our 

businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and  

comply with operating and security 

standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health  

and human services “hhs” and 

various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable 

foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of  

operations and location of product 

distribution manufacturing or sale  

these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage 

 

 

prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or  

own pharmacy operations or 

install maintain or repair equipment  

 

in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil 

andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example  

human bone products for valuable 

consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs  

incurred in procuring processing 

storing and distributing that tissue  

we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products  

the 

dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement  

powers including the ability 

to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers  

seize or order the recall of products and 

impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of  

these laws and regulations  

foreign 

regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers 

 

eu regulation of medicinal and dental products  

 

eu member states regulate their own healthcare systems as does eu law  

the latter regulates certain matters 

most notably medicinal products and medical devices medicinal products are defined  

broadly as substances or 

combinations of substances having certain functionalities and may not include  

medical devices eu “regulations” 

apply in all member states whereas “directives” are implemented by the  

individual laws of member states  

 

on medicines for humans we are regulated under directive no 200183ec  

of 6 november 2001 and eu 

regulation no 7262004 of 31 march 2004  

these rules provide for the authorization of products and regulate 

their manufacture importation marketing and distribution  

it implements requirements which may be 

implemented without warning as well as a national pharmacovigilance  

system under which marketing 

authorizations may be withdrawn and includes potential sanctions for breaches  

of the rules and on other bases 

such as harmfulness or inefficiency  

 

eu regulation no 12232009 of 30 november 2009 

on cosmetic products

 

requires that cosmetic products which 

includes dental products be safe for human health when used under normal  

or reasonably foreseeable conditions of 

use and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer importer and distributor it includes market 

surveillance and noncompliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of  

products along with other sanctions  

 

in the european union the eu medical device regulation no 2017745  

“eu mdr” covers a wide scope of our 

activities from dental material to xray machines and certain software  

it was meant to become applicable three 

years after publication in may 2020 however on april 23 2020 to allow european economic area  

“eea” 

national authorities notified bodies manufacturers and other actors to focus  

fully on urgent priorities related to the 

covid19 pandemic the european council and parliament adopted regulation  

2020561 postponing the date of 

application of the eu mdr by one year to may 2021  

in the meantime rules provided for by directive no 

90385eec of 20 june 1990 

on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to active implantable 

medical devices

 

remain applicable in particular to certain software

identify importers and distributors and medical device products through  

registration in a database 

eudamed not due until 2022 and after  

 

 

 

in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory 

requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the 

distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance  

medical devices that have 

been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may  

continue to be placed on the market 

until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier  

however requirements regarding the 

distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance  

have to be observed by 

manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

 

other eu regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances  

include eu regulation no 19072006 of 18 

december 2006 

concerning the registration evaluation authorisation and  

restriction of chemicals

 which 

requires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import  

in the eu beyond certain quantities and the 

eu regulation no 12722008 of 16 december 2008 on classification labelling  

and packaging of substances and 

mixtures “clp regulation” which sets various obligations with respect  

to the labelling and packaging of 

concerned substances and mixtures 

 

furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future  

require us to delay product 

release sale or distribution or institute voluntary recalls of products we sell  

each of which could result in 

regulatory and enforcement actions financial losses and potential reputational  

harm  

our customers are also 

subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation which  

may affect our interactions 

with customers including the design and functionality of our products 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state  

local and foreign laws and regulations 

including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and  

disposal of hazardous or potentially 

hazardous substances and safe working conditions  

in addition certain of our businesses must operate in 

compliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and  

recordkeeping requirements in order to 

substantiate claims for payment under federal state and commercial healthcare  

reimbursement programs 

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies  

and are subject to certain regulatory 

requirements specific to government contractors 

 

antitrust and consumer protection 

 

the federal government of the united states most us states and many  

foreign countries have antitrust laws that 

prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive as well as consumer  

protection laws that seek to 

protect consumers from improper business practices  

at the us federal level the federal trade commission 

oversees enforcement of these types of laws and states have similar government  

agencies violations of antitrust or 

consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions including criminal  

and civil penalties  

private plaintiffs 

may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged  

antitrust law violations including claims for 

treble damages  

eu law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules  

protecting consumers 

 

health care fraud 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar  

foreign health care fraud and abuse referral 

and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations  

some of these laws referred to as “false 

claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent  

claims for reimbursement to 

federal state and other health care payers and programs  

other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit 

soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral  

of a patient or ordering 

purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services  

that are 

paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs  

certain additional state and federal laws such 

as the federal physician selfreferral law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibit physicians and other 

health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician  

or family member has a 

financial relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services  

for example durable medical 

equipment and medical supplies unless an exception applies 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened  

enforcement activity over the past few 

years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who  

serve as whistleblowers by filing 

 

 

complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states  

under applicable false claims laws 

and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries  

penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be 

severe and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs  

including the loss of licenses and the 

ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could  

have a material adverse effect on our 

business  

also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  

regulatory or judicial authority in 

a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial  

defense and settlement 

expenses  

even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private  

relators could result in reputational 

harm and the incurring of substantial costs  

most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these  

state 

laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims  

act penalties as well as other 

fraud and abuse laws  

 

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns  

about 

financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians  

and dentists on the other  

as a result we 

regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate  

compliance 

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign 

operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery  

act german anticorruption laws 

and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal  

books and records which have been 

the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and  

abuse laws and regulations and 

have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial  

compliance we cannot predict 

whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in 

response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or failure  

to comply with applicable law could have 

a material adverse effect on our business 

 

affordable care act 

 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the  

health care and education 

reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 as amended the “aca”  

increased federal oversight of private 

health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed  

to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost 

of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage  

the aca 

also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health  

insurance  

 

the aca has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking  

to invalidate and congressional action 

seeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been  

implemented in 2012 the united 

states supreme court in upholding the constitutionality of the  

aca and its individual mandate provision requiring 

that people buy health insurance or else face a penalty simultaneously limited aca provisions requiring medicaid 

expansion making such expansion a statebystate decision in addition one of  

the major political parties in the 

united states remains committed to seeking the aca’s legislative repeal but legislative efforts to do so have 

previously failed to pass both chambers of congress  

under president trump’s administration a number of 

administrative actions were taken to materially weaken the aca including  

without limitation by permitting the 

use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support”  

for insurers providing policies 

under the aca the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 the “tax act” which contains a broad range of tax 

reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international  

tax provisions income tax add

back provisions and deductions also effectively repealed the aca’s  

individual mandate by zeroing out the penalty 

for noncompliance  

in the most recent aca litigation the federal fifth circuit court  

of appeals found the 

individual mandate to be unconstitutional and returned the case to the district court  

for the northern district of 

texas for consideration of whether the remainder of the aca could survive the excision of the individual 

mandate  

the fifth circuit’s decision was appealed to the united states supreme court  

the supreme court heard 

argument on the appeal on november 10 2020 and a decision is anticipated soon  

any outcome of this case that 

changes the aca in addition to future legislation regulation guidance  

andor executive orders that do the same 

could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry 

 

an aca provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine  

act or open payments program the 

“sunshine act”  

imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug  

and device manufacturers and 

 

 

distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain  

covered recipients including 

physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors  

and for group purchasing 

organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting  

entity  

the centers for 

medicare and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these  

reports on a publicly available website 

including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital  

identities  

amendments expanded the 

law to also require reporting effective january  

1 2022 of payments or other transfers of value to physician 

assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered  

nurse anesthetists and certified nurse

midwives and this new requirement will be effective for data collected  

beginning in calendar year 2021  

the 

sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries  

may be required to report 

under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by  

the sunshine act and some of 

these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous  

we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring 

transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers  

 

in the united states government actions to seek to increase healthrelated price  

transparency may also affect our 

business  

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access  

and chip reauthorization act of 

2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework  

which modified certain 

medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and  

other practitioners  

under macra 

certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased  

incentive payment 

system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” through  

which medicare reimbursement to 

eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments  

that take into account quality 

promoting interoperability cost and improvement  

activities  

data collected in the first mips performance year 

2017 determined payment adjustments that began january 1 2019  

macra standards continue to evolve and 

represent a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected  

to provide substantial financial 

incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician  

information technology and 

reporting obligations  

the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain  

and will depend on future 

regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace  

new payment and delivery system reform programs 

including those modeled after such federal program are also increasingly being  

rolled out at the state level through 

medicaid administrators as well as through the private sector which may further alter the marketplace  

and impact 

our business  

 

recently in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs there has been increased scrutiny on 

drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the  

president executive branch 

agencies and various states at the state level several states have adopted  

laws that require drug manufacturers to 

provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information  

relating to those price increases while 

others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription  

drug affordability boards or multi

payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs  

at the federal level several related bills have been 

introduced and regulations proposed which if enacted or finalized  

respectively would impact drug pricing and 

related costs 

 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution  

industry in the united 

states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes  

we cannot predict what further reform 

proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

 

eu directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products  

 

eu law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are  

implemented by eu member 

states directive no 89105ec of 21 december 1988 

relating to the transparency of measures regulating the 

pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance  

systems

  

member states may subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon 

objective and verifiable criteria regulate the price charged or its increases for authorized  

medicines and their level 

of reimbursement or they may freeze prices place controls on the profitability  

of persons responsible for placing 

medicinal products on the market and include or exclude the medicine on  

the list of products covered by national 

health insurance systems  

 

 

 

eu law does not expressly include provisions like those of the sunshine act in  

the united states but a growing 

number of eu member states such as france since 2011 have enacted laws to increase the transparency  

of 

relationships in the healthcare sector the scope of these laws varies from on member state to another and may for 

example include the relations between healthcare industry players and  

physicians or their associations students 

preparing for medical professions or their associations teachers health  

establishments or publishers of prescription 

and dispensing assistance software 

 

regulated software electronic health records 

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of  

computer software and digital health 

products intended for use in health care settings  

the 21st century cures act the “cures act” signed into law on 

december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition  

to exclude certain software from 

fda regulation including clinical decision support software that meets certain  

criteria  

on september 27 2019 

the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which  

incorporated applicable cures act 

standards including  

regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are  

exempt from 

regulation by the fda as medical devices and continues to issue new guidance  

in this area  

certain of our 

businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products  

to support physician and dental 

practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government  

authorities could determine that one or 

more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one  

or more of our businesses to substantial 

additional requirements with respect to these products 

 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management  

products and our specialty home 

medical supply business include electronic information  

technology systems that store and process personal health 

clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals  

these information technology systems may be 

vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious  

attack which could require us to 

expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related  

security concerns and could involve 

claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies  

for example we are directly or indirectly 

subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and  

regulations that protect the privacy and 

security of personal information such as the federal health insurance portability  

and accountability act of 1996 

as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography 

and marketing act the telephone protection and electronic protection act of 1991 section 5 of the federal trade 

commission act the california privacy act “ccpa” and the california privacy rights act “cpra” that 

becomes effective on january 1 2023  

laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are  

continually 

evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations these requirements  

may not be harmonized may be 

interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction  

to another or may conflict with other 

rules or our practices  

our businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose  

us to breach 

of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses  

costs for remediation and harm to 

our reputation  

also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict  

the ability of our customers to obtain 

use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant  

additional costs to redesign our 

products to reflect these legal requirements which could have a material  

adverse effect on our operations  

 

also the european parliament and the council of the european union adopted  

the paneuropean general data 

protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased  

privacy rights for individuals in 

europe “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers  

and employees  

the gdpr 

extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors  

and generally imposes increased 

requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or  

services to data subjects or 

monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe  

noncompliance can result in penalties of 

up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues and  

data subjects may seek damages eu 

member states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties  

regarding certain matters such as 

employee personal data  

with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things 

company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data 

breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the 

storage use or other processing of the personal data  

the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating 

notably to information access modification erasure and transporting  

of the personal data  

 

 

 

in the united states the ccpa which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents became 

effective january 1 2020  

the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections 

regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information  

of california residents  

compliance 

with the new obligations imposed by the ccpa depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply 

them and because the ccpa is relatively new  

and its implementing regulations were released in august of  

2020 

there remains some uncertainty about how the ccpa will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the 

regulators if we fail to comply with the ccpa or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the ccpa 

we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation  

any of which may negatively impact our 

reputation require us to expend significant resources and harm our business  

furthermore california voters 

approved the cpra on november 3 2020 which will amend and  

expand the ccpa including by providing 

consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information  

and creating a new state agency to 

enforce the ccpa and the cpra  

the cpra will come into effect on january 1 2023 applying to information 

collected by businesses on or after january 1 2022  

 

other states as well as the federal government have increasingly  

considered the adoption of similarly expansive 

personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance  

while we believe we have 

substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with  

the gdpr ccpa and cpra requirements 

our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us  

and we cannot predict whether the 

interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response  

to new requirements or interpretations of 

the requirements  

could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and 

manage patient medical or dental records  

these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry 

standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of 

the privacy and security of those records and our products may  

also be used as part of these customers’ 

comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with  

applicable privacy 

and security laws  

perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services  

or the perceived or actual 

failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply  

with applicable legal or contractual data 

privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational  

harm but may also lead to claims 

against us by our customers andor governmental agencies  

and involve substantial fines penalties and other 

liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

 

various  

federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care  

providers of certain electronic health care 

records systems and processes  

the  

initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians  

and 

dentists through mips to use ehr technology in accordance with certain  

evolving requirements including 

regarding quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities  

qualification for the mips 

incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain  

capabilities designated in evolving 

standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health  

information technology  

of 

hhs “onc”  

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale  

of such certified ehr systems and 

other products linked to government supported incentive programs  

in order to maintain certification of our ehr 

products we must satisfy these changing governmental standards  

if any of our ehr systems do not meet these 

standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive  

federal incentive payments we may be 

exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws  

including the false claims act  

for 

example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155  

million settlement and 5year 

corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based  

on allegations that the vendor by 

misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false 

medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments  

in violation of the false claims act  

 

moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex 

functionality such as reporting functionality  

although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the  

effort 

may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product  

modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable 

standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic 

health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic  

transactions such as transactions 

involving claims submissions to third party payers  

failure to abide by these and other electronic health data 

 

 

transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims  

substantial fines penalties and other liabilities 

and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the 

ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged  

information becomes 

increasingly important  

for example on september 6 2017 the fda issued final  

guidance to assist industry in 

identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical  

devices to safely and effectively 

exchange and use exchanged information  

as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including 

those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a  

medical device 

 

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future  

impacting health care 

 

ecommerce 

 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health  

care supply and distribution 

relationships  

our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological  

developments and intense 

competition  

the continuing advancement of online commerce requires  

us to costeffectively adapt to changing 

technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a  

variety of new services to address the 

changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly  

in response to competitive 

offerings  

 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive 

alternatives  

we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built 

on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in  

this significant aspect of the distribution business  

we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including 

our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets 

 

international transactions 

 

united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to  

abide by certain standards relating to 

the importation and exportation of products  

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the 

conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices  

act the uk bribery act german 

anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to  

the accuracy of our internal books and 

records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those  

imposed in the united states 

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws  

and regulations promulgated 

thereunder and  

possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct  

of our business there can be no 

assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices  

will not have a material adverse effect 

on our business

certain policy and procedure changes in an effort to protect our tsms and customers  

and to support 

appropriate health and safety protocols  

while tsms at our manufacturing and distribution facilities as 

well as field sales consultants and equipment service technicians have  

continued to work onsite or in the 

field to provide vital services to our customers most tsms in administrative  

functions have effectively 

worked remotely since midmarch

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known  

to us or that we currently 

consider not to be material to our operations so you should not consider  

the risks disclosed in this section to 

necessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties  

the company believes that the following 

risks could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial  

results financial condition andor 

the trading price of our common stock  

the order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect  

their 

relative importance or priority  

 

company risks 

 

our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and  

liquidity may be negatively impacted by 

the effects of disease outbreaks epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public  

health concerns and other 

natural disasters

 

the covid19 pandemic and the responses of governments  

to it had and may again have a 

material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may  

result in a material 

adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 

 

our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and  

liquidity may be negatively impacted by the 

effects of disease outbreaks epidemics pandemics similar widespread public health concerns  

and other natural 

disasters the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have  

an unprecedented impact on society worldwide 

economic activity and the health care sector particularly the dental market as a global healthcare solutions 

company the covid19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had and may again have a material 

adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and may result in a  

material adverse effect on 

our financial condition and liquidity in march and april 2020 the dental market was severely impacted by 

covid19 with many if not a majority of practices being closed or open on a limited basis only although dental 

practice openings and patient volume recovery in the united states and  

many other countries have rebounded faster 

than originally anticipated patient volumes have remained below precovid19  

levels  

material uncertainty 

remains and the potential for additional significant resurgences of covid19  

could cause a significant reduction in 

dental practice openings and patient volume recovery or further delay the return to normal operations even  

after 

covid19 has subsided we may again experience material adverse  

impacts to our business results of operations 

and cash flows as a result of among other things its global economic  

impact including any recession that may 

occur in the future or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the  

reluctance of patients to return for elective 

dental or medical care the impacts and potential impacts from  

the covid19 pandemic include but are not 

limited to 

 

• 

significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of our products

 

for example in 

march and april 2020 many dental offices in the united states performed only emergency procedures  

and 

rescheduled wellness exams and elective procedures dental offices in other countries  

also experienced closures or 

restricted operations as did medical offices around the world such closures and restrictions  

impacted our 

customers’ spending with us and had and if reinstated may again have a material  

adverse effect on our business 

results of operations and cash flows although dental practice openings and  

patient volume recovery have 

rebounded faster than originally anticipated capacity constraints  

in offices and demandside factors may again lead 

to reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for our products additionally significant reduction in 

demand for certain of our products or customers’ decisions to delay  

the purchase of large equipment may result in 

us having increased inventory 

 

• 

shortage of certain personal protective equipment ppe

 supply chain disruptions for ppe and an increased 

demand for these products has resulted and may continue to result  

in backorders of certain ppe and a potential 

scarcity in raw materials to make certain ppe prices for certain ppe have been  

volatile although we believe that 

most practices currently are able to access adequate supply with some exceptions in certain markets depending on 

a number of factors including the progress of the virus and efforts to combat it we  

still may be unable to supply 

our customers with the quantity of certain ppe products they demand  

which may lead to our customers seeking 

alternative sources of supply furthermore healthcare professionals’ inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of 

certain ppe would  

adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows  

and could materially 

adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity conversely we recorded significant charges throughout the 

year beginning in the second quarter for ppe inventory due to volatility  

of pricing for ppe and depending upon 

 

 

the course of the pandemic if ppe pricing or demand decreases our  

margins and the value of certain our ppe 

inventory could be further negatively impacted in future periods which  

could result in a material adverse impact on 

our business results of operations and cash flows and our financial condition  

and liquidity 

 

• 

reduction in peoples’ ability and willingness to be in public

 

restrictions recommended by several public health 

organizations and implemented by many local governments to slow and limit the transmission  

of covid19 

including business closures and restrictions stayathome and similar measures  

were implemented and then lifted 

or partially lifted in some locations and reinstituted in others ongoing  

social distancing ordinances and similar 

restrictions and the actual and potential for additional resurgences of covid19  

has in some locations and may in 

other locations result in the reimposition or tightening of governmental  

social distancing and other restrictions 

andor cause people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental  

appointments which could again 

materially adversely affect demand for our products a lengthened period of materially  

suppressed demand could 

again cause material adverse impacts on our business results of operations  

and cash flows and could materially 

adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

 

• 

potential delays in customer payments or defaults on our customer credit arrangements

 

we generally sell 

products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash  

flows or operating and financial performance 

deteriorate due to the impact of covid19 or if they are unable to make scheduled  

payments or obtain credit they 

may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or 

impose more stringent payment terms the inability of current andor  

potential customers to pay us for our products 

andor services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms  

may materially adversely affect our 

business results of operations cash flows financial condition and  

liquidity and may limit the amounts we can 

borrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization 

 

 

• 

impact on third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us impact on our ability to meet obligations  

to third 

parties

 

failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors 

contractors including thirdparty shippers banks joint venture partners  

and external business partners to meet 

their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do  

so which may be caused by their own 

financial or operational difficulties or by travel restrictions and border closures may materially  

adversely affect 

our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and  

liquidity certain of our contracts with 

supply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions  

if we satisfy certain sales or 

purchasing targets that in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other  

cases we may not be able to 

fully satisfy due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic rebate income recognized in fiscal 2020 is less than 

rebates earned over the prior fiscal year our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate  

more 

favorable terms could materially adversely affect our business results of operations  

and cash flows 

 

• 

negative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices

 

the spread of covid19 caused us 

to implement temporary cost reduction measures including a payroll  

cost reduction plan centered around 

furloughs reduced pay and work hours voluntary unpaid time off suspension of company  

contributions to certain 

retirement plans and job reductions all of which have now ended except  

for a small number of tsms who remain 

on furlough modify our business practices including employee  

travel employee work locations and cancellation 

of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and  

we may take further actions as may be required 

by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests  

of our employees as the covid19 

pandemic continues to unfold we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions  

for our business many of our 

employees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our nonessential workers  

who are able to work from home 

continue to do so an extended period of modified business practices  

and remote work arrangements could have a 

negative impact on employee morale strain our business continuity plans  

introduce operational risk including but 

not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to efficiently operate our  

business 

 

• 

significant changes in political conditions

 

significant changes in political conditions in markets in which  

we 

purchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to  

continue at least during the pendency of the 

pandemic including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures  

or other restrictions that limit or 

close our operating facilities restrict our employees’ ability to  

travel or perform necessary business functions or 

otherwise constrain the operations of our business partners suppliers or  

customers which may materially 

adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition  

and liquidity 

 

 

 

• 

potential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities

 

although in fiscal 2020 we entered into 

amendments to our material credit facilities to among other things  

extend the maturity dates and temporarily 

provide additional flexibility under certain covenants an extended negative  

impact of covid19 on our business 

results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity could  

impact our ability to meet our obligations 

under credit facilities or outstanding long term debt which contain  

maximum leverage ratios and customary 

representations warranties and affirmative covenants 

 

• 

volatility  

in the financial markets

 

volatility  

in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the 

availability and cost of credit to us 

 

• 

refocusing management resources to mitigate effects of covid19

 our management is focused on mitigating the 

effects of covid19 which has required and may continue to require for the duration of  

the pandemic a large 

investment of time and resources across the company and may delay certain strategic and other plans which could 

materially adversely affect our business 

 

• 

potential

 

increased costs associated with our selfinsured medical insurance programs 

we may incur significant 

employee health care costs under our selfinsurance medical insurance programs  

if a large number of our 

employees andor their covered family members become ill from covid19  

and 

 

• 

reputational risk associated with response to covid19

 

if we do not respond appropriately to the covid19 

pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate we could  

suffer damage to our reputation 

and our brands which could materially adversely affect our business 

 

the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below any of which could have a material 

adverse effect on us 

 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

 

we obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties with whom we generally do not have 

longterm contracts while there is typically more than one source of  

supply some key suppliers in the aggregate 

supply a significant portion of the products we sell  

in 2020 our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and  

our 

single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30  

and 4 respectively of our aggregate purchases  

because of our dependence upon such suppliers our operations are  

subject to the suppliers’ ability and willingness 

to supply products in the quantities that we require and the risks include delays  

caused by interruption in 

production based on conditions outside of our control including  

a supplier’s failure to comply with applicable 

government requirements which may result in product recalls andor  

cessation of sales or an interruption in the 

suppliers’ manufacturing capabilities in the event of any such  

interruption in supply we would need to identify and 

obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee  

that we would be able to obtain such 

alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all and an extended interruption  

in supply particularly of a 

high sales volume product could result in a significant disruption in our sales  

and operations as well as damage to 

our relationships with customers and our reputation  

 

our  

future  

growth  

especially  

for  

our  

technology  

and  

valueadded  

services  

segment  

is  

dependent  

upon  

our 

ability  

to  

develop  

or  

acquire  

and  

maintain  

and  

protect  

new  

products  

and  

technologies  

that  

achieve  

market 

acceptance with acceptable margins 

 

our future success  

depends on our ability  

to timely develop or  

obtain the right  

to sell competitive  

and innovative 

particularly  

for  

our  

technology  

and  

valueadded  

services  

segment  

products  

and  

services  

and  

to  

market  

them 

quickly and  

costeffectively  

our ability  

to anticipate  

customer needs  

and emerging  

trends and  

develop or  

acquire 

new products  

services and  

technologies at  

competitive prices  

requires significant  

resources including  

employees 

with the requisite skills experience  

and expertise particularly in our  

technology segment including dental practice 

management patient engagement and demand creation software solutions  

the failure to successfully address these 

challenges  

could  

materially  

disrupt  

our  

sales  

and  

operations  

additionally  

our  

software  

and  

eservices  

products 

like  

software  

products generally  

may  

contain  

undetected errors  

or  

bugs  

when introduced  

or  

as  

new  

versions  

are 

released any such defective  

software may result in  

increased expenses related to the  

software and could adversely 

affect  

our  

relationships  

with  

customers  

as  

well  

as  

our  

reputation  

while  

certain  

software  

and  

eservices  

that  

we 

 

 

develop are protected  

under patent law  

we rely primarily  

upon copyright trademark  

and trade secret  

laws as well 

as contractual and  

common law protections and  

confidentiality obligations we  

cannot provide assurance that  

such 

legal protections will be  

available adequate or enforceable in  

a timely manner to protect  

our software or eservices 

products 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves  

risks and may not result in the benefits and 

revenue growth we expect 

 

one of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and  

international markets in part through 

acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions  

and enter into joint ventures in the 

future such transactions require significant management attention  

may place significant demands on our 

operations information systems and financial resources and there  

is risk that one or more may not succeed we 

cannot be sure for example that we will achieve the benefits of revenue  

growth that we expect from these 

acquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional  

costs or expenses  

our ability to 

successfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends  

upon among other things the following 

 

•

 

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at  

acceptable prices 

•

 

our ability to consummate such transactions which could potentially  

be prohibited due to us or 

foreign antitrust regulations 

•

 

the liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on  

acceptable terms 

•

 

our ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or  

joint ventures 

•

 

our ability to retain recruit and incentivize the management of the companies  

we acquire and 

•

 

our ability to successfully integrate these companies’ operations services  

products and personnel with 

our culture management policies internal procedures working capital  

management financial and 

operational controls and strategies 

 

furthermore some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give  

rise to an obligation to make contingent 

payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments  

could have material adverse impacts on our 

financial results individually or in the aggregate 

 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to  

which we are a party may discourage 

third parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in  

our stockholders receiving a premium 

over the market price of their shares 

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may  

make it more difficult for a thirdparty to 

acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price  

that certain investors might be willing to pay 

in the future for shares of our common stock  

these provisions among other things require 

 

•

 

 

the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60 of the shares of common stock  

entitled to vote to 

approve a merger consolidation or a sale lease transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our 

assets and 

•

 

 

the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 23 of our common stock entitled  

to vote to i 

remove a director and ii to amend or repeal our bylaws with certain limited  

exceptions 

 

in addition certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated  

vesting of stock options and other 

awards upon termination without cause within two years following a change  

in control or grant the plan committee 

discretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control  

further certain agreements between us and our executive 

officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those  

executive officers are terminated 

without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within  

two years following a change in 

control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control  

or after the first public 

announcement of the pendency of the change in control

 

 

 

 

industry risks 

 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive  

including without limitation competition 

from thirdparty online commerce sites and consolidating and we may not  

be able to compete successfully  

 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our 

competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which  

could allow them to compete more 

successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships 

with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights  

to market particular products which we would 

then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their  

efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby 

eliminate or reduce our role in distribution industry consolidation among health  

care product distributors and 

manufacturers price competition product unavailability whether due to our inability to gain access to products or 

to interruptions in manufacturing supply or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition 

consolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care  

products which could have a material 

adverse effect on our margins and product availability we  

could be subject to charges and financial losses in the 

event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained  

in some of our contracts additionally 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged  

by electronic online commerce 

solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third  

parties will require us to costeffectively adapt 

to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business  

including with additional 

valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and  

our customers on a timely basis the 

emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and  

effectively respond to changes on a 

timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  

 

the repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the affordable care act  

could materially adversely 

affect our business 

 

the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and  

education reconciliation 

act each enacted in march 2010 as amended the “aca” greatly expanded  

health insurance coverage in the 

united states and has been the target of litigation and congressional reform efforts since its adoption  

the us 

supreme court in upholding the constitutionality of the aca and its  

individual mandate provision in 2012 

simultaneously limited aca provisions requiring medicaid expansion  

making such expansion a statebystate 

decision  

in 2017 the us congress effectively repealed the aca’s  

individual mandate provision by eliminating 

the financial penalty for noncompliance  

in the most recent aca litigation a federal appeals court found  

the 

individual mandate to be unconstitutional and returned the case to a lower federal  

court for consideration of 

whether the remainder of the aca could survive the excision of the individual  

mandate  

this decision was 

appealed to the us supreme court and a decision is expected soon  

any outcome of this case that changes the 

aca in addition to future legislation regulation guidance andor executive  

orders that do the same could have a 

significant impact on the us healthcare industry and our operations 

 

the health care industry is experiencing changes due to political economic and  

regulatory influences that could 

materially adversely affect our business 

 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing  

political economic and regulatory influences  

in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant  

changes 

driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other factors trends  

toward managed care collective 

purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and  

changes in 

reimbursements to customers including increased attention to valuebased payment  

arrangements as well as 

growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental  

officials both our profitability 

and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws  

and regulations reducing 

reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical supplies and devices  

andor medical treatments or services or 

changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined  

if we are unable to react effectively to 

these and other changes in the health care industry our business could be materially adversely affected  

 

 

 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks  

and the multitiered costing 

structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure  

which can vary by manufacturer andor 

product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more  

favorable prices for medical products than we are 

able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand  

as many large integrated health care providers 

and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms  

additionally 

the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions  

to entities or persons with whom we 

do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete  

effectively which could in turn 

negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar  

terms from manufacturers to 

access lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and to  

develop relationships with existing and 

emerging provider networks and gpos we cannot guarantee that such terms will  

be obtained or contracts executed  

 

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers  

could harm our business 

 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through third

party delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping 

rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating  

results similarly strikes 

or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating  

expenses to rise and materially adversely 

affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis  

 

macro economic and political risks 

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could  

materially adversely affect our results of 

operations and financial condition 

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy  

and the economic outlook of the 

united states europe asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely  

affect our results of operations 

and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things 

 

•

 

election results 

•

 

changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade including without  

limitation the united states

mexicocanada agreement usmca the euuk trade and cooperation agreement of december 

2020 and other international trade agreements 

•

 

greater restrictions on imports and exports 

•

 

supply chain disruptions due to social issues 

•

 

changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy 

•

 

tariffs and sanctions 

•

 

changes to the relationship between the united states and china 

•

 

sovereign debt levels 

•

 

the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived  

economic currency or 

budgetary crises or issues 

•

 

consumer confidence 

•

 

unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured  

and underinsured population 

•

 

changes in regulatory and tax regulations 

•

 

increases in interest rates 

•

 

availability of capital 

•

 

increases in fuel and energy costs 

•

 

the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase  

prices over time 

•

 

changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions 

•

 

increases in health care costs 

•

 

the threat or outbreak of war terrorism or public unrest and 

•

 

changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing development and  

investment in territories and 

countries where we do business  

 

 

 

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government 

spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending  

andor higher income or corporate 

taxes which could depress spending overall recessionary conditions and depressed  

levels of consumer and 

commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products 

and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale  

we generally sell products to 

customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and  

financial performance deteriorate or if 

they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not  

be able to or may delay payment to us 

likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment  

terms 

 

regulatory  

and litigation risks 

 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements  

could materially adversely affect our 

business 

 

the laws and regulations that govern our business and operations are  

subject to varying and evolving 

interpretations future changes additions and enforcement approaches  

including in light of political changes such 

as with respect to the new administration of president biden that  

affect our ability to comply  

for example 

president biden’s administration has authorized and encouraged a freeze on certain federal regulations  

that have 

been published but are not yet effective as well as a review of all federal regulations  

issued during president 

trump’s administration  

changes with respect to the applicable laws and regulations may  

require us to update or 

revise our operations services marketing practices and compliance programs  

and controls and may impose 

additional and unforeseen costs on us pose new or previously immaterial  

risks to us or may otherwise have a 

material adverse effect on our business  

there can be no assurance that current and future government  

regulations 

will not adversely affect our business and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities  

the form content or timing 

of regulatory actions and their impact on the health care industry and on  

our business and operations 

 

global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on  

product pricing  

in the united 

states in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs there has been  

increased scrutiny on drug 

pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president  

executive branch agencies 

and various states at the state level several states have adopted  

laws that require drug manufacturers to provide 

advance notice of certain price increases and to report information  

relating to those price increases while others 

have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug  

affordability boards or multipayer 

purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs  

at the federal level several related bills have been 

introduced and regulations proposed which if enacted or finalized  

respectively would impact drug pricing and 

related costs 

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect  

and report detailed information regarding 

certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as  

physicians dentists and teaching hospitals  

we or our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state transparency laws that address 

circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and  

some of these state laws as well as the 

federal law can be ambiguous  

we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain 

interactions between suppliers and their customers  

while we believe we have substantially compliant programs 

and controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements  

such compliance imposes additional costs on us 

and the requirements are sometimes ambiguous  

in the united states government actions to seek to increase 

healthrelated price transparency may also affect our business 

 

 

 

our business is subject to additional requirements under various local state  

federal and international laws and 

regulations applicable to the sale and distribution of and thirdparty  

payment for pharmaceuticals and medical 

devices human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products “hctp products”  

among the federal laws 

with which we must comply are the controlled substances act  

the us food drug and cosmetic act as 

amended “fdc act” the federal drug quality and security act including

require registration with the fda and the dea and various state agencies 

•

 

require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products 

•

 

require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious  

orders of controlled 

substances to the dea 

•

 

require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject  

us to inspection of our 

recall procedures and activities  

•

 

impose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical hctp product or  

medical device causes 

serious illness injury or death 

•

 

require manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers of prescription  

drugs to identify and 

trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed  

•

 

require the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and thirdparty  

logistics providers and  

•

 

mandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping storage  

and handling of prescription drugs 

and associated reporting requirements 

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of  

computer software and digital health 

products intended for use in health care settings  

the 21st century cures act the “cures act” signed into law on 

december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition  

to exclude certain software from 

fda regulation including certain clinical decision support software  

certain of our businesses involve the 

development and sale of software and related products to support physician  

and dental practice management and it 

is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine  

that one or more of our products is 

subject to regulation as a medical device which could subject us or one  

or more of our businesses to substantial 

additional requirements costs and potential enforcement actions or liabilities  

for noncompliance with respect to 

these products 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require  

us to meet various standards 

relating to among other things licensure or registration program eligibility procurement thirdparty 

reimbursement sales and marketing practices product integrity and  

supply tracking to product manufacturers 

product labeling personnel privacy and security of health or other personal  

information installation maintenance 

and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products  

the fda and dea as well as cms 

including with respect to complex medicare reimbursement requirements  

applicable to our specialty home medical 

supplies business have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement  

activities and in particular the dea 

has heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the united states  

our business is also subject to 

requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations  

affecting our operations abroad 

 

the failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations or new  

interpretations of existing laws and 

regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations  

could materially adversely affect our business  

the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable  

statutes and regulations as they now exist 

and as they may be modified could be material  

allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied 

with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses  

while we believe that we are substantially 

 

 

compliant with applicable laws and regulations and believe we have adequate  

compliance programs and controls in 

place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have  

not complied with these laws we are 

potentially subject to penalties including warning letters substantial civil and  

criminal penalties mandatory recall 

of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension  

or limitation of product sale and 

distribution  

if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance  

we could be required 

to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including  

fines and the loss of licenses  

noncompliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability  

to participate in important 

federal and state government health care programs such as medicare  

and medicaid and damage our reputation 

 

the eu medical device regulation may adversely affect our business  

 

the eu medical device regulation no 2017745 “eu mdr” was meant  

to become applicable three years after 

publication in may 2020 however on april 23 2020 to allow eea national authorities notified bodies 

manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the covid19  

pandemic the european 

council and parliament adopted regulation 2020561 postponing the date  

of application of the eu mdr by one 

year to may 2021  

the eu mdr significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory  

compliance requirements 

for the medical device industry as a whole  

once applicable the eu mdr will among other things 

 

•

 

strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance  

once they are 

available 

•

 

establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’  

responsibilities for the followup of the quality 

performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

•

 

improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain  

to the enduser or patient 

through a unique identification number 

•

 

set up a central database to provide patients healthcare professionals and  

the public with 

comprehensive information on products available in the eu  

•

 

strengthen rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices such as  

implants which may have to 

undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market and 

•

 

identify importers and distributors and medical device products through  

registration in a database 

eudamed not due until 2022 and after  

 

in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory 

requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the 

distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance  

medical devices that have 

been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may  

continue to be placed on the market 

until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier  

however requirements regarding the 

distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance  

have to be observed by 

manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

 

the modifications created by the eu mdr may have an impact on the  

way we design and manufacture products 

and the way we conduct our business in the european economic area 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care  

fraud or other laws and regulations we 

could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations  

which could materially 

adversely affect our business  

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar  

foreign health care fraud and abuse referral 

and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations  

some of these laws referred to as “false 

claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent  

claims for reimbursement to 

federal state and other health care payers and programs  

other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit 

soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral  

of a patient or ordering 

purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services  

that are 

paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs  

certain additional state and federal laws such 

as the federal physician selfreferral law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibit physicians and other 

health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician  

or family member has a 

 

 

financial relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services  

for example durable medical 

equipment and medical supplies unless an exception applies 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened  

enforcement activity over the past few 

years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who  

serve as whistleblowers by filing 

complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states  

under applicable false claims laws 

and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries  

penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be 

severe and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs  

including the loss of licenses and the 

ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could  

have a material adverse effect on our 

business  

also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  

regulatory or judicial authority in 

a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial  

defense and settlement 

expenses  

even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private  

relators could result in reputational 

harm and the incurring of substantial costs  

most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these  

state 

laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims  

act penalties as well as other fraud 

and abuse laws  

 

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns  

about 

financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians  

dentists and other health care providers 

on the other  

as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices  

as necessary to facilitate 

compliance 

 

in the eu the directive no 20191937 of 23 october 2019 

on the protection of persons who report breaches of 

union law

 

which organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers must be implemented by eu  

member states by 

december 17 2021 this directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches  

of certain eu laws in particular as 

regards public health the abovementioned directive no 200183 regulation  

no 7262004 or as regards data 

protection the gdpr the directive protects a wide range of people and  

includes former employees  

all private 

companies with 50 or more employees are required to create effective internal reporting  

channels 

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign 

operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery  

act german anticorruption laws 

and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal  

books and records which have been 

the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years  

our businesses are generally subject to 

numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial  

results including without limitation 

securities antitrust consumer protection and marketing laws and regulations 

 

in the eu both active and passive bribery are criminalized the eu council  

framework decision 2003568jha 

of 22 july 2003

 

on combating corruption in the private sector 

establishes more detailed rules on the liability of 

legal persons and deterrent sanctions however the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national  

level 

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other  

laws and regulations could result in 

significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of  

licenses and the ability to participate in 

federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse  

effect on our business  

we may 

determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees  

or enter into other arrangements to 

resolve such matters  

intentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could  

materially adversely 

affect our business 

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and  

abuse and other laws and 

regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls  

in place to ensure substantial 

compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our 

services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or  

interpretation of laws could have a 

material adverse effect on our business 

 

 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality  

of sensitive personal information or 

standards in electronic health records or transmissions we could  

be required to make significant changes to our 

products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities  

 

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management  

products and our specialty home medical 

supply business include electronic information technology systems that  

store and process personal health clinical 

financial and other sensitive information of individuals  

these information technology systems may be vulnerable 

to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which  

could require us to expend 

significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security  

concerns and could involve claims 

against us by private parties andor governmental agencies  

 

we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations 

that protect the privacy and security of personal information such as the  

hipaa the controlling the assault of 

nonsolicited pornography and marketing act the telephone protection and electronic protection act of 1991 

section 5 of the federal trade commission act the ccpa and the cpra that becomes effective on january 1 

2023  

laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually  

evolving and subject to 

potentially differing interpretations these requirements may not be harmonized  

may be interpreted and applied in 

a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict  

with other rules or our practices  

our 

businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us  

to breach of contract claims 

substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation  

and harm to our reputation  

also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability  

of our customers to obtain use or 

disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant  

additional costs to redesign our products to 

reflect these legal requirements which could have a material adverse  

effect on our operations 

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union  

have adopted the gdpr which 

increases privacy rights for individuals in europe or “data subjects”  

including individuals who are our customers 

suppliers and employees  

the gdpr extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers  

and data processors 

and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties  

on companies such as us that offer goods or 

services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by  

companies based outside of europe  

noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20  

million or 4 of global company revenues  

data subjects also have the right to seek compensation for damages  

eu member states may individually impose 

additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters  

such as employee personal data  

 

in the united states the ccpa which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents became 

effective january 1 2020  

the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections 

regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information  

of california residents  

compliance 

with the new obligations imposed by the ccpa depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply 

them and because the ccpa is relatively new  

and its implementing regulations were released in august of  

2020 

there remains some uncertainty about how the ccpa will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the 

regulators if we fail to comply with the ccpa or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the ccpa 

we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation  

any of which may negatively impact our 

reputation require us to expend significant resources and harm our business  

furthermore california voters 

approved the cpra on november 3 2020 which will amend and  

expand the ccpa including by providing 

consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information  

and creating a new state agency to 

enforce ccpa and cpra  

the cpra will come into effect on january 1 2023 applying to information collected 

by businesses on or after january 1 2022 

 

other states as well as the federal government have increasingly  

considered the adoption of similarly expansive 

personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance  

while we believe we have 

substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with  

the gdpr ccpa and cpra requirements 

our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs  

on us and we cannot predict whether the 

interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response  

to new requirements or interpretations of 

the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and 

manage patient medical or dental records  

these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and  

industry 

 

 

standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of 

the privacy and security of those records our products or services  

may be used as part of these customers’ 

comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their  

efforts to comply with applicable data 

privacy and security laws and contractual requirements  

perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products 

or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who  

use our products or services to comply 

with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements  

may not only cause us significant 

reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers  

andor governmental agencies and 

involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses  

and costs for remediation 

 

under the eu gdpr health data belong to the category of “sensitive data”  

and benefit from specific protections 

processing of such data is generally prohibited except for specific exceptions 

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of electronic  

health record “ehr” systems and other 

products linked to government supported incentive programs where  

the ehr systems must be certified as having 

certain capabilities designated in evolving standards such as those adopted  

by cms and by the office of the 

national coordinator for health information  

technology of hhs “onc”  

in order to maintain certification of 

our ehr products we must satisfy the changing governmental standards  

if any of our ehr systems do not meet 

these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive  

federal incentive payments we may 

be exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws  

including the false claims act  

while 

we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications  

and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and 

regulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls  

in place to ensure substantial compliance 

we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or resulting changes in our could 

have a material adverse effect on our business  

 

moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex  

reporting 

functionality  

although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve  

increased costs 

and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy  

applicable standards could have a material 

adverse effect on our business 

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the 

ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged  

information becomes 

increasingly important  

as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with 

an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

 

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities  

 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as 

foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives  

may be proposed that could materially 

adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not  

be materially 

adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives in addition tax  

laws and regulations are extremely 

complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our  

historical tax positions are sound and 

consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent  

there can be no assurance that our tax positions 

will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be  

successful in any such challenge 

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the 

event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

 

our business involves a risk of product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary 

course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant  

in cases as a result of our distribution of 

products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we 

could be subject to the potential risk of product liability intellectual property infringement or other claims relating 

to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities in addition  

as our privatelabel business continues 

to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate 

product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products 

is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply  

chain  

in addition some of the 

products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous  

materials the improper handling of such materials or 

 

 

accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us  

to liability or at least legal action that 

could harm our reputation  

 

general risks 

 

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our  

technology products and services could 

materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be  

materially adversely affected if 

such products services or systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted  

damaged by unforeseen 

events are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of  

time 

 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store customer 

product supplier and employee data to among other things 

 

•

 

maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and  

distribution of thousands of 

inventory items from numerous distribution centers 

•

 

receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

•

 

manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of  

customers 

•

 

process payments to suppliers and 

•

 

provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic  

medical or dental 

records including protected health information of their patients 

 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a  

cyberattack that bypasses our is security 

systems including thirdparty systems we rely on causing an is security breach  

may lead to a material disruption 

of our is business systems including thirdparty systems we rely on andor  

the loss of business information as 

well as claims against us by affected parties andor governmental agencies and involve  

fines and penalties costs 

for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses in addition  

we develop products and provide 

services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack  

that bypasses the is security systems of our 

products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security  

vulnerabilities in our products or services 

could also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm and actual  

or perceived vulnerabilities may lead 

to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies  

in particular certain of our practice 

management products and services purchased by health care providers such  

as physicians and dentists are used to 

store and manage patient medical or dental records  

these customers are subject to laws and regulations which 

require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our  

products may be used as part of these 

customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection  

with their efforts to comply with 

applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities  

in our products or services or the 

perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products  

to comply with applicable legal 

requirements may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business  

but may also lead to claims against us by 

our customers andor governmental agencies and involve damages fines and  

penalties costs for remediation and 

substantial defense and settlement expenses in addition a cyberattack  

on a thirdparty that we use to manage a 

portion of our information systems could result in the same effects  

additionally legislative or regulatory action 

related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement  

new technology products and services  

 

furthermore procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new  

is challenges and enhancing 

protections and conducting investigations and remediation may impose additional  

costs on us 

 

finally our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of is systems providers engaged by our customers such  

as 

internetbased services upon which our customers depend to access certain of  

our products  

 

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially  

adversely affect our business 

 

our global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the  

risks that our 

global operations are subject to include among other things  

 

•

 

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations 

•

 

difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products establishing channels of distribution and  

contract 

manufacturing in foreign markets 

 

 

•

 

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies including without limitation  

in connection with 

brexit 

•

 

uncertainties relating to the euuk trade and cooperation agreement of december 2020 including 

for example potential implementation problems such as border delays as  

well as potential changes to 

the uk regulatory scheme to replace eu requirements  

•

 

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables  

in foreign 

jurisdictions 

•

 

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the united states 

•

 

regulatory requirements including without limitation antibribery anticorruption and laws pertaining 

to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

•

 

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and importexport  

tariffs quotas 

sanctions or penalties 

•

 

limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual  

property 

•

 

unexpected regulatory legal economic and political changes in foreign markets 

•

 

changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment 

•

 

civil disturbances geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political  

or military coups and 

•

 

public health emergencies including covid19 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior  

management and our revenues and profitability 

depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as  

customers suppliers and manufacturers of 

the products that we distribute 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of  

members of our existing senior 

management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer the loss of the services of 

mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr 

bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for 

senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting  

and retaining key personnel additionally 

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to  

maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales 

personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we  

fail to maintain our existing relationships with 

such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the  

future our business may be materially 

adversely affected 

 

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely  

affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with  

respect to indebtedness will depend on 

our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing  

economic conditions and financial 

business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial  

markets may materially adversely affect 

the availability and cost of credit to us

as a result of the covid19 pandemic as previously announced we have  

temporarily suspended our share 

repurchase program in an effort to preserve cash and exercise caution in this uncertain  

period and due to certain 

restrictions related to financial covenants in our credit facilities 

 

during the fiscal quarter ended december 26 2020 we did not make any  

repurchases of our common stock  

the 

maximum number of shares that could be purchased under this program  

is determined at the end of each month 

based on the closing price of our common stock at that time  

the maximum number of shares that could be 

repurchased as of october 31 2020 november 28 2020 and december  

26 2020 were 3164694 3159724 and 

3056528 respectively 

 

dividend policy

 

 

we have not declared any cash or stock dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2020 or 2019  

we 

currently do not anticipate declaring any cash or stock dividends on our common  

stock in the foreseeable future  

we intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes including 

our share repurchase program  

any declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of  

directors and 

will depend upon the earnings financial condition capital requirements

recent developments 

 

covid19 pandemic  

 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has 

negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and 

disruption of global financial markets in response many countries implemented  

business closures and restrictions 

stayathome and social distancing ordinances and similar measures  

to combat the pandemic which significantly 

impacted global business and dramatically reduced demand for dental  

products and certain medical products 

beginning in the second quarter  

of 2020 demand increased in the second half of 2020 resulting  

in slight growth 

over the prior year driven by sales of ppe and covid19 related products 

 

our consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions  

made by us that affect among other things 

our goodwill longlived asset and definitelived intangible asset valuation  

inventory valuation equity investment 

valuation assessment of the annual effective tax rate valuation of deferred income  

taxes and income tax 

contingencies the allowance for doubtful accounts hedging activity vendor  

rebates measurement of 

compensation cost for certain sharebased performance awards and cash bonus  

plans and pension plan 

assumptions  

due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of  

covid19 our judgments 

regarding estimates and impairments could change in the future  

in addition the impact of covid19 had a 

material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows primarily in  

the second quarter of 

2020  

in the latter half of the second quarter dental and medical practices began to reopen worldwide and 

continued to do so during the second half of 2020  

however patient volumes have remained below precovid19 

levels and certain regions in the us and internationally are experiencing an  

increase in covid19 cases  

as such 

there is an ongoing risk that the covid19 pandemic may again materially  

adversely effect our business results of 

operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial  

condition and liquidity  

however the extent of the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

 

as part of a broadbased effort to support plans for the longterm health of our business  

and to strengthen our 

financial flexibility we implemented cost reduction measures that included certain reductions in payroll 

substantially decreased capital expenditures reduced corporate spending  

and eliminated certain nonstrategic 

targeted expenditures as our markets began to recover  

we substantially ended most of those temporary expense

reduction initiatives during the second half of 2020 

 

corporate transactions 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we sold an equity investment  

in hufriedy mfg co llc “hufriedy” a 

manufacturer of dental instruments and infection prevention solutions  

our investment was noncontrolling we 

were not involved in running the business and had no representation  

on the board of directors  

during the fourth 

quarter of 2019 we also sold certain other equity investments  

in the aggregate the sales of these investments 

resulted in a pretax gain in 2019 of approximately 2502 million and an aftertax  

gain of approximately 1868 

million  

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we received contingent proceeds of  

21 million from the 2019 sale of hu

friedy resulting in the recognition of an additional aftertax gain of 16  

million 

 

on february 7 2019 the “distribution date” we completed the separation  

the “separation” and subsequent 

merger of our animal health business the “henry schein animal health business”  

with direct vet marketing inc 

dba vets  

first choice “vets first choice” the “merger”  

this was accomplished by a series of transactions 

 

 

among us vets  

first choice covetrus inc fka hs spinco inc “covetrus” a  

wholly owned subsidiary of ours 

prior to the distribution date and hs merger sub inc a wholly owned subsidiary  

of covetrus “merger 

sub”  

in connection with the separation we contributed assigned  

and transferred to covetrus certain applicable 

assets liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating  

to the henry schein animal health 

business  

on the distribution date we received a taxfree distribution of 1120  

million from covetrus pursuant to 

certain debt financing incurred by covetrus  

on the distribution date and prior to the animal health spinoff 

covetrus issued shares of covetrus common stock to certain institutional  

accredited investors the “share sale 

investors” for 3611 million the “share sale”  

the proceeds of the share sale were paid to covetrus and 

distributed to us  

subsequent to the share sale we distributed on a pro rata basis  

all of the shares of the common 

stock of covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of  

business on january 17 2019 the 

“animal health spinoff”  

after the share sale and animal health spinoff merger sub consummated the 

merger whereby it merged with and into vets  

first choice with vets first choice surviving the merger as a 

wholly owned subsidiary of covetrus  

immediately following the consummation of the merger on a fully diluted 

basis i approximately 63 of the shares of covetrus common stock were a owned  

by our stockholders and the 

share sale investors and b held by certain employees of the henry schein  

animal health business in the form 

of certain equity awards and ii approximately 37 of the shares of covetrus  

common stock were a owned by 

stockholders of vets  

first choice immediately prior to the merger and b held by certain employees of vets first 

choice in the form of certain equity awards  

after the separation and the merger we no longer beneficially 

owned any shares of covetrus common stock and following the distribution  

date will not consolidate the 

financial results of covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting  

following the separation and the merger 

covetrus was an independent publicly traded company on the nasdaq global select  

market

industry overview

 

 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment  

this trend has benefited 

distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low  

prices  

it also has accelerated the 

growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying  

groups which in addition to 

their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors  

capable of providing 

specialized management information support  

we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential 

to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can  

enhance the efficiency and 

facilitation of practice management

 

 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies  

and transactions that we 

undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the 

health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends 

toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements

 

 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current  

economic environment and 

uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services

 

 

industry consolidation

 

 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented 

and diverse  

the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of  

relatively small offices to group practices 

or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large  

number of practitioners who have 

combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage  

large quantities of supplies 

in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health  

care practitioners 

has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid  

reliable and substantially complete 

order fulfillment  

the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically  

made by the 

practitioner or an administrative assistant  

supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more  

than 

one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

 

the trend of consolidation  

extends to our customer base  

health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to 

partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician 

hospital organizations  

in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups  

are made at a centralized or 

professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices

 

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly 

those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to  

combine with larger companies that can 

provide growth opportunities  

this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking  

to acquire 

companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide  

opportunities to serve a broader 

customer base

 

 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand  

our role as a provider of products and 

services to the health care industry  

this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement  

our 

existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and  

thus strengthen the acquired 

businesses

 

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned  

to capitalize on this trend as we believe we 

have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although  

there can be no assurances 

that we will be able to successfully accomplish this  

we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing 

infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision  

makers who do not reside in the office

based practitioner setting

 

 

 

 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible  

candidates for merger and joint 

venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand  

our role as a provider of products and 

services to the health care industry  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue  

any such 

opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued  

if additional transactions are entered into or 

consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there  

can be no assurance that the 

integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful  

in response to the covid19 

pandemic we had taken a range of actions to preserve cash including  

the temporary suspension of significant 

acquisition activity  

during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as global conditions  

improved we resumed our 

acquisition strategy 

 

aging population and other market influences  

 

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth  

due to the aging population 

increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology  

and testing new pharmacology treatments 

and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance 

coverage  

in addition the physician market continues to benefit from  

the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing 

from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2020 there were more than six and a half 

million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care  

and elder

care services  

by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to  

approximately 19 million  

the 

population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 36  

during the same time period

 

 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care  

services continue to increase in the 

united states  

we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by 

current and future operating economic and industry conditions  

the centers for medicare and medicaid services 

or cms  

published “national health expenditure projections 20192028”  

indicating that total national health care 

spending reached approximately 36 trillion in 2018 or 177 of the  

nation’s gross domestic product the 

benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united  

states  

health care spending is 

projected to reach approximately 62 trillion in 2028

of the nation’s projected gross 

domestic product

plans of restructuring

 

 

on july 9 2018 we committed to an initiative to rationalize our operations and  

provide expense 

efficiencies  

these actions allowed us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure  

and fund new initiatives 

to drive growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan  

this initiative resulted in the elimination of approximately 

4 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities 

 

on november 20 2019 we committed to a contemplated initiative intended  

to mitigate stranded costs associated 

with the animal health spinoff and to rationalize operations and to provide expense efficiencies  

these activities 

were originally expected to be completed by the end of 2020  

as a result of the business environment brought on 

by the covid19 pandemic we are continuing our restructuring activities  

into 2021 we are currently unable in 

good faith to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of  

amounts expected to be incurred in 

connection with these activities in 2021 both with respect to each major  

type of cost associated therewith and with 

respect to the total cost or an estimate of the amount or range of amounts  

that will result in future cash 

expenditures 

 

during the years ended december 26 2020 december 28 2019 and december  

29 2018 we recorded restructuring 

charges of 321 million 147 million and 544 million respectively

agreement with covetrus our net sales increased 14 including local  

currency growth of 15 09 increase in 

internally generated revenue and 06  

growth from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 01 related  

to 

foreign currency exchange  

sales for the year ended december 26 2020 benefited from sales of  

ppe and covid

19 related products of approximately 1298 million an increase of approximately  

208 versus the prior year  

future ppe and covid19 related product sales may be lower than what  

we have experienced in 2020 which were 

driven by rising positive covid19 cases and practices seeking to ensure  

adequate supply 

 

the 78 decrease in dental net sales for the year ended december  

26 2020 includes a decrease of 76 in local 

currencies 80 decrease in internally generated revenue  

partially offset by 04  

growth from acquisitions and a 

decrease of 02 related to foreign currency exchange  

the 76 decrease in local currency sales was due to 

decreases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 125  

all of which is attributable to a decrease in 

internally generated revenue and a decrease in dental consumable merchandise  

sales of 61 65 decrease in 

internally generated revenue  

partially offset by 04 growth from acquisitions  

the covid19 pandemic 

adversely impacted our dental business beginning in midmarch of 2020  

as many dental offices progressively 

closed or began seeing a limited number of patients resulting in a decrease  

of 412 in second quarter dental 

revenues versus the same period in the prior year  

however in the second half of the year ended december 26 

2020 our dental sales began to improve as dental practices resumed activities  

and patient traffic increased  

global 

dental sales for the year ended december 26 2020 benefited from sales of  

ppe and covid19 related products of 

approximately 491 million an increase of approximately 72 versus the  

prior year 

 

the 216 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december  

26 2020 includes an increase of 216 local 

currency growth 207 increase in internally generated revenue and 09  

growth from acquisitions  

the 

covid19 pandemic adversely impacted our medical business beginning in  

midmarch of 2020 but not as 

significantly as our dental business as the decrease in second quarter  

medical revenues was only 112 versus the 

same period in the prior year our medical business rebounded strongly in the second half of the year in part  

due to 

continued strong sales of ppe such as masks gowns and face shields  

and covid19 related products such as 

diagnostic test kits  

global medical sales for the year ended december 26 2020 benefited  

from sales of ppe and 

covid19 related products of approximately 807 million an  

increase of approximately 490 versus the prior 

year  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 02 decrease in technology and valueadded services net sales  

for the year ended december 26 2020 includes 

a decrease of 03 local currency growth 32 decrease in internally generated  

revenue partially offset by 29 

growth from acquisitions partially offset by an increase of 01 related to foreign  

currency exchange  

the closure 

of dental and medical offices beginning in midmarch of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic  

resulted in a 

decrease of 159 in second quarter technology and valueadded services  

revenues versus the same period in the 

prior year  

as dental and medical practice operations resumed in the second  

half of the year the trend for 

transactional software revenues improved as more patients visited practices  

worldwide 

 

although dental and medical practices continued to reopen globally  

in the second half of the year patient volumes 

remain below precovid19 levels  

as such there is an ongoing risk that the covid19 pandemic may  

again 

have a material adverse effect on our net sales in future periods

as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks  

throughout our 

industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies  

additionally we 

realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in  

our health care distribution 

segment  

these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of  

software products and 

services as well as certain financial services the software industry  

typically realizes higher gross margins to 

recover investments in research and development 

 

in connection with the completion of the animal health spinoff see 

note 2 – discontinued operations 

 

for 

additional details we entered into a transition services agreement with  

covetrus pursuant to which covetrus 

purchased certain products from us  

the agreement which ended in december 2020 provided that these products 

would be sold to covetrus at a markup that ranged from 3 to 6  

of our product cost to cover handling costs 

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next  

changes in 

the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have  

been the most significant drivers affecting 

our gross profit margin  

for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally  

at lower gross profit margins 

than other products  

conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher 

than average  

with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower 

gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross  

margin on sales to officebased practitioners 

who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

 

health care distribution gross profit decreased 2686 million or 99  

for the year ended december 26 2020 

compared to the prior year period due primarily to the covid19  

pandemic  

health care distribution gross profit 

margin decreased to 257 for the year ended december 26 2020 from 289 for the comparable  

prior year 

period  

the overall decrease in our health care distribution gross profit is  

attributable to a 2322 million decline in 

gross profit due to the decrease in the gross margin rates and a 483 million gross profit  

decrease in internally 

generated revenue partially offset by 119 million of additional gross profit from acquisitions  

gross profit 

margin was negatively affected by significant adjustments recorded for ppe inventory and covid19  

related 

products caused by volatility of pricing and demand experienced during the  

year which conditions may recur and 

adversely impact gross profit margins in future periods although we do not expect  

material inventory adjustments 

to continue into 2021  

during the year we continued to earn lower vendor rebates due to lower purchase volumes 

in our health care distribution segment which also contributes to the lower gross  

profit margin

the 1137 million decrease in selling general and administrative

income taxes

 

 

for the year ended december 28 2019 our effective tax rate was 234 compared to 200  

for the prior year 

period  

in 2019 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by state and foreign income  

taxes and interest 

expense  

in 2018 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a reduction in the estimate  

of our transition tax 

associated with the tax cuts and jobs act tax charges and credits associated with legal entity reorganizations 

outside the us and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense 

 

within our consolidated balance sheets transition tax of 99 million was included in “accrued taxes” for 2019

for 2019 and 2018 respectively 

 

net gain on sale of equity investments 

 

on october 1 2019 we sold an equity investment in hufriedy a manufacturer of dental instruments and infection 

prevention solutions  

our investment was noncontrolling we were not involved in  

running the business and had 

no representation on the board of directors  

 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we also sold certain other investments  

in the aggregate the sales of these 

investments resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 2502 million  

and an aftertax gain of approximately 

1868 million  

 

liquidity and capital resources  

 

our principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions purchases  

of additional noncontrolling 

interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs  

purchases of fixed assets and 

repurchases of common stock which have been temporarily suspended  

working capital requirements generally 

result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and  

payment terms for receivables and 

payables  

historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory 

forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the  

end of the year and have caused our working 

capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to  

the end of the first quarter of the following 

year 

 

the pandemic and the governmental responses to it had a material adverse  

effect on our cash flows in the second 

quarter of 2020  

in the latter half of the second quarter and continuing  

through yearend dental and medical 

practices began to reopen worldwide however patient volumes remain below precovid19 levels and certain 

regions in the us and internationally are experiencing an increase in covid19  

cases  

as such there is an 

ongoing risk that the covid19 pandemic may again have a material  

adverse effect on our cash flows in future 

periods and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and  

liquidity  

however the extent of 

the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

 

as part of a broadbased effort to support plans for the longterm health of our business  

and to strengthen our 

financial flexibility we implemented cost reduction measures that included certain reductions in payroll 

substantially decreased capital expenditures reduced corporate  

spending and the elimination of certain non

strategic targeted expenditures as our markets have begun to recover we ended most of those temporary expense

reduction initiatives during the second half of 2020  

as the covid19 pandemic continues to unfold we will 

continue to evaluate appropriate actions for the business 

 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt 

placements  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent  

on the continued demand of 

our customers for our products and services and access to products and  

services from our suppliers 

 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which  

is susceptible to fluctuations during the 

year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands  

inventory purchase activity is a function of 

sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory  

we anticipate 

future increases in our working capital requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months  

funding requirements are based on 

forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change  

consequently we may change 

our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets 

and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with  

sufficient liquidity to meet our currently 

foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs  

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

on february 7 2019 we completed the animal health spinoff  

on the distribution date we received a tax free 

distribution of 1120 million from covetrus which has been used to  

pay down our debt thereby generating 

additional debt capacity that can be used for general corporate purposes including  

share repurchases and mergers 

and acquisitions

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5935 million for the  

year ended december 26 2020 compared to 

8205 million for the prior year  

the net change of 2270 million was primarily attributable to lower net income 

and lower distributions from equity affiliates  

both resulting from the sale of our equity investment in hufriedy  

in 

the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased working capital requirements  

specifically an increase in inventories due 

to stocking of ppe and covid19 related products and an increase in accounts  

receivable due to higher sales 

volume  

these working capital increases were partially offset by greater growth  

in accounts payable and accrued 

expenses 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 1150 million for the year ended december 26 2020  

compared to 4223 

million for the prior year  

the net change of 3073 million was primarily due to decreased payments  

for equity 

investments and business acquisitions partially offset by decreased proceeds from  

sales of equity investments 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1818 million for the  

year ended december 26 2020 compared to 

3634 million for the prior year  

the net change of 1816 million was primarily 

due to increased net proceeds 

from bank borrowings and lower repurchases of our common stock  

partially offset by proceeds received during the 

prior year related to the animal health spinoff

revolving credit agreement 

 

on april 18 2017 we entered into a 750 million revolving credit  

agreement the “credit agreement” which 

matures in april 2022  

the interest rate is based on the usd libor  

plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at 

the end of each financial reporting quarter  

we expect the libor rate to be discontinued at some point 

during 2021 which will require an amendment to our debt agreements to  

reflect a new reference rate we do not 

expect the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in our debt agreements  

to have a material adverse effect on 

our financial position or to materially affect our interest expense  

the credit agreement also requires among other 

things that we maintain maximum leverage ratios additionally the credit agreement contains customary 

representations warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative  

covenants subject to 

negotiated exceptions on liens indebtedness significant corporate changes  

including mergers dispositions and 

certain restrictive agreements  

as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 we had no borrowings  

on this 

revolving credit facility  

as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 there  

were 95 million and 96 

million of letters of credit respectively provided to third parties under the credit facility 

 

on april 17 2020 we amended the credit agreement to among other  

things i modify the financial covenant 

from being based on total leverage ratio to net leverage ratio ii adjust  

the pricing grid to reflect the net leverage 

ratio calculation and iii increase the maximum maintenance leverage ratio  

through march 31 2021

facility  

we have the ability to 

borrow up to an additional 200 million from the original facility amount  

of 700 million under this credit facility 

on a revolving basis as needed subject to the terms and conditions of  

the credit agreement

borrowings under this facility will fluctuate based on our net leverage  

ratio  

at december 26 2020 the interest 

rate on this facility was 250  

the proceeds from this facility can be used for working capital requirements  

and 

general corporate purposes including but not limited to permitted refinancing

private placement facilities 

 

our private placement facilities with three insurance companies have a  

total facility amount of 1 billion and are 

available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon  

at the time of issuance from 

time to time through june 23 2023  

the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the  

lenders at a fixed 

rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at  

the time of issuance  

the term of each 

possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to  

15 years with an average life no longer than 12 

years  

the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used  

for general corporate purposes including 

working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness  

andor to fund potential acquisitions  

on june 29 2018 we amended and restated the above private placement  

facilities to among other things i permit 

the consummation of the animal health spinoff and ii provide for the issuance  

of notes in euros british pounds 

and australian dollars in addition to us dollars  

the agreements provide among other things that we maintain

us trade accounts receivable securitization 

 

we have a facility agreement with a bank as agent based on the securitization of our us trade accounts 

receivable that is structured as an assetbacked securitization program with pricing  

committed for up to three years  

our current facility which has a purchase limit of 350 million was scheduled to expire on april 29 2022  

on 

june 22 2020 the expiration date for this facility was extended to  

june 12 2023 and was amended to adjust certain 

covenant levels for 2020  

as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 the borrowings outstanding  

under this 

securitization facility were 00 million and 100 million respectively

borrowings under this facility was based on the assetbacked commercial  

paper rate of 022 plus 095 for a 

combined rate of 117  

at december 28 2019 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility  

was based on 

the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 190 plus 075 for a combined

our leases have remaining terms of less than one year to 16 years some  

of which may 

include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years  

as of december 26 2020 our rightofuse assets related to 

operating leases were 2888 million and our current and noncurrent operating  

lease liabilities were 647 million 

and 2387 million respectively 

 

stock repurchases 

 

from june 21 2004 through december 26 2020 we repurchased 36  

billion or 75563289 shares under our 

common stock repurchase programs with 2012 million available as of  

december 26 2020 for future common 

stock share repurchases  

 

on october 30 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  

up to an additional 400 million in 

shares of our common stock 

 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic as previously announced we have  

temporarily suspended our share 

repurchase program in an effort to preserve cash and exercise caution during this  

uncertain period and due to 

certain restrictions related to financial covenants in our credit facilities 

 

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

 

some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right  

at certain times to require us to acquire 

their ownership interest in those entities at fair value  

account standards codification “asc” 48010 is 

applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required  

to purchase all or a portion of the 

outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest  

holder under the terms of a put 

option contained in contractual agreements

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling  

interests subject to put options are adjusted at 

each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin  

capital  

future reductions in the 

carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to  

the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling 

interests at the time they were originally recorded  

the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests 

cannot go below the floor level  

these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per  

share 

 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash 

consideration if certain financial targets are met  

any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our 

consolidated statement of income  

for the years ended december 26 2020 and december 28 2019  

there were no 

 

 

material adjustments recorded in our consolidated statements of income  

relating to changes in estimated contingent 

purchase price liabilities 

 

on july 1 2018 we closed on a joint venture with internet brands  

a provider of web presence and online 

marketing software to create a newly formed entity henry schein one llc  

the joint venture includes henry 

schein practice solutions products and services as well as henry schein’s international dental practice 

management systems and the dental businesses of internet brands  

internet brands originally held a 26 

noncontrolling interest in henry schein one llc that is accounted  

for within stockholders’ equity as well as a 

freestanding and separately exercisable right to put its noncontrolling  

interest to henry schein inc for fair value 

following the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture  

beginning with the 

second anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture henry  

schein one began issuing a 

fixed number of additional interests to internet brands which increased  

internet brands interest to 27 effective 

july 1 2020  

henry schein one will continue issuing additional interests  

to internet brands annually through the 

fifth anniversary ultimately increasing internet brands’ ownership to approximately 336  

internet brands is also 

entitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests in the aggregate up  

to approximately 16 of the joint 

venture’s ownership if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth fifth and sixth operating 

years  

these additional shares are considered contingent consideration  

that are accounted for within stockholders’ 

equity however these shares will not be allocated any net income of henry schein one until the  

shares vest or are 

earned by internet brands  

a monte carlo simulation was utilized to value the additional contingent  

interests that 

are subject to operating targets  

key assumptions that were applied to derive the fair value of  

the contingent 

interests include an assumed equity value of henry schein one llc  

at its inception date a riskfree interest rate 

based on us treasury yields an assumed future dividend yield a riskadjusted  

discount rate applied to projected 

future cash flows an assumed equity volatility based on historical stock price  

returns of a group of guideline 

companies and an estimated correlation of annual cash flow returns to  

equity returns  

as a result of this transaction 

with internet brands we recorded 5676 million of noncontrolling  

interest within stockholders’ equity  

 

noncontrolling interests 

 

noncontrolling interests represent our less than 50 ownership interest  

in an acquired subsidiary our net income 

is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries net income that is attributable  

to noncontrolling interests 

 

unrecognized tax benefits  

 

as more fully disclosed in note 14 of “notes to consolidated financial  

statements” we cannot reasonably estimate 

the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits  

including accrued interest of 840 million 

as of december 26 2020  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to  

make estimates and judgments that affect the 

reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and  

related disclosures of contingent assets and 

liabilities  

we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on 

various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  

the combined results of 

which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values  

of assets and liabilities that are not readily 

apparent from other sources  

however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and 

uncertainties  

reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions  

judgments and estimates 

including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were  

to be applied 

 

our financial results for the year ended december 26 2020 were  

affected by certain estimates we made due to the 

adverse business environment brought on by the covid19 pandemic  

during the year ended december 26 2020 

we recorded incremental bad debt reserves of approximately 100  

million for our global dental business  

our 

stock compensation expense during the year ended december 26 2020  

was lower than in the years ended 

december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 due to our estimate that a lower amount  

of performance shares granted 

in 2018 2019 or 2020 would ultimately vest as a result of the lowerthannormal earnings  

in 2020  

additionally in 

the year ended december 26 2020 we recorded total impairment charges on intangible assets  

of approximately 

203 million  

although our selling general and administrative expenses  

for the year ended december 26 2020 

 

 

represent managements best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  

amounts our judgment could 

change in the future due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic  

effect of the covid19 

pandemic 

 

furthermore during the year ended december 26 2020 our gross profit  

margin was negatively affected by 

significant adjustments recorded for ppe inventory and covid19 related  

products reflecting changes in our 

estimates of net realizable value brought on by volatility of pricing and changes  

in demand experienced during the 

year such conditions may recur and adversely impact gross profit margins in future periods although we do not 

expect material inventory adjustments to continue into 2021  

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with the audit committee of 

the board of directors affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the  

preparation of our financial 

statements 

 

revenue recognition

 

 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products equipment health care distribution 

revenues software products and services and other sources technology  

and valueadded services revenues  

provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other  

contra revenue adjustments are included 

in the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely  

amount based upon historical data and 

estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are  

recognized 

 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point  

in time when control transfers to the 

customer  

such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped  

using thirdparty common carriers  

we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the 

customer because we have no postshipment obligations and this is when  

legal title and risks and rewards of 

ownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an  

enforceable right to payment  

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control  

transfers to the customer this occurs 

when the equipment is delivered  

such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily  

by 

equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal  

installation which is typically completed at 

the time of delivery our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer however 

in instances where we provide warranty labor services the warranty  

costs are accrued in accordance with asc 460 

“guarantees” 

 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when  

products are shipped to customers or made 

available electronically such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training 

due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer  

support for software including annual 

support andor training is generally recognized over time using time elapsed  

as the input method that best depicts 

the transfer of control to the customer  

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs  

and financial services is 

recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when  

the services are provided  

we apply the 

practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after  

the customer obtains control as 

fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract 

 

sales valueadd and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenueproducing  

activities are excluded from 

revenue 

 

certain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include  

multiple distinct performance obligations 

which are accounted for separately  

when we sell software products together with related services ie  

training 

and technical support we allocate revenue to software using the residual  

method using an estimate of the 

standalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered  

elements  

there are no cases where revenue is 

deferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price bundled arrangements that  

include elements that are not 

considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation  

service  

we allocate revenue for 

such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services if  

an observable selling price is not 

 

 

available ie we do not sell the goods or services separately we use one  

of  

the following techniques to estimate 

the standalone selling price  

adjusted market approach costplus approach or the residual  

method  

there is no 

specific hierarchy for the use of these methods but the estimated selling  

price reflects our best estimate of what the 

selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on  

a standalone basis taking into consideration 

the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer  

location and other market conditions 

 

accounts receivable 

 

accounts receivable are generally recognized when health care distribution  

and technology and valueadded 

services revenues are recognized  

in accordance with the “expected credit loss” model the carrying amount  

of 

accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects  

our best estimate of the amounts that will not 

be collected  

in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider  

many factors in estimating our 

reserve including types of customers and their credit worthiness experience  

and historical data adjusted for current 

conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts  

 

sales returns 

 

sales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount  

of expected returns and are recorded as refund 

liability within current liabilities we estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales 

return liability based on historical data for specific products adjusted  

as necessary for new products  

the 

allowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we  

record an inventory asset and a corresponding 

adjustment to cost of sales for any products that we expect to be returned  

 

inventories and reserves

 

 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at  

the lower of cost or market  

cost is determined by 

the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and  

high tech equipment  

in 

accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many  

factors including the condition and salability 

of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes  

in any of these or other factors expected 

to affect the value of inventory  

although we believe our judgments estimates andor  

assumptions related to 

inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such  

judgments estimates andor assumptions 

could materially affect our financial results 

 

acquisitions 

 

we account for business acquisitions and combinations under the acquisition method of accounting where the net 

assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at  

the acquisition date and our consolidated financial 

statements include their results of operations from that date  

any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair 

value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill  

the major classes of assets and liabilities that we 

generally allocate purchase price to excluding goodwill include identifiable  

intangible assets ie trademarks and 

trade names customer relationships and lists noncompete agreements and  

product development property plant 

and equipment deferred taxes and other current and longterm assets and  

liabilities  

the estimated fair value of 

identifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates judgments  

and assumptions derived from analysis of 

market conditions discount rates discounted cash flows customer  

retention rates and estimated useful lives  

some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional  

purchase price cash consideration 

if certain financial targets are met  

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value  

those 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well  

as contingent consideration where applicable 

our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement  

as a result during the measurement period we 

may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with  

the corresponding offset to goodwill 

within our consolidated balance sheets  

at the end of the measurement period or final determination  

of the values 

of such assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first  

any subsequent adjustments are recognized in 

our consolidated statements of operations  

 

 

 

goodwill  

 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment analysis at least  

once annually or if an event occurs or 

circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value  

of a reporting unit below its carrying 

value  

such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the  

fair value to the carrying value of 

reporting units  

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments global dental global medical  

and 

technology and valueadded services  

goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes  

of preparing 

our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis  

 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including  

the identification of reporting units 

assignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services  

to the reporting units and ultimately the 

determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of  

each reporting unit is calculated by applying 

the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with a market approach  

this analysis requires judgments 

including estimation of detailed future cash flows based on budget  

expectations and determination of comparable 

companies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each reporting  

unit the estimates used to calculate the 

fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results  

market conditions and other 

factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination  

of fair value and 

goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

 

supplier rebates 

 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized  

over the period they are earned  

the 

factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted  

inventory purchases and sales in 

conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide  

for increasing rebates based on either 

increased purchase or sales volume  

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions  

related to 

supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments  

estimates andor assumptions could 

materially affect our financial results 

 

longlived assets 

 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other definitelived intangibles  

are evaluated for impairment whenever 

events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  

of the assets may not be recoverable through 

the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such  

assets 

 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements  

trademarks trade names customer 

relationships and lists and product development  

for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses  

are 

only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted 

future cash flows  

we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the 

estimated fair value  

when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value  

although we 

believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating  

cash flows and determining fair value are 

reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor  

assumptions could materially affect such 

impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

during the year ended december 26 2020 we recorded total impairment charges  

on intangible assets of 

approximately 203 million nearly all of which was recorded in our  

technology and valueadded services segment  

 

stockbased compensation  

 

stockbased compensation represents the cost related to stockbased awards granted  

to employees and non

employee directors  

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of 

the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures as compensation  

expense on a straightline basis 

over the requisite service period  

our stockbased compensation expense is reflected in selling general  

and 

administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

 

stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors  

under the terms of our 2020 

stock incentive plan formerly known as the 2013 stock incentive plan  

and our 2015 nonemployee director 

 

 

stock incentive plan together the “plans”  

the plans are administered by the compensation committee of  

the 

board of directors  

equitybased awards are granted solely in the form of restricted  

stock units with the exception 

of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting  

contractual obligations 

 

grants of restricted stock units are stockbased awards granted to recipients with  

specified vesting provisions  

in 

the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered  

on or following satisfaction of vesting 

conditions  

we issue restricted stock units that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time 

primarily four year cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee  

director stock incentive 

plan which are primarily 12 month cliff vesting and restricted stock units that vest  

based on our achieving 

specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily three year cliff 

vesting 

 

with respect to timebased restricted stock units we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on  

our 

closing stock price  

with respect to performancebased restricted stock units the number of shares that ultimately 

vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured  

against specified targets over a 

specified period as determined by the compensation committee of  

the board of directors  

although there is no 

guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased  

restricted 

stock units based on our closing stock price at time of grant 

 

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted  

stock units targets for significant events 

including without limitation acquisitions divestitures new business ventures  

certain capital transactions 

including share repurchases restructuring costs if any certain litigation settlements or payments if any changes 

in tax rates in certain countries changes in accounting principles or in applicable  

laws or regulations and foreign 

exchange fluctuations  

over the performance period the number of shares of common  

stock that will ultimately 

vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward  

or downward based upon our 

estimation of achieving such performance targets  

the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients  

and the 

related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our  

actual performance metrics as defined 

under the plans 

 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions  

related to stockbased compensation are 

reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor  

assumptions could materially affect our 

financial results 

 

unrecognized tax  

benefits 

 

asc topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in 

accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance  

this topic prescribes a recognition threshold and 

a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement  

of tax positions taken or expected 

to be taken in a tax return  

for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely  

than not to be 

sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  

the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of 

benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate audit  

settlement  

in the normal course of 

business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing  

authorities  

such examinations may result in 

future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain  

tax positions taken in respect of certain 

tax matters

 item 7a  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us 

dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets  

we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using 

foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits  

these hedging activities provide 

only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks  

factors that could influence the effectiveness of 

our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging  

instruments and liquidity of the credit 

markets  

all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components  

of hedging programs and are 

entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated  

currency exposure  

we do not enter into such 

contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying  

our investments maintaining a 

strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

 

foreign currency agreements 

 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar  

and the value of certain underlying functional 

currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results  

fluctuations in 

exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses  

and retained 

earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars  

where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs 

using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting  

the impact of foreign currency exchange rate 

fluctuations on earnings  

we purchase shortterm ie generally 18 months or less foreign currency forward 

contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany  

loans due from our international 

subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign  

suppliers  

we do not hedge the translation of 

foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting  

exposure not an economic 

exposure  

a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar  

in 2020 compared to foreign currencies 

would have changed our 2020 reported net income attributable to henry  

schein inc by approximately 13 

million 

 

as of december 26 2020 we had forward foreign currency exchange  

agreements which expire through november 

16 2023 which include a marktomarket loss of 99 million as determined  

by quoted market prices included in 

the forward foreign currency exchange agreements henry schein inc  

had eurusd forward contracts notionally 

totaling an amount of approximately €200 million with a reported fair value  

of these contracts as a net liability of 

96 million  

a 5 increase in the value of the euro to the usd from december 26  

2020 with all other variables 

held constant would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these forward contracts  

by decreasing the 

value of these instruments by 119 million 

 

total  

return swaps 

 

on march 20 2020 we entered into a total return swap for the purpose  

of economically hedging our unfunded non

qualified supplemental retirement plan “serp” and our deferred compensation  

plan “dcp”  

this swap will 

offset changes in our serp and dcp liabilities  

at the inception the notional value of the investments in these 

plans was 434 million  

at december 26 2020 the notional value of the investments  

in these plans was 676 

million  

at december 26 2020 the financing rate for this swap was  

based on libor of 015 plus 038 for a 

combined rate of 053  

from march 20 2020 the effective date of the swap to december 26 2020 we have 

recorded a gain within the selling general and administrative line item  

in our consolidated statement of income of 

approximately 212 million net of transaction costs related to this undesignated  

swap for the year ended 

december 26 2020  

this gain was offset by the change in fair value adjustment in deferred compensation 

resulting in a neutral impact to our results of operations  

this swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis  

 

shortterm investments 

 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by 

monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are  

the counterparties to such financial 

instruments  

as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing 

numerous investment grade counterparties 

 

 

 

variable  

interest rate debt 

 

as of december 26 2020 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain  

of our revolving credit facilities and 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization 

 

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on april 18 2017  

and expires on april 18 2022 has an interest 

rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our  

leverage ratio at the end of each financial 

reporting quarter  

as of december 26 2020 there was 00 million outstanding under  

this revolving credit 

facility  

during the year ended december 26 2020 the average outstanding  

balance under this revolving credit 

facility was approximately 214 million  

based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving  

credit 

facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 

less than 01 million 

 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into  

on april 17 2013 and was scheduled to 

expire on april 29 2022 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked  

commercial paper rate  

on june 

22 2020 the expiration date for this facility was extended to june 12 2023  

as of december 26 2020 the 

commercial paper rate was 022 plus 095 for a combined rate of  

117 at december 26 2020 the 

outstanding balance was 00 million under this securitization facility  

during the year ended december 26 2020 

the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately  

923 million  

based upon our 

average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our 

interest expense thereunder would have increased by 02 million

controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

under the supervision and with the participation of management including  

our principal executive officer and 

principal financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 

procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as  

such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 

15d15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934  

as amended the “exchange act” based on 

this evaluation our management including our principal executive officer and principal  

financial officer 

concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 26  

2020 to ensure that all 

material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file  

or submit under the exchange act is 

accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely  

decisions regarding required disclosure and 

that all such information is recorded processed summarized and reported  

within the time periods specified in the 

sec’s rules and forms  

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

 

the combination of acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations undertaken  

during the quarter and carried 

over from prior quarters as well as changes to the operating methods of some  

of our internal controls over financial 

reporting due to the covid19 pandemic when considered in the aggregate  

represents a material change in our 

internal control over financial reporting  

 

during the quarter ended december 26 2020  

we completed the acquisition of a dental business in north america 

with approximate aggregate annual revenues of approximately 20  

million  

in addition postacquisition integration 

related activities continued for our global dental and north american  

medical businesses acquired during prior 

quarters representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately 370 million  

these acquisitions the majority 

of which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems have  

been included in our consolidated 

financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition  

 

all acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations involve necessary  

and appropriate changemanagement 

controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of  

our internal 

control over financial reporting 

 

in addition as a result of a combination of continued governmental imposed  

and company directed closures of 

some of our facilities due to the covid19 pandemic we have had  

to maintain a number of changes to the 

operating methods of some of our internal controls for example moving  

from manual signoffs and inperson 

meetings to electronic signoffs and electronic communications such as email and  

telephonic or video conference 

due to outofoffice working arrangements however the design of our internal control framework and objectives 

over financial reporting remains unchanged and we do not believe that  

these changes have materially affected or 

are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial  

reporting 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  

internal control over financial reporting

spinoff of henry schein animal health business 

  

on february 7 2019 the “distribution date” we completed the separation the “separation” and subsequent merger “merger” of our animal health business the “henry schein animal health business” with direct vet marketing inc dba vets first choice “vets first choice” this was accomplished by a series of transactions among us vets first choice covetrus inc fka hs spinco inc “covetrus” a wholly owned subsidiary of ours prior to the distribution date and hs merger sub inc a wholly owned subsidiary of covetrus “merger 

  

sub” in connection with the separation we contributed assigned and transferred to covetrus certain applicable assets liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating to the henry schein animal health business on the distribution date we received a taxfree distribution of 1120 million from covetrus pursuant to certain debt financing incurred by covetrus on the distribution date and prior to the animal health spinoff covetrus issued shares of covetrus common stock to certain institutional accredited investors the “share sale investors” for 3611 million the “share sale” the proceeds of the share sale were paid to covetrus and distributed to us subsequent to the share sale we distributed on a pro rata basis all of the shares of the common stock of covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on january 17 2019 the “animal health spinoff” after the share sale and animal health spinoff merger sub consummated the merger whereby it merged with and into vets first choice with vets first choice surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of covetrus immediately following the consummation of the merger on a fully diluted basis i approximately 63 of the shares of covetrus common stock were a owned by our stockholders and the share sale investors and b held by certain employees of the henry schein animal health business in the form of certain equity awards and ii approximately 37 of the shares of covetrus common stock were a owned by stockholders of vets first choice immediately prior to the merger and b held by certain employees of vets first choice in the form of certain equity awards after the separation and the merger we no longer beneficially owned any shares of covetrus common stock and following the distribution date will not consolidate the financial results of covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting following the separation and the merger covetrus was an independent publicly traded company on the nasdaq global select market 

  

in connection with the completion of the animal health spinoff we entered into a transition services agreement with covetrus under which we have agreed to provide certain transition services for up to twentyfour months in areas such as information technology finance and accounting human resources supply chain and real estate and facility services 

  

as a result of the separation the financial position and results of operations of the henry schein animal health business are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 

  

industry 

  

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

  

  

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

  

competition 

  

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

  

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the medical market are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

  

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd as well as a large number of dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy japan liechtenstein luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand poland portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand united arab emirates and the united kingdom 

  

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

markets served 

  

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2019 and 2029 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 11 between 2019 and 2039 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 22 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 7 between 2019 and 2029 and approximately 13 between 2019 and 2039 

  

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

  

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

  

in the medical market there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of 

  

vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

  

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

  

• timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures 

  

• timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers 

  

• timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers 

  

• timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technologyrelated products and services 

  

• changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs 

  

• supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals 

  

• changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market 

  

• costs of developing new applications and services 

  

• our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

  

• uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems 

  

• unexpected regulatory actions or government regulation generally 

  

• exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers 

  

• loss of sales representatives 

  

• costs related to acquisitions andor integrations of technologies or businesses 

  

• costs associated with our selfinsured medical and dental insurance programs 

  

  

• general market and economic conditions as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries 

  

• our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships 

  

• unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products 

  

• product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers 

  

• exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

  

• increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers 

  

• fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 

  

• restructuring costs 

  

• the adoption or repeal of legislation 

  

• changes in accounting principles and 

  

• litigation or regulatory judgments expenses or settlements 

  

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

  

operating security and licensure standards 

  

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

  

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products” 

  

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt certain state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

  

  

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

  

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements 

  

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the udi rule phased in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018 with a final set of requirements for low risk devices being reached on september 24 2022 which will complete the phase in the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations and subsequent fda guidance regarding the udi requirements provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses 

  

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements 

  

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling reporting recordkeeping and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea 

  

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers 

  

  

in the european union the eu medical device regulation no 2017745 “eu mdr” will apply as of may 26 2020 the eu mdr significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance medical devices that have been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier however requirements regarding the distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

  

furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions 

  

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

  

antitrust 

  

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages  

  

health care fraud 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22927 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 102522 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a 

  

commercial health insurer furthermore the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

  

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

  

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

  

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

health care reform 

  

the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

  

the health care reform law included a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that was to begin in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics the fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics was implemented in 2011 however subsequent federal laws had suspended the imposition of the medical device excise tax through december 31 2019 and the further consolidated appropriations act 2020 signed into law on december 20 2019 has permanently repealed the medical device excise tax the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented 

  

in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2019 the fifth circuit ruled that the 

  

mandate within the health care reform law requiring that people buy health insurance was unconstitutional through the ruling will likely be appealed the fifth circuit remanded the remainder of the case pertaining to the viability of the remainder of the health care reform law in the absence of the individual mandate to the district court of the northern district of texas any outcome of these cases that changes the health care reform law could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

  

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities amendments expanded the law to also require reporting effective january 1 2022 of payments or other transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives and this new requirement will be effective for data collected beginning in calendar year 2021 

  

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us 

  

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally consolidated three programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the first mips performance year was 2017 and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments that began january 1 2019 macra standards continue to evolve and represent a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this 

  

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

recently there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president and various states including that several related bills have been introduced at the federal level such legislation if enacted could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business 

  

  

regulated software electronic health records 

  

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings the 21st century cures act the “cures act” signed into law on december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from fda regulation including clinical decision support software that meets certain criteria on september 27 2019 the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which incorporated applicable cures act standards including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the fda as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

  

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities 

  

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers and employees the gdpr extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the storage use or other processing of the personal data the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data in the united states the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents and was signed into law on june 28 2018 became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information of california residents the california attorney general released proposed ccpa regulations on october 10 2019 and is required to adopt final regulations on or before july 1 2020 in addition to providing for enforcement by the california attorney general the ccpa also provides for a private right of action entities in violation of the ccpa may be liable for civil penalties other states as well as the federal government have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr and ccpa requirements our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records and our products may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

  

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists through medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology of the department of health and human services these standards have been subject to change 

  

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

  

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important for example on september 6 2017 the fda issued final guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

  

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care 

  

  

ecommerce 

  

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

  

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets 

  

international transactions 

  

in addition united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

  

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

  

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability additionally in this competitive market some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability 

  

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites 

  

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

  

we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

  

our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

  

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected 

  

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

  

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

  

• timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures 

• timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers 

• timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers 

• timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technologyrelated products and services 

• changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs 

• supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals 

• changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market 

• costs of developing new applications and services 

• our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems 

• unexpected regulatory actions or government regulation generally 

• exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers which may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers 

• loss of sales representatives 

• costs related to acquisitions andor integrations of technologies or businesses 

  

• costs associated with our selfinsured medical and dental insurance programs 

• general market and economic conditions as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries 

• our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships 

• unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products 

• product demand and availability or product recalls by manufacturers 

• exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

• increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers 

• fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 

• restructuring costs 

• the adoption or repeal of legislation 

• changes in accounting principles and 

• litigation or regulatory judgments expenses or settlements 

  

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

  

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which could in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and to develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

  

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

  

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

  

  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things 

  

• the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union generally referred to as brexit and any other similar referenda or actions by other european union member countries during 2019 approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the united kingdom and approximately 20 of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in europe overall including the uk 

  

• election results 

  

• changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade including without limitation the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca and other international trade agreements 

  

• greater restrictions on imports and exports 

  

• changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy 

  

• tariffs and sanctions 

  

• sovereign debt levels 

  

• the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues 

  

• consumer confidence 

  

• unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population 

  

• changes in regulatory and tax regulations including without limitation the tax act 

  

• increases in interest rates 

  

• availability of capital 

  

• increases in fuel and energy costs 

  

• the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time 

  

• changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions 

  

• increases in health care costs 

  

• the threat or outbreak of war terrorism or public unrest and 

  

• changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing development and investment in territories and countries where we do business 

  

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall 

  

  

recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including but not limited to 

  

• the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community 

  

• changes in our industry and competitors 

  

• changes in government or legislation 

  

• our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and prospects 

  

• stock repurchases 

  

• any future issuances of our common stock which may include primary offerings for cash stock splits issuances in connection with business acquisitions issuances of restricted stockunits and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time 

  

• general market and economic conditions and 

  

• any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business 

  

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action or derivative litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other things trends toward managed care consolidation 

  

of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

  

the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

  

the health care reform law contained many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid which included a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that was to begin in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics the fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics was implemented in 2011 and may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold however subsequent federal laws had suspended the imposition of the medical device excise tax through december 31 2019 and the further consolidated appropriations act 2020 signed into law on december 20 2019 has permanently repealed the medical device excise tax the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance 

  

the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented 

  

in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax act which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2019 the fifth circuit ruled that the mandate within the health care reform law requiring that people buy health insurance was unconstitutional though the ruling will likely be appealed the fifth circuit remanded the remainder of the case pertaining to the viability of the health care reform law in the absence of the individual mandate to the district court of the northern district of texas any outcome of these cases that changes the health care reform law could have a significant impact on the us health care industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

  

recently there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president and various states including that several related bills have been introduced at the federal level such legislation if enacted could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business 

  

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

  

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes 

  

information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities amendments expanded the law to also require reporting effective january 1 2022 of payments or other transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives and this new requirement will be effective for data collected beginning in calendar year 2021 

  

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us 

  

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business 

  

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the fdc act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

  

• regulate the storage and distribution labeling packaging handling reporting record keeping introduction manufacturing and marketing of drugs hctp products and medical devices 

  

• subject us to inspection by the fda and the dea 

  

• regulate the storage transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials 

  

• require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable fda requirements 

  

• require registration with the fda and the dea and various state agencies 

  

• require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products 

  

• require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the dea 

  

• require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities and 

  

• impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical hctp product or medical device causes serious illness injury or death 

  

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations 

  

abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities and in particular the dea has increased generally its regulatory and enforcement activities due to the widely reported opioid crisis in the united states 

  

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

  

the eu medical device regulation may adversely affect our business 

  

as of may 26 2020 the european union medical device regulation no 2017745 the “eu mdr” applies to medical devices developed andor commercialized in the european union the eu mdr is anticipated to have a major impact on the medical device industry as a whole it may adversely affect our business in various ways 

  

first to the extent new products require a conformity assessment and such conformity assessment requires involvement of a notified body the current and persisting significant shortage of notified bodies may limit our options to seek certification andor significantly delay certification furthermore the few existing notified bodies designated under the eu mdr are experiencing significant capacity bottlenecks which leads to aboveaverage timelines for product certifications the same applies to timelines for recertification of our existing products for which the ce certificate is approaching expiry this may result in us not being able to launch or to continue commercializing products 

  

furthermore within the context of conformity assessment both for selfcertified devices and for devices under conformity assessment with a notified body the eu mdr is tightening the requirements for clinical evaluation of a device in the specific case of class i products where to date the legal manufacturer confirmed compliance with the regulatory requirements oversight by supervisory authorities is expected to increase and such authorities may have a stricter view it may be that from a perspective of the legal manufacturer or of an authority the existing product documentation has to be expanded which may require additional development work we may also have to decide to discontinue commercialization of certain products if and to the extent investments into additional development are not commensurate with the business contribution of such products 

  

additionally in the context of conformity assessment certain national authorities as well as the european commission have further scrutinized the business model of own brand labeling private label products under the eu mdr ie the reliance of a manufacturer distributing a product under its name on an assessment of a supplier confirming that the product meets the regulatory requirements including its technical files for the supplied product while this question remains under intense discussion between the industry and the authorities and while we are exploring all options this may require us to adapt the supply chain structure eg by switching suppliers or moving to a distribution business model under which the supplier of a product is labeled as the legal manufacturer for certain of our products and may make it more difficult to bring private label products to market in europe we may not be able to continue commercializing products if no alternative supply chain solution is found 

  

in addition the eu mdr is imposing more stringent regulatory requirements across the whole value chain including post marketing requirements additional requirements for the organization of the quality management 

  

system such as a responsible person for regulatory compliance post marketing safety reporting the requirement of unique device identification udi and the input into a european databank on medical devices eudamed which however is delayed in its operations with unknown implications on the regulatory obligations for product owners and distributors also the regulatory requirements for our interactions with suppliers and distributors alike are tightened these additional regulatory requirements increase our compliance obligations and thus the risk for noncompliance and greater costs 

  

the uncertain impact of the new eu mdr regulations as well as failure to comply with the eu mdr could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing related functionality 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22927 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 100522 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer furthermore the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

  

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

  

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation 

  

securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters for example one of our subsidiaries resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software which resulted in a consent order and fine failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities 

  

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings the cures act signed into law on december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from fda regulation including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria on september 27 2019 the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which incorporated applicable cures act standards including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulations by the fda as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is subject to regulation as a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

  

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as hipaa hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

  

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted the gdpr effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers and employees the gdpr extended the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the storage use or other processing of the personal data the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data in the united states the ccpa which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents and was signed into law on june 28 2018 became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information of california residents the california attorney general released proposed ccpa regulations on october 10 2019 and is required to adopt final regulations on or before july 1 2020 in addition to providing for enforcement by the california attorney general the ccpa also provides for a private right of action entities in violation of the ccpa may be liable for civil penalties other states as well as the federal government have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws backed by significant civil penalties for noncompliance while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr and ccpa requirements our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records and our products or services may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

  

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists though medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and by the onc these standards have been subject to change 

  

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy the 

  

changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important for example on september 6 2017 the fda issued final guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

  

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care 

  

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business 

  

global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things 

  

• difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations 

  

• difficulties in establishing channels of distribution 

  

• fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies including without limitation in connection with brexit 

  

• longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions 

  

• repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the united states 

  

• regulatory requirements 

  

• antibribery anticorruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

  

• unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products 

  

• imposition of importexport tariffs quotas sanctions or penalties 

  

• difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets 

  

• limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property 

  

• unexpected regulatory legal economic and political changes in foreign markets 

  

  

• changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment 

  

• civil disturbances geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coups and 

  

• public health emergencies including the coronavirus as defined below 

  

the coronavirus could materially adversely affect our results 

  

the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 “coronavirus” is impacting worldwide economic activity and activity in china in particular estimates for chinese gross domestic product and economic growth have been reduced as a result of the coronavirus the company has several businesses in china that were forced to close as a result of the coronavirus for certain periods with a corresponding effect on their sales activity in addition it is unclear if the coronavirus will spread to other countries and how economic activity might be impacted on a worldwide basis the company also might be unable to obtain infection control products from its suppliers due to the additional demand for such products created by the virus the impact of the virus on chinese and other economic activity and its effect on the supply chain are uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

we operate within the european union including in the united kingdom and therefore may be affected by the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union 

  

we operate within the european union including the united kingdom and as a result we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may lead up to and follow brexit including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the uk brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets during 2019 approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the united kingdom and approximately 20 of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in europe overall including the uk there is significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the uk will continue a relationship with the eu it is possible that brexit will result in our uk and eu operations becoming subject to materially different and potentially conflicting laws regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices furthermore in the event the uk and the eu do not reach a trade agreement during a prescribed transition period there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the uk and the eu or countries outside the eu such impacts could materially adversely affect our business the ultimate effects of brexit on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the uk and the eu reach to provide access to each other’s respective markets 

  

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

  

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

  

• may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures 

  

• requires significant management attention 

  

• may place significant demands on our operations information systems and financial resources and 

  

  

• results in additional acquisition and integration expenses 

  

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

  

• the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices 

  

• our ability to consummate such transactions which could potentially be prohibited due to us or foreign antitrust regulations 

  

• the availability of financing on acceptable terms in the case of nonstock transactions 

  

• the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets and 

  

• our ability to retain recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire 

  

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

  

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

if the animal health spinoff or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the animal health spinoff are determined to be taxable in whole or in part we and our stockholders may incur substantial tax liabilities 

  

in connection with the animal health spinoff we obtained an opinion of outside tax counsel that the animal health spinoff will qualify as a taxfree transaction to us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes we have not sought or obtained a ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” on the tax consequences of the transaction in addition the tax opinion is subject to customary qualifications and assumptions and is based on factual representations and undertakings the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects or any undertakings to be fully complied with could affect the validity of the tax opinion moreover an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the tax opinion even if the animal health spinoff otherwise qualified as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes it may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either us or covetrus while covetrus has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transaction not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement the potential tax liabilities could have an adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled if the animal health spinoff or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the animal health spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our us stockholders who participated in the animal health spinoff could incur substantial us federal income tax liabilities there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to indemnification or that covetrus would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify us for any such taxable gain in addition we andor our stockholders who participated in the animal health spinoff could incur tax costs in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the transaction irrespective of whether the animal health spinoff qualifies as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes 

  

  

the animal health spinoff may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks and liabilities 

  

we completed the animal health spinoff on february 7 2019 we undertook the transaction because among other things we believed that our animal health business could achieve greater growth by combining with vets first choice and that we could benefit from greater strategic focus of our resources and management efforts we may not benefit as expected from the increased focus on our core business strategic programs and objectives made possible by the animal health spinoff in addition the value of the transaction may be reduced by potential liabilities related to postclosing adjustments and indemnities which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

  

our business involves a risk of product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities additionally as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

  

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

  

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

  

• the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs 

  

• our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements and 

  

• our ability to provide ongoing technical support 

  

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark 

  

and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

  

we rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products 

  

some of our products contain technologically advanced components including software that are developed by third parties we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated 

  

in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell 

  

further the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components software andor other intellectual property into the products we sell also individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us

industry overview 

  

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

  

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

  

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

  

industry consolidation 

  

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

  

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

  

  

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

  

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

  

aging population and other market influences 

  

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

  

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2019 there were more than six and a half million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 41 during the same time period 

  

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20182027” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 36 trillion in 2018 or 177 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 60 trillion in 2027 approximately 194 of the nation’s projected gross domestic product 

  

government 

  

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust antibribery and antikickback customer interaction transparency data privacy data security and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

health care reform 

  

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

  

  

the health care reform law included a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that was to begin in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics the fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics was implemented in 2011 however subsequent federal laws had suspended the imposition of the medical device excise tax through december 31 2019 and the further consolidated appropriations act 2020 signed into law on december 20 2019 has permanently repealed the medical device excise tax the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented 

  

in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2019 the fifth circuit ruled that the mandate within the health care reform law requiring that people buy health insurance was unconstitutional though the ruling will likely be appealed the fifth circuit remanded the remainder of the case pertaining to the viability of the remainder of the health care reform law in the absence of the individual mandate to the district court of the northern district of texas any outcome of these cases that changes the health care reform law could have a significant impact on the us health care industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

  

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities amendments expanded the law to also require reporting effective january 1 2022 of payments or other transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives and this new requirement will be effective for data collected beginning in calendar year 2021 

  

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us 

  

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally consolidated three programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” program into a single program in which medicare 

  

reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the first mips performance year was 2017 and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments that began january 1 2019 macra standards continue to evolve and represent a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this 

  

recently there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by congress the president and various states including that several related bills have been introduced at the federal level such legislation if enacted could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business 

  

health care fraud 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22927 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 102522 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer furthermore the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

  

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

  

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

  

  

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

operating security and licensure standards 

  

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

  

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products” 

  

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt certain state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

  

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

  

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements 

  

  

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the udi rule phased in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018 with a final set of requirements for lowrisk devices being reached on september 24 2022 which will complete the phase in the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations and subsequent fda guidance regarding the udi requirements provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses 

  

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements 

  

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling reporting record keeping and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea 

  

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

  

in the european union the eu medical device regulation no 2017745 “eu mdr” will apply as of may 26 2020 the eu mdr significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole in particular the eu mdr imposes stricter requirements for confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems and for the distribution marketing and sale of medical devices including postmarket surveillance medical devices that have been assessed andor certified under the eu medical device directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 or until the expiry of their certificates if applicable and earlier however requirements regarding the distribution marketing and sale including quality systems and postmarket surveillance 

  

are required to be observed by manufacturers importers and distributors as of the application date 

  

furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions 

  

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

  

antitrust 

  

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages 

  

regulated software electronic health records 

  

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings the 21 st century cures act the “cures act” signed into law on december 13 2016 among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from fda regulation including clinical decision support software that meets certain criteria on september 27 2019 the fda issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products which incorporated applicable cures act standards including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the fda as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

  

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe “data subjects” including individuals who are our customers suppliers and employees the gdpr extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies such as us that offer goods or services to data subjects or monitor their behavior including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data with respect to the personal data it protects the gdpr requires among other things company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data breach notifications within 72 hours data integrity and security and fairness and transparency regarding the storage use or other processing of the personal data the gdpr also provides rights to data subjects relating to the modification erasure and transporting of the personal data in the united states the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which increases the privacy protections afforded california residents and was signed into law on june 28 2018 became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa generally requires companies such as us to institute additional protections regarding the collection use and disclosure of certain personal information of california residents the california attorney general released proposed ccpa regulations on october 10 2019 and is required to adopt final regulations on or before july 1 2020 in addition to providing for enforcement by the california attorney general the ccpa also provides for a private right of action entities in violation of the ccpa may be liable for substantial civil penalties other states as well as the federal government have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws also backed by substantial civil penalties for noncompliance while we 

  

believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr and ccpa requirements our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers and we are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” and the payment card industry data security standards which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records and our products may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

  

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists through medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability cost and improvement activities qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology of the department of health and human services “onc” these standards have been subject to change 

  

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

  

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important for example on september 6 2017 the fda issued final guidance to assist industry in 

  

identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device 

  

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care 

  

ecommerce 

  

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

  

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets

plans of restructuring 

  

on july 9 2018 we committed to an initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies these actions allowed us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and fund new initiatives that are expected to drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan this initiative resulted in the elimination of approximately 4 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities

as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

  

in connection with the completion of the animal health spinoff see note 2 for additional details we entered into a transition services agreement with covetrus pursuant to which covetrus purchases certain products from us the agreement provides that these products will be sold to covetrus at a markup that ranges from 3 to 6 of our product cost to cover handling costs we expect these sales to continue through august 2020 

  

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

  

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

  

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

  

  

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements

on february 7 2019 we completed the animal health spinoff on the distribution date we received a tax free distribution of 1120 million from covetrus which has been used to pay down our debt thereby generating additional debt capacity that can be used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 8205 million for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 4510 million for the prior year the net change of 3695 million was primarily attributable to an increase in net income decreases in working capital requirements and increased distributions from equity affiliates 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 4223 million for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 1643 million for the prior year the net change of 2580 million was primarily due to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions partially offset by increased proceeds of sales of equity investments 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 3634 million for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 4022 million for the prior year the net change of 388 million was primarily due to a distribution received related to the animal health spinoff proceeds from the animal health share sale a reduction in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and payments to the henry schein animal health business partially offset by increased repayments of debt related to the animal health spinoff and increased repurchases of our common stock

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

  

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

  

on july 1 2018 we closed on a joint venture with internet brands a provider of web presence and online marketing software to create a newly formed entity henry schein one llc the joint venture includes henry schein practice solutions products and services as well as henry schein’s international dental practice management systems and the dental businesses of internet brands internet brands holds a 26 noncontrolling interest in henry schein one llc that is accounted for within stockholders’ equity as well as a freestanding and separately exercisable right to put its noncontrolling interest to henry schein inc for fair value following the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture henry schein one will issue a fixed number of additional interests to internet brands through the fifth anniversary thereby increasing internet brands’ ownership by approximately 76 internet brands will also be entitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests in the aggregate up to approximately 16 of the joint venture’s ownership if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth fifth and sixth operating years these additional shares are considered contingent consideration that are accounted for within stockholders’ equity however these shares will not be allocated any net income of henry schein one until the shares vest or are earned by internet brands a monte carlo simulation was utilized to value the additional contingent interests that are subject to operating targets key assumptions that were applied to derive the fair value of the contingent interests include an assumed equity value of henry schein one llc at its inception date a riskfree interest rate based on us treasury yields an assumed future dividend yield a riskadjusted discount rate applied to projected future cash flows an assumed equity volatility based on historical stock price returns of a group of guideline companies and an estimated correlation of annual cash flow returns to equity returns as a result of this transaction with internet brands we recorded 5676 million of noncontrolling interest within stockholders’ equity 

  

  

noncontrolling interests 

  

noncontrolling interests represent our less than 50 ownership interest in an acquired subsidiary our net income is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests 

  

unrecognized tax benefits 

  

as more fully disclosed in note 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 1091 million as of december 28 2019 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

on december 31 2017 we adopted asc 606 “topic 606” using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of the adoption date results for reporting periods beginning after december 30 2017 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods our revenue recognition accounting policies applied prior to adoption of topic 606 are outlined in the financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 30 2017 the disclosures included herein reflect our accounting policies under topic 606 

  

we generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products equipment health care distribution revenues software products and services and other sources technology and valueadded services revenues provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are included in the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely amount based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

  

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the customer because we have no postshipment obligations and this is when legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an enforceable right to payment 

  

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control transfers to the customer this occurs when the equipment is delivered such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer however in instances where we provide warranty labor services the warranty costs are accrued in accordance with asc 460 “guarantees” 

  

  

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers or made available electronically such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer 

  

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided we apply the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the customer obtains control as fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract 

  

sales valueadd and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue 

  

certain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include multiple distinct performance obligations which are accounted for separately when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to software using the residual method using an estimate of the standalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price bundled arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services if an observable selling price is not available ie we do not sell the goods or services separately we use one of the following techniques to estimate the standalone selling price adjusted market approach costplus approach or the residual method there is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods but the estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions 

  

contract balances 

  

contract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheet when either we have transferred goods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us under the contract these contract balances include accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities 

  

accounts receivable 

  

accounts receivable are generally recognized when heath care distribution and technology and valueadded services revenues are recognized the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability 

  

contract assets 

  

contract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date and generally represent amounts owed to us by customers but not yet billed contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional the contract assets primarily relate to our bundled arrangements for the sale of equipment and consumables and sales of term software licenses current contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other and the noncurrent contract assets are included in investments and other within our consolidated balance sheet 

  

  

contract liabilities 

  

contract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and upfront payments for service arrangements provided over time that are accounted for as deferred revenue amounts contract liabilities are transferred to revenue once the performance obligation has been satisfied current contract liabilities are included in accrued expenses other and the noncurrent contract liabilities are included in other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 

  

deferred commissions 

  

sales commissions earned by our sales force that relate to long term arrangements are capitalized as costs to obtain a contract when the costs incurred are incremental and are expected to be recovered deferred sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period we apply the practical expedient related to the capitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract and recognize such costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we would have recognized is one year or less 

  

sales returns 

  

sales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount of expected returns and are recorded as refund liability within current liabilities we estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales return liability based on historical data for specific products adjusted as necessary for new products the allowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record an inventory asset and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for any goods or services that we expect to be returned 

  

inventories and reserves 

  

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

  

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

acquisitions 

  

we account for business acquisitions and combinations under the acquisition method of accounting where the net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the major classes of assets and liabilities that we generally allocate purchase price to excluding goodwill include identifiable intangible assets ie trademarks and trade names customer relationships and lists noncompete agreements and product development property plant and equipment deferred taxes and other current and longterm assets and liabilities the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates judgments and assumptions derived from analysis of market conditions discount rates discounted cash flows customer retention rates and estimated useful lives some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value those assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill within our consolidated balance sheets at the end of the measurement period or final determination of the values of such assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill is not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental and medical and technology and valueadded services goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis 

  

for the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 we tested goodwill for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter of each respective year using a quantitative analysis consisting of a twostep approach the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units including goodwill to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss if any that we would record for such reporting unit the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill 

  

our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections 

  

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

  

• significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

  

• significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business eg decision to divest a business or 

  

• significant negative industry or economic trends 

  

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill is impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

  

for the years ended december 28 2019 december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

  

supplier rebates 

  

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

longlived assets 

  

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets 

  

  

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer relationships and lists and product development for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

stockbased compensation represents the cost related to stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period our stockbased compensation expense is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

  

stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan as amended and our 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan together the “plans” the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors prior to march 2009 awards under the plans principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations 

  

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions we issue restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan which are primarily 12month cliff vesting and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting 

  

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant 

  

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets for significant events including without limitation acquisitions divestitures new business ventures certain capital transactions including share repurchases restructuring costs if any changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations foreign exchange fluctuations certain litigation related costs and material changes in income tax rates over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans 

  

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

  

unrecognized tax benefits 

  

asc topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance this topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect of certain tax matters

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

  

foreign currency agreements 

  

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie generally 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2019 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2019 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 60 million 

  

as of december 28 2019 we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through november 16 2023 which include a marktomarket loss of 39 million as determined by quoted market prices included in the forward foreign currency exchange agreements henry schein inc had eurusd forward contracts notionally totaling an amount of €200 million with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net liability of 03 million a 5 increase in the value of the euro to the usd from december 28 2019 with all other variables held constant would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these forward contracts by decreasing the value of these instruments by 120 million as of december 28 2019 henry schein inc had euro to brazilian real brl cross currency swap contracts notionally totaling an amount of €836 million with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net liability of 14 million a 5 increase in the value of the euro to the brl from december 28 2019 with all other variables held constant would have had a favorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by increasing the value of these instruments by 46 million 

  

shortterm investments 

  

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties 

  

variable interest rate debt 

  

as of december 28 2019 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization 

  

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on april 18 2017 and expires on april 18 2022 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 28 2019 there was 00 million outstanding under this revolving credit 

  

facility during the year ended december 28 2019 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 1475 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 04 million 

  

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and which expires on april 29 2022 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate as of december 28 2019 the commercial paper rate was 190 plus 075 for a combined rate of 265 at december 28 2019 the outstanding balance was 1000 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 28 2019 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 2748 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 07 million

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base

industry

 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

 

 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management

 

competition 

 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the medical market are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd as well as a large number of dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy japan liechtenstein luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand poland portugal singapore slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand united arab emirates and the united kingdom

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

business strategy

 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2018 and 2028 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2018 and 2038 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2018 and 2028 and approximately 14 between 2018 and 2038 

 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage

 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

 

in the medical market there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner

 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

governmental regulations

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018 with a final set of 

 

 

requirements for low risk devices being reached on september 24 2022 which will complete the phase in the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling reporting recordkeeping and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

 

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22363 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 100000 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer furthermore the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2016 the “health care reform law” significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

 

 

health care reform

 

the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a two year moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented 

 

in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2018 a texas federal court struck down the entire health care reform law a ruling which is being appealed and if upheld could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities effective january 1 2022 transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives must be reported

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally consolidated three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment 

 

 

modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” programs into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality promoting interoperability resource use clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the first mips performance year was 2017 and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings the 21st century cures act “cures act” signed into law on december 13 2016 amended the device definition to exclude certain software including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria in december 2017 the fda issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulation as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in europe “data subjects” or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance 

 

 

with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation

 

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists through medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability resource use clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” these standards have been subject to change 

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy the changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

 

 

 

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

ecommerce

 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

 item 1a risk factors

 

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority

 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability additionally in this competitive market some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability

 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products

 

we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock

 

our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute

 

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected

 

 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage

 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which could in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and to develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

 

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business

 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall 

 

recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including but not limited to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business

 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other things trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

 

the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business 

 

the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance 

 

 

the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax act which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2018 a texas federal court struck down the entire health care reform law a ruling which is being appealed and if upheld could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan

 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities effective january 1 2022 transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives must also be reported

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians dentists and teaching hospitals  we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us

 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products  and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the fdc act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing related functionality 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular 

 

 

states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22363 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 100000 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer furthermore the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of non‑compliance we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters for example one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software which resulted in a consent order and fine failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings the cures act signed into law on december 13 2016 amended the device definition to exclude certain software including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria in december 2017 the fda issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulations as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

 

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as hipaa hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted the gdpr effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe extended the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to data subjects or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation

 

 

 

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists though medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability resource use clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and onc these standards have been subject to change

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy the changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks

 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect

 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be materially adversely affected

 

 

 

if the animal health spinoff or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the animal health spinoff are determined to be taxable in whole or in part we and our stockholders may incur substantial tax liabilities

in connection with the animal health spinoff we obtained an opinion of outside tax counsel that the animal health spinoff will qualify as a taxfree transaction to us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes we have not sought or obtained a ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” on the tax consequences of the transaction in addition the tax opinion is subject to customary qualifications and assumptions and is based on factual representations and undertakings the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects or any undertakings to be fully complied with could affect the validity of the tax opinion moreover an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the tax opinion even if the animal health spinoff otherwise qualified as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes it may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either us or covetrus while covetrus has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transaction not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement the potential tax liabilities could have an adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled if the animal health spinoff or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the animal health spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we andor our us stockholders who participated in the animal health spinoff could incur substantial us federal income tax liabilities there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to indemnification or that covetrus would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify us for any such taxable gain in addition we andor our stockholders who participated in the animal health spinoff could incur tax costs in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the transaction irrespective of whether the animal health spinoff qualifies as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes

 

the animal health spinoff may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks and liabilities

 

we completed the animal health spinoff on february 7 2019 we undertook the transaction because among other things we believed that our animal health business could achieve greater growth by combining with vets first choice and that we could benefit from greater strategic focus of our resources and management efforts we may not benefit as expected from the increased focus on our core business strategic programs and objectives made possible by the animal health spinoff in addition the value of the transaction may be reduced by potential liabilities related to postclosing adjustments and indemnities which could adversely affect our results of operations

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury

 

our business involves a risk of product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities additionally as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with 

 

 

adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products

 

we rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products

 

some of our products contain technologically advanced components including software that are developed by third parties we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated 

 

in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell 

 

further the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components software andor other intellectual property into the products we sell also individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us

 

the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results and our reputation 

 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites

 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

 

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time

 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store data to among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems andor the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business

 

in addition we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies in particular certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers such as physicians and dentists are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses 

 

regarding direct customer claims although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases

 

in addition our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an is security breach additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services

 

risks associated with these and other is security breaches may include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we also deliver internetbased services and accordingly depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the internet in the event of any difficulties outages and delays by internet service providers we may be impeded from providing such services which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 2013 stock incentive plan and 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stockunit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control

 

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax act into law which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

industry overview

 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management

 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements

 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services

 

industry consolidation

 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our 

 

 

salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting

 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

 

aging population and other market influences 

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2018 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 50 during the same time period

 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20172026” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 37 trillion in 2018 or 182 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 57 trillion in 2026 approximately 197 of the nation’s gross domestic product

 

government

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust antibribery and antikickback customer interaction transparency data privacy data security and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

health care reform

 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 

 

 

2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented 

 

in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it including without limitation by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law further in december 2018 a texas federal court struck down the entire health care reform law a ruling which is being appealed and if upheld could have a significant impact on the us healthcare industry the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities effective january 1 2022 transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives must also be reported

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 established a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally consolidated three programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality promoting interoperability resource use clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the first mips performance year was 2017 and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are 

 

 

positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and who may receive up to 30 of total government recoveries penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe for example under the federal false claims act violations may result in treble damages plus civil penalties of up to 22363 per claim as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties with respect to “antikickback laws” violations of for example the federal antikickback law may result in civil penalties of up to 100000 for each violation plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties notably effective october 24 2018 a new federal antikickback law  the “eliminating kickbacks in recovery act of 2018” enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation  may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services regardless of whether the services at issue involved addition services and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer furthermore the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions clarifying that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

 

with respect to measures of this type the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

 

 

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and continues to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices most compliance dates were reached as of september 24 2018 with a final set of requirements for low risk devices being reach on september 24 2022 which will complete the phase in the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions 

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings the 21 st century cures act “cures act” signed into law on december 13 2016 amended the device definition to exclude certain software including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria in december 2017 the fca issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulation as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increased privacy rights for individuals in europe extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes 

 

 

increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in europe “data subjects” or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation

 

various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include among others programs that incentivize physicians and dentists through medicare’s mips to use certified ehr technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements including regarding quality promoting interoperability resource use clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information qualification for the mips incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” these standards have been subject to change

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to mips and other incentive programs in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy the changing governmental standards if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we are exposed to risk such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice 

 

 

management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial 

fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

ecommerce

 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

plans of restructuring

 

on july 9 2018 we committed to an initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies these actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and fund new initiatives that are expected to drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2  to 3  of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities the total 2018 costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring were initially expected to be in the range of 45 million to 55 million however additional cost savings opportunities were identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a charge of 354 million in the quarter which increased our full year 2018 restructuring charges to 629 million consisting primarily of severance costs 

 

we plan to continue restructuring activities in the first half of 2019 and expect to incur additional restructuring costs related to these activities during the first half of 2019 at this time we are identifying specific opportunities and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional restructuring costs in 2019

 

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 this initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities we subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement costsavings initiatives which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions representing slightly more than 4 of our workforce the total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included 349 million pretax which was recorded in fiscal 2015 and 459 million pretax which was recorded in fiscal 2016 

 

the costs associated with these restructurings are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income

gross profit increased 1960 million or 58 for the year ended december 29 2018 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies

income taxes

 

for the year ended december 29 2018 our effective tax rate was 224 compared to 441 for the prior year period in 2018 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a reduction in the estimate of our transition tax associated with the tax act tax charges and credits associated with legal entity reorganizations outside the us and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense in 2017 our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the tax act the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” no 201609 “stock compensation” topic 718 “asu 201609” as well as state and foreign income taxes and interest expense

on december 22 2017 the us government passed the tax act the tax act is comprehensive tax legislation that implemented complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 modification of accelerated depreciation the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest additionally the tax act moved from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime which requires us companies to pay a mandatory onetime transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the us the transition tax is payable over eight years the tax act also included provisions to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” a beneficial tax rate for eign derived intangible income “fdii” a base erosion and antiabuse tax “beat” that imposes tax on certain foreign relatedparty payments and irc section 163j interest limitation interest limitation we became subject to the gilti fdii beat and interest limitation provisions effective january 1 2018 

 

 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred we elected to recognize the tax on gilti as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred under topic 740 we estimated the impact of each provision of the tax act on our effective tax and recorded a current tax expense for the gilti provision of 75 million in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 29 2018 for the beat fdii and interest limitation computations we have not recorded an estimate in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 29 2018 because we have concluded that these provisions of the tax act will not apply to us or will have an immaterial impact in 2018

due to the complexities of the tax act the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” that allowed the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the tax act in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made in its 2017 financial statements sab 118 allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts   in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded provisional amounts related to the tax act for any items that could be reasonably estimated at the time this included the onetime transition tax that we estimated to be  1400 million and a net deferred tax expense of  30 million attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate of 21 within our consolidated balance sheets  274 million was included in “accrued taxes” and  1126 million was included in “other liabilities” in the aggregate for the quarter ended december 30 2017 these tax act modifications resulted in a onetime tax expense of approximately  1430 million absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities our effective tax rate for the year ended december 30 2017 would have been 267  as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 441 

for the year ended december 29 2018 we have recorded a net 100 million reduction to the onetime transition tax and an additional 17 million net deferred tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate within our consolidated balance sheets 99 million is included in “accrued taxes” and 1042 million is included in “other liabilities” for the transition tax the changes were a result of additional analysis changes in interpretation and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance that was issued as of december 29 2018 the company has completed its analysis of the impact of the tax act in accordance with sab 118 and the amounts are now considered final

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year

 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers

 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements

 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements

 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements

borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet

 

longterm debt

 

longterm debt consisted of the following

 

 

 

stock repurchases

 

from june 21 2004 through december 29 2018 we repurchased approximately 29 billion or 58189377 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 4000 million available as of december 29 2018 for future common stock share repurchases

 

 

 

noncontrolling interests

 

some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 29 2018 december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 are presented in the following table

 

 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share

 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income

 

during 2018 we entered into a joint venture with internet brands to create a newly formed entity henry schein one llc the joint venture includes henry schein practice solutions products and services as well as henry schein’s international dental practice management systems and the dental businesses of internet brands internet brands holds a 26 noncontrolling interest in henry schein one llc that is accounted for within stockholders’ equity as well as a freestanding and separately exercisable right to put its noncontrolling interest to henry schein inc for fair value following the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture henry schein one will issue a fixed number of additional interests to internet brands through the fifth anniversary thereby increasing internet brands’ ownership by approximately 76 internet brands will also be entitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests in the aggregate up to approximately 16 of the joint venture’s ownership if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth fifth and sixth operating years these additional shares are considered contingent consideration that are accounted for within stockholders’ equity however these shares will not be allocated any net income of henry schein one until the shares vest or are earned by internet brands as a result of this transaction with internet brands we recorded 5676 million of noncontrolling interest within stockholders’ equity reflecting certain fair value methodology 

 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 1000 million as of december 29 2018 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements

 

revenue recognition

 

on december 31 2017 we adopted asc 606 “topic 606” using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of the adoption date results for reporting periods beginning after december 30 2017 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods our revenue recognition accounting policies applied prior to adoption of topic 606 are outlined in the financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 30 2017 the disclosures included herein reflect our accounting policies under topic 606

 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and prior to the completion of the animal health spinoff animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are included in the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely amount based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized

 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the customer because we have no postshipment obligations and this is when legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an enforceable right to payment 

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control transfers to the customer this occurs when the equipment is delivered such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer however in instances where we provide warranty labor services the warranty costs are accrued in accordance with asc 460 “guarantees” 

 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers or made available electronically such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer 

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided we apply the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the customer obtains control as fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract

 

 

 

sales valueadd and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue

 

certain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include multiple distinct performance obligations which are accounted for separately when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to software using the residual method using an estimate of the standalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price bundled arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services if an observable selling price is not available ie we do not sell the goods or services separately we use one of the following techniques to estimate the standalone selling price adjusted market approach costplus approach or the residual method there is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods but the estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions 

 

accounts receivable

 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability 

 

contract assets 

 

contract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date and generally represent amounts owed to us by customers but not yet billed contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional current contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other and the noncurrent contract assets are included in investments and other within our consolidated balance sheet

 

contract liabilities

 

contract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and deferred revenue amounts contract liabilities are transferred to revenue once the performance obligation has been satisfied current contract liabilities are included in accrued expenses other and the noncurrent contract liabilities are included in other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet

 

deferred commissions 

 

sales commissions earned by our sales force that relate to long term arrangements are capitalized as costs to obtain a contract when the costs incurred are incremental and are expected to be recovered deferred sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period we apply the practical expedient related to the capitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract and recognize such costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we would have recognized is one year or less

 

sales returns 

 

sales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount of expected returns and are recorded as refund liability within current liabilities we estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales return liability based on historical data for specific products adjusted as necessary for new products the allowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record an inventory asset and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for any goods or services that we expect to be returned   

 

 

inventories and reserves

 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental medical and prior to the completion of the animal health spinoff animal health and technology and valueadded services goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis

 

for the years ended december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a twostep approach the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units including goodwill to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss if any that we would record for such reporting unit the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill 

 

our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections

 

our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable

 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include

 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

 

•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business eg decision to divest a business or 

 

•   significant negative industry or economic trends 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income

 

 

for the years ended december 29 2018 december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments

 

supplier rebates

 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

longlived assets

 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets

 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation represents the cost related to stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period our stockbased compensation expense is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income

 

stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan as amended and our 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan together the “plans” the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors prior to march 2009 awards under the plans principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations

 

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions we issue restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan which are primarily 12month cliff vesting and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting

 

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a 

 

 

specified period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant

 

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets for significant events including without limitation acquisitions divestitures new business ventures certain capital transactions including share repurchases restructuring costs if any changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations foreign exchange fluctuations certain litigation related costs and material changes in income tax rates over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans

 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

accounting standards update

 

for a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted or will be adopted in the future please refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8

 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital

 

foreign currency agreements

 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2018 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2018 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 80 million

 

as of december 29 2018 we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through november 27 2019 which include a fair value gain of 14 million as determined by quoted market prices as of december 29 2018 henry schein inc had euro to brazilian real brl cross currency swap contracts notionally totaling an amount of €946 million with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net asset of 94 million a 5 hypothetical change in the value of the euro to the brl from december 29 2018 with all other variables held constant would have had changed the value fair value of these swap contracts by approximately 53 million 

 

 

 

shortterm investments

 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

 

variable interest rate debt

 

as of december 29 2018 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization

 

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on april 18 2017 and expires on april 18 2022 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 29 2018 there was 1750 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility during the year ended december 29 2018 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 3938 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 10 million

 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and which expires on april 29 2020 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate as of december 29 2018 the commercial paper rate was 266 plus 075 for a combined rate of 341 at december 29 2018 the outstanding balance was 3500 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 29 2018 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 3490 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 09 million

industry

 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2017 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management

 

competition  

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental animal health and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level in the animal health market our primary competitors are the mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc our primary competitors in the medical market are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records 

 

 

 

market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services limited patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc centaur services limited mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic denmark france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy japan liechtenstein luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand united arab emirates and the united kingdom

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

 

 

business strategy

 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2017 and 2027 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2017 and 2037 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2017 and 2027 and approximately 15 between 2017 and 2037 

 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage

 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software

 

in the medical market there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner

 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

governmental regulations

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 subject to certain enforcement delays by the fda and will continue to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with 

 

 

 

a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses 

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as 

 

 

 

“false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with a final rule published by the department of justice on february 3 2017 which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after february 3 2017 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from a minimum perclaim penalty of 10781 to 10957 and from a maximum perclaim penalty of 21563 to 21916 most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

health care reform

 

the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics 

 

 

 

that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a two year moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act into law which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions the tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity the centers for medicine and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” programs into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk a final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and allows eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 a final rule updating certain quality payment program regulations was published on november 16 2017 which became effective as of january 1 2018 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increases privacy rights for individuals in europe extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in europe “data subjects” or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation

 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr 

 

 

 

technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” 

 

the use of certified ehr technology will continue as a feature of macra’s mips program and in connection with this medicare ehr program payment adjustments to eligible clinicians will sunset at the end of 2018 and mips payment adjustments will begin on january 1 2019 the first performance period for mips began january 1 2017 and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria made certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible hospitals

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs cms and onc establish criteria for certified ehr systems and these criteria have been subject to change in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws such as the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission 

 

 

 

standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

 

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

ecommerce

 

  electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

 

  through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets

 item 1a risk factors

 

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority

 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability additionally in this competitive market some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability

 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products

 

we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock

 

our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute

 

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage

  the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which could in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and to develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

  increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business  

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall 

 

recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including but not limited to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business

 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other things trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and in the case of animal health practitioners changes in the use of feed additives including without limitation antibiotics and growth promotants used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions animal welfare andor government regulations and changes in customer buying habits including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians’ offices if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

 

the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business 

 

the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers 

 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care 

 

 

 

reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the health care law on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act into law which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions the tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law also affects our ability to plan 

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 enacted on april 16 2015 “macra” establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through mips or apms mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare ehr program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk a final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and allows eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 a final rule updating certain quality payment program regulations was published on november 16 2017 which is effective as of january 1 2018 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals  we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products  and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality

 

the fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with a final rule published by the department of justice on february 3 2017 which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after february 3 2017 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from a minimum perclaim penalty of 10781 to 10957 and from a maximum perclaim penalty of 21563 to 21916 most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the german anticorruption law and other antibribery laws anticorruption laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of non‑compliance we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters for example one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software which resulted in a consent order and fine failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business

 

 

 

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as hipaa hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted the gdpr effective from may 25 2018 which increases privacy rights for individuals in europe extends the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to data subjects or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

 

 

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation

 

in addition federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr systems in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and onc in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs cms and onc establish criteria for certified ehr systems and these criteria have been subject to change in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws such as the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria making certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs 

 

 

 

through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible hospitals 

 

the use of certified ehr technology will continue as a feature of macra’s mips programs and in connection with this medicare ehr program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and mips payment adjustments will begin on january 1 2019 the first performance period for mips began january 1 2017 and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

 

there may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business

 

global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks

 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect

 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be materially adversely affected

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury

 

our business involves a risk of product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities additionally as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in 

 

 

 

connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products

 

we rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products

 

some of our products contain technologically advanced components including software that are developed by third parties we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated 

 

in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell 

 

further the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components software andor other intellectual property into the products we sell also individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us

 

the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results and our reputation 

    33

 

 

 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites  

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time

 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store data to among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems andor the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business

 

in addition we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies in particular certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers such as physicians and dentists are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses 

 

regarding direct customer claims although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases

 

in addition our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an is security breach additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services

 

 

 

 

 

risks associated with these and other is security breaches may include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we also deliver internetbased services and accordingly depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the internet in the event of any difficulties outages and delays by internet service providers we may be impeded from providing such services which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 2013 stock incentive plan and 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stockunit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control

 

 

 

 

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act into law which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions we are still analyzing the complex new law to determine its impact in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements

 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services

industry consolidation  

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2017 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting

 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

 

aging population and other market influences 

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2017 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare 

 

 

 

services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 50 during the same time period 

 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20162025” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 34 trillion in 2016 or 181 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 55 trillion in 2025 approximately 199 of the nation’s gross domestic product

 

government

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust antibribery and antikickback customer interaction transparency data privacy data security and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

health care reform

 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 the “health care reform law” increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and on january 22 2018 an additional twoyear moratorium was imposed under public law no 115120 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2018 and ending on december 31 2019 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president is seeking to repeal and replace the health care reform law repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the house of representatives but did not obtain the necessary votes in the senate subsequently the president has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the health care reform law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the health care reform law on december 22 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act into law which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates international tax provisions income tax addback provisions and deductions the tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan

 

 

 

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk a final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and allows eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 a final rule updating certain quality payment program regulations was published on november 16 2017 which became effective as of january 1 2018 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs

 

 

 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with a final rule published by the department of justice on february 3 2017 which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after february 3 2017 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from a minimum perclaim penalty of 10781 to 10957 and from a maximum perclaim penalty of 21563 to 21916 most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

 

 

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and will continue to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdca to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to 

 

 

 

foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions 

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

in addition the european parliament and the council of the european union have adopted a new paneuropean general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective from may 25 2018 which increases privacy rights for individuals in europe extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in europe “data subjects” or monitoring the behavior of such individuals including by companies based outside of europe noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of eur 20 million or 4 of global company revenues individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data among other things the gdpr requires with respect to data concerning data subjects company accountability consents from data subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data prompt breach notifications within 72 hours fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored used or otherwise processed and data integrity and security and provides rights to data subjects relating to modification erasure and transporting of the personal data while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the gdpr requirements our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws regulations and industry standards such as hipaa and the payment card industry data security standards which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements may not only 

 

 

 

cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” 

 

the use of certified ehr technology will continue as a feature of macra’s mips program and in connection with this medicare ehr program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and mips payment adjustments will begin on january 1 2019 the first performance period for mips began january 1 2017 and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria made certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible hospitals

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs cms and onc establish criteria for certified ehr systems and these criteria have been subject to change in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs cms and onc establish criteria for certified ehr systems and these criteria have been subject to change in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria if any of our ehr systems do not meet these standards yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments as noted above we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws such as the false claims act for example on may 31 2017 the us department of justice announced a 155 million settlement and 5year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified ehr systems based on allegations that the vendor by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body caused its health care provider customers to submit false medicare and medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the false claims act while we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our 

 

 

 

business 

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

additionally as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important on september 6 2017 the fda issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information as a medical device manufacturer we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device

 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

 

 

ecommerce

 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

 

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets

 

results of operations

 

the following tables summarize the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december 30 2017 december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 in thousands

 

 

 

plans of restructuring

 

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 this initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities we subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement costsavings initiatives which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions representing slightly more than 4 of our workforce the total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included 349 million pretax which was recorded in fiscal 2015 and 459 million pretax which was recorded in fiscal 2016 the costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income

 

as of december 31 2016 our restructuring activities are complete and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2017

 

    

 

 

 

2017 compared to 2016

 

net sales

 

net sales for 2017 and 2016 were as follows in thousands

 

 

 

the fiscal year ended december 30 2017 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 which consisted of 53 weeks

 

the 8899 million or 77 increase in net sales for the year ended december 30 2017 includes an increase of 72 local currency growth 51 increase in internally generated revenue 15 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 36 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 05 related to foreign currency exchange

 

the 4935 million or 89 increase in dental net sales for the year ended december 30 2017 includes an increase of 79 in local currencies 30 increase in internally generated revenue 14 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 63 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 10 related to foreign currency exchange the 79 increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 45 65 increase in internally generated revenue 24 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 04 growth from acquisitions and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 90 19 increase in internally generated revenue 11 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 82 growth from acquisitions 

 

the 2236 million or 69 increase in animal health net sales for the year ended december 30 2017 includes an increase of 69 local currency growth 63 increase in internally generated revenue 13 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 19 growth from acquisitions the growth in internally generated animal health revenue is affected by the revenue for certain products being recognized on a gross basis in 2017 that had been recognized on an agency basis in the prior year when excluding the effects of this change internally generated revenue grew by 60

the 1603 million or 69 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december 30 2017 includes an increase of 68 local currency growth 84 increase in internally generated revenue and 16 decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 as well as an increase of 01 related to foreign currency exchange

gross profit

 

gross profit and gross margins for 2017 and 2016 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands

 

 

 

gross profit increased 1726 million or 54 for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies

 

health care distribution gross profit increased 1593 million or 54 for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 259 for the year ended december 30 2017 from 265 for the comparable prior year period the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a 1040 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and 1253 million is attributable to acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a 700 million decline in gross profit due to the decrease in the gross margin rates

 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 133 million or 49 for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin increased to 654 for the year ended december 30 2017 from 642 for the comparable prior year period acquisitions accounted for 20 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to the prior year period the remaining increase of 113 million in our technology and valueadded services segment gross profit was primarily attributable to growth in internally generated revenue and the increase in gross margin rates

 

selling general and administrative

 

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2017 and 2016 were as follows in thousands

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1307 million or 54 for the year ended december 30 2017 from the comparable prior year period the 1270 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 30 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 1073 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 197 million of additional operating costs the 37 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our 

 

 

 

technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 30 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 21 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 16 million of additional operating costs as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 204 from 208 for the comparable prior year period 

 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 822 million or 56 for the year ended december 30 2017 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses decreased to 125 from 128 for the comparable prior year period 

 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 485 million or 52 for the year ended december 30 2017 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased to 78 from 80 for the comparable prior year period

 

other expense net

 

other expense net for the years ended 2017 and 2016 was as follows in thousands

 

 

 

other expense net increased 208 million to 365 million for the year ended december 30 2017 from the comparable prior year period interest income increased 43 million primarily due to increased investment and late fee income interest expense increased 218 million primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under our bank credit lines and interest expense related to a financing arrangement entered into during the first quarter of 2017 in brazil other net decreased by 33 million due primarily to investment proceeds received in the first quarter of 2016 

 

income taxes

 

for the year ended december 30 2017 our effective tax rate was 441 compared to 288 for the prior year period our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily higher due to the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax act” our effective tax rate was favorably impacted in 2017 by the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 accounting for stock compensation as well as savings from implementation of tax planning initiatives and higher income from lower tax jurisdictions   during the second quarter of 2016 the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement which reduced our income tax expense by approximately 45 million f or 2018 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 24 

 

on december 22 2017 the us government passed the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act is comprehensive tax legislation that implements complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 modification of accelerated depreciation the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest additionally the tax act moves from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime which requires us companies to pay a mandatory onetime transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the us the transition tax is payable over eight years 

 

due to the complexities of the tax act the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” that allows the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the tax act in accordance with asc 740 to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made sab 118 allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts

 

we have recorded provisional amounts for any items that could be reasonably estimated at this time this includes the onetime transition tax that we have estimated to be 1400 million within our consolidated balance sheets 274 million is included in “accrued taxes” and 1126 million is included in “other liabilities” the us 

 

 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate of 21 that was effective january 1 2018 the company accrued a net deferred tax expense of 30 million attributable to the revaluation in the aggregate for the quarter ended december 30 2017 these tax act modifications resulted in a onetime tax expense of approximately 1430 million absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities our effective tax rate for the year ended december 30 2017 would have been 267 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 441 

 

the tax act also includes provisions to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and a base erosion and antiabuse tax “beat” that imposes tax on certain foreign relatedparty payments the company is subject to the gilti and beat provisions which are effective january 1 2018 the company is in the process of assessing the effects of these provisions for 2018

 

the ultimate impacts of the tax act may differ from the estimate above possibly materially due to additional guidance from the us department of treasury updates or changes in our assumptions revision of accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations and future information that may become available we currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the quarter ended september 29 2018 if the information necessary to finalize and record the related tax impacts are available prior to the quarter ended september 29 2018 we will book these impacts accordingly

 

net income

 

net income decreased 971 million or 175 for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above

the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended december 26 2015 which consisted of 52 weeks

 

the 9419 million or 89 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 includes an increase of 101 local currency growth 67 increase in internally generated revenue 15 impact from extra week and 19 growth from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 12 related to foreign currency exchange

 

the 2789 million or 53 increase in dental net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 includes an increase of 62 in local currencies 32 increase in internally generated revenue 15 impact from extra week and 15 growth from acquisitions offset by a decrease of 09 related to foreign currency exchange the 62 increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 90 51 increase in internally generated revenue 25 impact from extra week and 14 growth from acquisitions and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 53 26 increase in internally generated revenue 12 impact from extra week and 15 growth from acquisitions

the 2647 million or 128 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 includes an increase of 128 local currency growth 111 increase in internally generated revenue and 17 impact from extra week the growth in internally generated medical revenue is affected by certain sales being recognized on a gross basis in 2016 that had been recognized on an agency basis in the prior year when excluding the effects of this change internally generated revenue grew by 79

gross profit

 

gross profit and gross margins for 2016 and 2015 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands

 

 

 

gross profit increased 2195 million or 73 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies

 

health care distribution gross profit increased 1845 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 265 for the year ended december 31 2016 from 270 for the comparable prior year period the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a 1708 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and 609 million is attributable to acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a 472 million decline in gross profit due primarily to the effects of foreign exchange on revenues and the decrease in the gross margin rates 

 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 350 million or 147 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin decreased to 642 for the year ended december 31 2016 from 664 for the comparable prior year period acquisitions accounted for 185 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period the remaining increase of 165 million in our technology and valueadded services segment gross profit was primarily attributable to growth in internally generated revenue

 

 

 

selling general and administrative

 

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2016 and 2015 were as follows in thousands

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1710 million or 76 for the year ended december 31 2016 from the comparable prior year period the 1488 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 576 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 912 million of additional operating costs the 222 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 153 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 69 million of additional operating costs as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 208 from 211 for the comparable prior year period

 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 1043 million or 76 for the year ended december 31 2016 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses decreased to 128 from 130 for the comparable prior year period 

 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 667 million or 77 for the year ended december 31 2016 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased to 80 from 81 for the comparable prior year period

 

 

other expense net

 

other expense net for the years ended 2016 and 2015 was as follows in thousands

 

 

 

other expense net increased 25 million to 157 million for the year ended december 31 2016 from the comparable prior year period interest expense increased 59 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our bank credit lines and our us trade accounts receivable securitization higher interest rates also contributed to the increase in interest expense other net increased by 30 million due primarily to investment proceeds received in the first quarter of 2016 

 

income taxes

 

for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective tax rate was 288 compared to 293 for the prior year period during the second quarter of 2016 the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement which reduced our income tax expense by approximately 45 million 

 

during the third quarter of 2015 we received a favorable response to a tax petition which allowed us to conclude that it was more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits which had been previously reserved would be realized as a result our provision for income taxes in 2015 included a 63 million income tax benefit

 

 

 

 

absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26 2015 would have been 302 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 293 the remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense 

 

net income

 

net income increased 330 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year

 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers

 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements

 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements

 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5455 million for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to 6426 million for the prior year the net change of 971 million was primarily attributable to working capital requirements 

 

net cash used in inv esting activities was 3423 million for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to 3164 million for the prior year the net change of 259 million was primarily due to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds of sales of equity investments 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1126 million for the year ended december 30 2017 compared to 3273 million for the prior year the net change of 2147 million was primarily due to increased net borrowings from debt decreased repurchases of common stock and decreased acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

 

 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands

 

 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity

 

 

 

 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns

  

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations decreased to 412 days as of december 30 2017 from 413 days as of december 31 2016 during the years ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 we wrote off approximately 67 million and 62 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve   our inventory turns from operations were 53 as of december 30 2017 and 55 as of december 31 2016 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions

bank credit lines

 

on april 18 2017 we entered into a new  750 million revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” this facility which matures in april 2022 replaced our 500 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in september 2019 the interest rate is based on the usd libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter the credit agreement provides among other things that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios and contains customary representations warranties and affirmative covenants the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants subject to negotiated exceptions on liens indebtedness significant corporate changes including mergers dispositions and certain restrictive agreements as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility and the prior credit facility were 3200 million and 650 million respectively as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 there were 113 million and 130 million of letters of credit respectively provided to third parties under this credit facility and the prior credit facility

 

as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 we had various other shortterm bank credit lines available of which 4217 million and 3725 million respectively were outstanding at december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 227 and 161 respectively

 

private placement facilities

 

on september 15 2017 we increased our available private placement facilities with three insurance companies to a total facility amount of 1 billion and extended the expiration date to september 15 2020 these facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance from time to time through september 15 2020 the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years with an average life no longer than 12 years the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness andor to fund potential acquisitions the agreements provide among other things that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios and 

 

 

 

contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness liens affiliate transactions disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership these facilities contain makewhole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates 

 

the components of our private placement facility borrowings as of december 30 2017 are presented in the following table in thousands

 

 

 

us trade accounts receivable securitization

 

we have a facility agreement with a bank as agent based on the securitization of our us trade accounts receivable that is structured as an assetbacked securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years on june 1 2016 we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 29 2019 and increased the purchase limit under the facility from 300 million to 350 million on july 6 2017 we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 29 2020 the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were 3500 million and 3500 million as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively at december 30 2017 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 153 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 228 at december 31 2016 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 101 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 176

 

we are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50 of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50 of the facility limit

 

borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet

 

 

 

longterm debt

 

longterm debt consisted of the following

 

 

 

stock repurchases

 

from june 21 2004 through december 30 2017 we repurchased approximately 27 billion or 55670990 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 2000 million available as of december 30 2017 for future common stock share repurchases

 

redeemable noncontrolling interests

 

some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value accounting standards codification topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 30 2017 december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 are presented in the following table

 

 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share

 

 

 

 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income

 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 1052 million as of december 30 2017 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements

  revenue recognition  

we generate revenue from the sale of dental animal health and medical consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized

 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided

 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling 

 

 

 

price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

accounts receivable and reserves

 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

inventories and reserves

 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental animal health and medical and technology and valueadded services goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis

 

for the years ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a twostep approach the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units including goodwill to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss if any that we would record for such reporting unit the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill 

 

our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections

 

 

 

 

our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable

 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include

 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

 

•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business eg decision to divest a business or 

 

•   significant negative industry or economic trends 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income

 

for the years ended december 30 2017 december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments

 

supplier rebates

 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

longlived assets

 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets

 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation represents the cost related to stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period our stockbased compensation expense is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income

 

 

 

 

stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan as amended and our 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan together the “plans” the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors prior to march 2009 awards under the plans principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations

 

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions we issue restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan which are primarily 12month cliff vesting and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting

 

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant

 

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets for significant events including without limitation acquisitions divestitures new business ventures certain capital transactions including share repurchases restructuring costs if any changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations foreign exchange fluctuations certain litigation related costs and material changes in income tax rates over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans

 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

 

 

 

accounting pronouncements adopted

 

in march 2016 the financial accounting standard board “fasb” issued asu no 201609 “stock compensation” topic 718 “asu 201609” asu 201609 contains amended guidance for sharebased payment accounting we adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2017 

 

under asu 201609 all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the stockbased compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes are included as a component of income tax expense as of january 1 2017 prior to the implementation of asu 201609 excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of additional paidin capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits or in the income statement if there were no accumulated excess tax benefits the adoption of asu 201609 reduced income tax expense by approximately 196 million for the year ended december 30 2017

 

the asu clarifies the classification of certain share based payment activities within the statements of cash flows we have elected to prospectively present the amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as a component of cash flows from operating activities additionally all cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employees’ behalf when directly withholding shares for taxwithholding purposes which were previously included as cash flows from operating activities are now presented retrospectively as cash flows from financing activities within the statement of cash flows 

 

recently issued accounting standards

 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201409” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states “us gaap” the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap

 

in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers” which deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date 

 

when effective asu 201409 will require us to use either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures to describe the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue certain costs and cash flows arising from our contracts with customers  

 

we have finalized our review of our various revenue streams within our two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services we have gathered data and quantified the amount of sales by type of revenue stream and categorized the types of sales for our business units for the purpose of comparing how we currently recognize revenue to the new standard in order to quantify the impact of this asu we generally anticipate having substantially similar performance obligations under the new guidance as compared with deliverables and units of account currently being recognized 

 

we do not anticipate any material changes to the timing or amount of revenues recognized for our health care distribution or our technology and valueadded services reportable segments

 

  due to the variety of our product offerings in our technology and valueadded segment the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard will depend on contractspecific terms there will be some impact on timing of revenue recognition which will include the following  

 

 

 

 

·   we currently defer license revenue in cases where we do not have vsoe of the fair value of an element in the arrangement that has not been delivered yet such as customer support under accounting standards codification “asc” 606 the concept of vsoe is eliminated and there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of standalone selling price as such we will recognize certain revenue related to the software license earlier than current practice 

 

·   certain upfront fees related to service arrangements are currently deferred and recognized over the estimated customer life under asc 606 the period over which we will recognize these fees will be reduced 

 

·   revenue related to term licenses is currently recognized over the license term under asc 606 the license will be recognized upon delivery or license renewal 

 

·   we currently expense contract acquisition costs the new requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate will require us to capitalize additional costs we will utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less which will typically result in expensing commissions on all products or services except our software support contracts 

 

in these cases we generally will recognize revenue related to technology and valueadded contracts earlier than current practice while certain contract acquisition costs will be recognized later than current practice however we do not believe the impact will be material to each of our segments or to our consolidated financial statements

 

as of december 31 2017 we expect to adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis and recognize an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings reflecting the cumulative impact for the above described accounting changes

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases” topic 842 “asu 201602” asu 201602 contains guidance on accounting for leases and requires that most lease assets and liabilities and the associated rights and obligations be recognized on the company’s balance sheet asu 201602 focuses on lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles for leases with a term of 12 months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities asu 201602 will require disclosures regarding the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the standard which requires the use of a modified retrospective approach will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are currently exploring the methods we can use to gather and process our operating lease data at a worldwide consolidated level

 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 “intangiblesgoodwill and other” topic 350 “asu 201704” asu 201704 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test thereby eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit asu 201704 will require us to perform our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those units if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we will be required to recognize an impairment charge however the impairment charge should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit asu 201704 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 we do not expect that the requirements of asu 201704 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201709 “compensationstock compensation topic 718 scope of modification accounting” “asu 201709” asu 201709 clarifies guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of sharebased payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting asu 201709 requires modification accounting if the fair value vesting conditions or equity or liability classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award asu 201709 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 

 

 

 

we do not expect that the requirements of asu 201709 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201712 “derivatives and hedging” topic 815 “asu 201712” which simplifies the requirements for hedge accounting more closely aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities and increases transparency of the scope and results of hedging activities this asu amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how we can assess the effectiveness of our hedging relationships this asu will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting asu 201712 is required to be implemented for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption of asu 201712 is permitted in any interim period after the issuance of this asu we do not expect that the requirements of asu 201712 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost this asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 this asu is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective basis with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance of this asu is effective based upon the level and makeup of our financial asset portfolio past loan loss activity and current known activity regarding our outstanding loans we do not expect that this asu will have a material impact on the results of our consolidated financial statements

 

 

 

 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital

 

foreign currency agreements

 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2017 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2017 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 73 million

 

as of december 30 2017 we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through june 27 2018 which include a marktomarket loss of 10 million as determined by quoted market prices as of december 30 2017 henry schein inc had euro to brazilian real brl cross currency swap contracts notionally totaling an amount of €78 million with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net asset of 107 million a 5 increase in the value of the euro to the brl from december 30 2017 with all other variables held constant would have had a favorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by increasing the value of these instruments by 48 million 

 

shortterm investments

 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

 

variable interest rate debt

 

as of december 30 2017 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization

 

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on april 18 2017 and expires in april 2022 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 30 2017 there was 3200 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility during the year ended december 30 2017 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 3246 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 08 million

 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and which expires on april 29 2020 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 153 basis points plus 75 basis points as of december 30 2017 we had an outstanding balance of 3500 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 30 2017 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 3496 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this 

 

 

 

securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 09 million

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

the combination of continued acquisition integrations and systems implementations undertaken during the quarter and carried over from prior quarters when considered in the aggregate represents a material change in our internal control over financial reporting

 

during the quarter ended december 30 2017 we completed the acquisition of a us dental business with approximate aggregate annual revenues of 16 million in addition postacquisition integration related activities continued for our global dental and animal health businesses acquired during prior quarters representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately 511 million these acquisitions the majority of which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition 

 

also during the quarter ended december 30 2017 we continued the phased implementation of a new equipment system for our us dental business to centers representing approximate aggregate annual revenues of 159 million additionally we completed the implementation of a new erp system at a dental business in italy having approximate aggregate annual revenues of 49 million finally our us medical business continued the phased implementation of a new sales commission application which now covers approximately 84 million of annual sales commission expense

 

all acquisition integrations and systems implementations involved necessary and appropriate changemanagement controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions

industry

 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2016 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management

 

competition  

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental animal health and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level in the animal health market our primary competitors are the mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc our primary competitors in the medical market are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records 

 

market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services limited patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc centaur services limited mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic denmark france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand and the united kingdom

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

business strategy

 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

markets served 

 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2016 and 2026 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2016 and 2036 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 25 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2016 and 2026 and approximately 15 between 2016 and 2036 

 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage

 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software

 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner

 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

governmental regulations

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 subject to certain enforcement delays by the fda and will continue to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs the dscsa requires wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi 

 

regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses 

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “anti 

 

kickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with an interim final rule published by the department justice on june 30 2016 which substantially increased maximum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after august 1 2016 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from 11000 per claim for prenovember 2 2011 violations to up to 21563 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

health care reform

 

the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the 

 

imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president and majorities in both houses of congress have stated their intention to repeal the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity the centers for medicine and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” programs into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and announced some flexibilities that allow eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs”

 

the use of certified ehr technology will continue as a feature of macra’s mips program and in connection with this medicare ehr program payment adjustments to eligible clinicians will sunset at the end of 2018 and mips payment adjustments will begin on january 1 2019 the first performance period for mips began january 1 2017 and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria made certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible hospitals

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing 

 

governmental criteria moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

international transactions

 

in addition united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the united states

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors

  

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority

 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability additionally in this competitive market some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability

 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products

 

we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock

 

our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute

 

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected  

 

 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline

 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage

  the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

  increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business  

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall 

 

recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business

 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other things trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and in the case of animal health practitioners changes in the use of feed additives including without limitation antibiotics and growth promotants used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions animal welfare andor government regulations and changes in customer buying habits including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians’ offices if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

 

the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business 

 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers 

 

 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president and the majorities in both houses of congress have stated their intention to repeal the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law also affects our ability to plan 

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the macra enacted on april 16 2015 establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through mips or apms mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare ehr program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and announced some flexibilities that will allow eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals  we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us

 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations 

 

applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products  and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality

 

the fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with an interim final rule published by the department of justice on june 30 2016 which substantially increased maximum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after august 1 2016 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from 11000 per claim for prenovember 2 2011 violations to up to 21563 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the german anticorruption law and other antibribery laws anticorruption laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of non‑compliance we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters for example one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software which resulted in a consent order and fine failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business

 

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities

 

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as hipaa hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

in addition federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr systems in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and onc

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria making certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible 

 

hospitals 

 

in addition under macra which establishes mips over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program apparently with modified applicable requirements and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria

 

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business

 

global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks

 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect

 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be materially adversely affected

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury

 

our business involves a risk of product liability  intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability  intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities additionally as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products

 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites  

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time

 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store data to among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems andor the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business

 

in addition we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies in particular certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers such as physicians and dentists are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our 

 

products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses 

 

regarding direct customer claims although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases

 

in addition our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an is security breach additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services

 

risks associated with these and other is security breaches may include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we also deliver internetbased services and accordingly depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the internet in the event of any difficulties outages and delays by internet service providers we may be impeded from providing such services which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation

 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 2013 stock incentive plan and 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee 

 

under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stockunit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control 

 

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2016 fiscal year




 item 2 properties

  

we own or lease the following properties with more than 100000 square feet

executivelevel overview  

we believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners we serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories animal health clinics and physician practices as well as government institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 84 years of experience distributing health care products

 

 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 21000 people of which more than 10500 are based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries including the united states australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic denmark france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand and the united kingdom

 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment

 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base

 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions

 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as continuing education services for practitioners

  industry overview  

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management

 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements

 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services

industry consolidation  

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2016 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices

 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier

 

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting

 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

 

aging population and other market influences 

 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices

 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2015 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare 

 

services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 65 during the same time period 

 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20152025” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 32 trillion in 2015 or 178 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 56 trillion in 2025 approximately 201 of the nation’s gross domestic product

 

government

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust data privacy data security and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

health care reform

 

the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage

 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales however with respect to the medical device excise tax a twoyear moratorium was imposed under the consolidated appropriations act 2016 suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented in addition the president and the majorities in both houses of congress have stated their intention to repeal the health care reform law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan

 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities

 

 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us

 

another notable medicare health care reform initiative the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” enacted on april 16 2015 establishes a new payment framework called the quality payment program which modifies certain medicare payments to “eligible clinicians” including physicians dentists and other practitioners under macra eligible clinicians will be required to participate in medicare through the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” or advanced alternative payment models “apms” mips generally will consolidate three current programs the physician quality reporting system the valuebased payment modifier and the medicare electronic health record “ehr” program into a single program in which medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality resource use clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified ehr technology advanced apms generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk the final rule was published in the federal register on november 4 2016 and allow eligible medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began january 1 2017 the data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning january 1 2019 macra represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations the implications of the implementation of macra are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace macra may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this

 

health care fraud

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and in accordance with an interim final rule published by the department of justice on june 30 2016 which substantially increased maximum civil penalties for false claims act violations the amounts for civil penalties assessed after august 1 2016 whose associated violations occurred after november 2 2015 were increased from 11000 per claim for prenovember 2 2011 violations up to 21563 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability

 

 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act german anticorruption laws and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years

 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance

 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

operating security and licensure standards

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended “fdc act” and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations

 

the fdc act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products”

 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” is being phased in over a period of ten years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect in january 2015 and will continue to be implemented the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements 

 

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements

 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 amended the fdca to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification “udi” system the fda is phasing in the implementation of the udi regulations over seven years generally beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices the udi regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers “udis” with a content and format prescribed by the fda and issued under a system operated by an fdaaccredited issuing agency on the labels and packages of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis the udi regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning udilabeled devices to the fda much of which information is publicly available on an fda database the global unique device identification database the udi regulations provide for certain exceptions alternatives and time extensions for example the udi regulations include a general exception for class i devices exempt from the quality system regulation other than recordkeeping requirements and complaint files regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers repackagers reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses

 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea

 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions 

 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors

 

antitrust

 

the us federal government most us states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anticompetitive violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations including claims for treble damages

 

regulated software electronic health records

 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products

 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities

 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

 

 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” 

 

the use of certified ehr technology will continue as a feature of macra’s mips program and in connection with this medicare ehr program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and mips payment adjustments will begin on january 1 2019 the first performance period for mips began january 1 2017 and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting

 

on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things established the more challenging “stage 3” criteria made certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalized 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards on november 14 2016 cms published a final rule that will impact medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals critical access hospitals and dualeligible hospitals

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs cms and onc establish criteria for certified ehr systems and these criteria have been subject to change in order to maintain certification of our ehr products we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria moreover in order to satisfy our customers our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this the effort may involve increased costs and our failure to implement product modifications or otherwise satisfy applicable standards could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care

 

ecommerce

 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 this initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities we subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement costsavings initiatives which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions representing slightly more than 4 of our workforce the total costs associated with the actions to date for this restructuring include 349 million pretax which was recorded in fiscal 2015 and 459 million pretax which has been recorded in fiscal 2016 the costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income

 

as of december 31 2016 our restructuring activities are complete and we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2017

gross profit increased 2217 million or 74 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies

 

health care distribution gross profit increased 1845 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 265 for the year ended december 31 2016 from 270 for the comparable prior year period the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a 1708 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and 609 million is attributable to acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a 472 million decline in gross profit due primarily to the effects of foreign exchange on revenues and the decrease in the gross margin rates

during the third quarter of 2015 we received a favorable response to a tax petition which allowed us to conclude that it was more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits which had been previously reserved would be realized as a result our provision for income taxes in 2015 included a 63 million income tax benefit

 

absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26 2015 would have been 302 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 293 the remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense for 2017 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 28

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year

 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers

 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements

 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements

 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements

redeemable noncontrolling interests

 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value accounting standards codification topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31 2016 december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 are presented in the following table

 

 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share

 

 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income

 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 1074 million as of december 31 2016 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements

  revenue recognition  

we generate revenue from the sale of dental animal health and medical consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized

 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided

 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a 

 

standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

accounts receivable and reserves

 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

inventories and reserves

 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental animal health and medical and technology and valueadded services goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis

 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a twostep approach the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units including goodwill to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss if any that we would record for such reporting unit the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill 

 

our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections

 

 

for the year ended december 27 2014 we tested goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” which allowed us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we considered in developing our qualitative assessment included

 

•   macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments we also consider our growth in market share in the markets in which we compete 

 

•   credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms 

 

•   key personnel and management expertise as well as our growth strategies for the next several years and 

 

•   our expectations of selling or disposing all or a portion of a reporting unit 

 

our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable

 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include

 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

 

•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business eg decision to divest a business or 

 

•   significant negative industry or economic trends 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income

 

for the years ended december 31 2016 december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments

 

supplier rebates

 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

longlived assets

 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets

 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to 

 

fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation represents the cost related to stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period our stockbased compensation expense is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income

 

stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan as amended and our 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan together the “plans” the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors prior to march 2009 awards under the plans principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations

 

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions we issue restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan which are primarily 12month cliff vesting and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting

 

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant

 

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures certain capital transactions including share repurchases restructuring costs if any changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations and certain foreign exchange fluctuations over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans

 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 

 

accounting pronouncements adopted

 

in april 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201503 “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu 201503” asu 201503 requires that debt issuance costs be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability consistent with the presentation of debt discounts further asu 201503 requires the amortization 

 

of debt issuance costs to be reported as interest expense similarly debt issuance costs and any discount or premium are considered in the aggregate when determining the effective interest rate on the debt asu 201503 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years asu 201503 must be applied retrospectively entities may choose to adopt the new requirements as of an earlier date for financial statements that have not been previously issued the adoption of this asu during 2016 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 “simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” “asu 201516” asu 201516 removes the previous requirement for an acquiring company to restate prior period financial results due to measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 requires that an acquirer recognize provisional amounts that are identified during the measurementperiod in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined asu 201516 also requires presentation of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item either on the face of the income statement or within the notes to financial statements which would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date asu 201516 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period the guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance the adoption of this asu during 2016 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 topic 740 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” “asu 201517” asu 201517 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued the asu may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the company elected to early adopt asu 201517 prospectively in the third quarter of 2016 as a result all deferred tax assets and liabilities have been presented as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016 there was no impact on our results of operations as a result of the adoption of asu 201517 and prior periods have not been adjusted

 

recently issued accounting standards

 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201409” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states “us gaap” the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap

 

in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201514” which deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period

 

when effective asu 201409 will use either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures 

 

currently we are reviewing our various revenue streams within our two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services we are gathering data to quantify the amount of sales by type of revenue stream concurrently through the use of various data gathering methods we are categorizing the types of sales for our business units for the purpose of comparing how we currently recognize revenue for the purpose of quantifying the impact if any that this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases” topic 842 “asu 201602” asu 201602 contains guidance on accounting for leases and requires that most lease assets and liabilities and the associated rights and obligations be recognized on the company’s balance sheet asu 201602 focuses on lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles for leases with a term of 12 months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities asu 201602 will require disclosures regarding the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the standard which requires the use of a modified retrospective approach will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are currently in the early stages of evaluating the impact of asu 201602 on our consolidated financial statements

 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 “stock compensation” topic 718 “asu 201609” asu 201609 contains amended guidance for sharebased payment accounting we will adopt the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2017

  

the impact of asu 201609 to our accounting for income taxes will require us to record all excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of income tax expense using the prospective transition method beginning as of january 1 2017 prior to the implementation of this asu excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of additional paid in capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits if any or in the income statement 

 

in addition the asu clarifies the classification of certain share based payment activities within the statements of cash flow we have elected to prospectively present the amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as a component of cash flow from operating activities 

 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost this asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 this asu is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective basis with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance of this asu is effective based upon the level and makeup of our financial asset portfolio past loan loss activity and current known activity regarding our outstanding loans we do not expect that this asu will have a material impact on the results of our consolidated financial statements

 

 

 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital

 

foreign currency agreements

 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2016 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2016 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 63 million

 

as of december 31 2016 we had foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through may 31 2017 which include a marktomarket gain of 03 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 35 million 

 

shortterm investments

 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

 

variable interest rate debt

 

as of december 31 2016 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization

 

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on september 22 2014 and expires on september 22 2019 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 31 2016 there was 650 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2016 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 2140 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 05 million

 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and which expires on april 29 2019 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 101 basis points plus 75 basis points as of december 31 2016 we had an outstanding balance of 3500 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 31 2016 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 3220 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would have increased by 08 million

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners we serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories animal health clinics and physician practices as well as government institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 83 years of experience distributing health care products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 19000 people of which more than 8500 are based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries including the united states australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic denmark france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

we offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and valueadded solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care we operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 110000 branded products and henry schein private brand products in stock as well as more than 150000 additional products available as special order items we also offer our customers exclusive innovative technology solutions including practice management software and ecommerce solutions as well as a broad range of financial services 

we have established over four million square feet of space in 61 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions 

our technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2015 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental animal health and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level in the animal health market our primary competitors are the mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc our primary competitors in the medical market are mckesson corporation and medline industries inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services limited patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc centaur services limited mwi animal health division of amerisourcebergen and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic denmark france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg malaysia the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia south africa spain sweden switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

  

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

products 

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2015 and 2025 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2015 and 2035 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 25 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2015 and 2025 and approximately 15 between 2015 and 2035 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

operating security and licensure standards 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as “hctp products” 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” will be phased in over 10 years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs began to take effect in january 2015 subject to certain enforcement delays by the fda for example the fda announced that in light of difficulties experienced by some dispensers in establishing electronic systems to handle required product tracing information it would delay to march 1 2016 its enforcement of certain track and trace requirements scheduled to apply to dispensers on july 1 2015 although this delay does not affect current dscsa requirements that apply to other trading partners such as manufacturers and wholesale distributors the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements also in january 2015 the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a “suspect” or “illegitimate” product and handle it accordingly 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs beginning january 1 2015 the dscsa required wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa which to date the fda has not yet issued 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 “fdaaa” and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 “fdasia” amended the fdc act to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification system the fda issued a final rule on september 24 2013 implementing the unique device identification system requiring the labels of most medical devices to bear a unique device identifier “udi” and prescribing the content and format of the udi the rule also requires the submission of certain information concerning udilabeled devices to an fda database the global unique device identification database “gudid” additional fda udi guidance has subsequently been issued and the fda’s udi regulations are being phased in over seven years from the rule’s promulgation in september 2013 beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices for the lowestrisk class i medical devices a universal product code may take the place of a udi on the device’s label 

  

 

the fda’s udi regulations require certain entities referred to as “labelers” to develop and include udis on the labels of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis labelers are entities that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified without any subsequent replacement or modification typically these entities are device manufacturers specification developers singleuse device reprocessors convenience kit assemblers repackagers and relabelers 

violations of the udi regulations including failure to include a udi on a device’s label after the effective date for the device type result in the misbranding of the device the fdc act makes it unlawful to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded device it is also unlawful to cause a device to become misbranded 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions there have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government globally to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

  

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

health care reform 

the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 a moratorium was imposed beginning january 1 2016 and ending december 31 2017 and therefore the tax does not apply to sales during that period and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted as a result while upholding the law generally the united states supreme court has effectively made the health care reform law’s medicaid expansion voluntary for each state there has been an effort by the political party in control of congress to repeal some or all of the law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

  

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us 

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” in accordance with applicable requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those 

  

  

 

systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” generally initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 and more demanding “stage 2” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014 on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things establish the more challenging “stage 3” criteria make certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalize 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards in addition under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 macra which establishes the meritbased incentive payment system mips over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program apparently with modified applicable requirements and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches

 

certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria 

hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission called the icd10cm the icd10cm standard was implemented on october 1 2015 and claims with dates of service of october 1 2015 or after must be submitted using icd10cm code sets certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care 

international transactions 

in addition united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability additionally in this competitive market some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability  

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

  

our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be materially adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate if our financial results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our financial results although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

increases in shipping costs or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

 

  

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and suppliers which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties including among other things sovereign debt levels the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues consumer confidence election results unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population interest rates availability of capital fuel and energy costs tax rates health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest could adversely impact our customers and suppliers which could materially adversely affect us changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall additionally recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and in the case of animal health practitioners changes in the use of feed additives including without limitation  antibiotics and growth promotants used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions animal welfare andor government regulations and changes in customer buying habits including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians’ offices if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the health care reform law could have a material adverse effect on our business and the health care reform law may be invalidated in whole or in part or it may be repealed additionally further federal and state proposals for health care reform in the united states are likely and foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold as part of hr 2029 – consolidated appropriations act 2016 a moratorium was imposed on the medical device excise tax for the period beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 as such the medical device excise tax does not apply to sales during that period 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities which began on august 1 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws as well as the federal law can be ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us 

  

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality 

the fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws anticorruption laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results including without limitation securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance we may determine to enter into settlements make payments agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters for example one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission “ftc” related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software which resulted in a consent order and fine failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business 

 

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur substantial fines penalties or other liabilities 

our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as hipaa hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation also evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission called the icd10cm the icd10cm standard was implemented on october 1 2015 and claims with dates of service of october 1 2015 or after must be submitted using icd10cm code sets certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

in addition federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr systems in accordance with applicable requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and onc generally initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 and more demanding “stage 2” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014 on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things establish the more challenging “stage 3” criteria making certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalize 2015 edition health technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with 

  

  

  

stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards in addition under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 macra which establishes the meritbased incentive payment system mips over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program apparently with modified applicable requirements and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria

  

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business 

global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

  

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be materially adversely affected 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities additionally as our privatelabel business continues to grow purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us rather than the ultimate product manufacturer for productrelated claims another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

  

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business 

security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems or thirdparty systems we rely on are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze manage and store data to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems andor the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies in particular certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers such as physicians and dentists are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties costs for remediation and substantial defense and settlement expenses 

  

regarding direct customer claims although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases 

in addition our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an is security breach additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services 

risks associated with these and other is security breaches may include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we also deliver internetbased services and accordingly depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the internet in the event of any difficulties outages and delays by internet service providers we may be impeded from providing such services which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

in addition our 2013 stock incentive plan and 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stockunit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control 

  

tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions

industry overview 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2015 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2014 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 18 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 60 during the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20142024” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 31 trillion in 2014 or 177 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 54 trillion in 2024 approximately 196 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

health care reform 

the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 a moratorium was imposed beginning january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 and therefore the tax does not apply to sales during that period and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted as a result while upholding the law generally the united states supreme court has effectively made the health care reform law’s medicaid expansion voluntary for each state there has been an effort by the political party in control of congress to repeal some or all of the law the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act and some of these state laws are also ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us 

 

  

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim most states have adopted similar state false claims laws and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

operating security and licensure standards 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state 

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” will be phased in over 10 years and is intended to build a national 

 

  

electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs began to take effect in january 2015 subject to certain enforcement delays by the united states food and drug administration “fda” for example the fda announced that in light of difficulties experienced by some dispensers in establishing electronic systems to handle required product tracing information it would delay to march 1 2016 its enforcement of certain track and trace requirements scheduled to apply to dispensers on july 1 2015 although this delay does not affect current dscsa requirements that apply to other trading partners such as manufacturers and wholesale distributors the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements also in january 2015 the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a “suspect” or “illegitimate” product and handle it accordingly

 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs beginning january 1 2015 the dscsa required wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements 

the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 “fdaaa” and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 “fdasia” amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification system the fda issued a final rule on september 24 2013 implementing the unique device identification system requiring the labels of most medical devices to bear a unique device identifier “udi” and prescribing the content and format of the udi the rule also requires the submission of certain information concerning udilabeled devices to an fda database the global unique device identification database “gudid” additional fda udi guidance has subsequently been issued and the fda’s udi regulations are being phased in over seven years from the rule’s promulgation in september 2013 beginning with the highestrisk devices ie class iii medical devices and ending with the lowestrisk devices for the lowestrisk class i medical devices a universal product code may take the place of a udi on the device’s label 

the fda’s udi regulations require certain entities referred to as “labelers” to develop and include udis on the labels of medical devices and to directly mark certain devices with udis labelers are entities that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified without any subsequent replacement or modification typically these entities are device manufacturers specification developers singleuse device reprocessors convenience kit assemblers repackagers and relabelers 

violations of the udi regulations including failure to include a udi on a device’s label after the effective date for the device type result in the misbranding of the device the fdca makes it unlawful to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded device it is also unlawful to cause a device to become misbranded 

we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements 

 

  

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

in addition our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health clinical financial and other sensitive information of individuals these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown wrongful intrusions data breaches and malicious attack which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties andor governmental agencies for example we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities 

we also sell products and services that health care providers such as physicians and dentists use to store and manage patient medical or dental records these customers are subject to laws and regulations such as hipaa which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements may not only cause us significant reputational harm but may also lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies and involve substantial fines penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation 

federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiatives include providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” in accordance with applicable requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for applicable health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” of the department of health and human services “hhs” generally initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 and more demanding “stage 2” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014 on october 6 2015 cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that among other things establish the more challenging “stage 3” criteria make certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards eg reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days and finalize 2015 edition health information technology hit certification criteria which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria but not required until 2018 notably under the new rules compliance with stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017 and would generally be required for all eligible providers regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period in connection with the release of the october 6 rules hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards in addition under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 macra which establishes the meritbased incentive payment system mips over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more 

 

  

 

comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program apparently with modified applicable requirements and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and therefore we must maintain compliance with and are affected by these changing governmental criteria

 

hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission called the icd10cm the icd10cm standard was implemented on october 1 2015 and claims with dates of service of october 1 2015 or after must be submitted using icd10cm code sets certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care 

ecommerce 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets 

  

results of operations 

the following tables summarize the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december 26 2015 december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 in thousands 

 

plans of restructuring 

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities we have subsequently determined that the restructuring activities under this initiative will not be completed until the first half of fiscal 2016 

the total costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring are expected to be in the range of 41 million to 47 million pretax of which 349 million pretax were recorded during the year ended december 26 2015 these ongoing actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure to fund new initiatives to drive future growth under our 2015 – 2017 strategic planning cycle 

on february 5 2016 we estimated that the total remaining restructuring costs we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring activity to be 6 million to 12 million consisting of 5 million to 10 million in employee severance pay and benefits and 1 million to 2 million in facility costs representing primarily lease termination and other facility closure related costs 

the costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income 

  

2015 compared to 2014 

net sales 

net sales for 2015 and 2014 were as follows in thousands 

 

the 2583 million or 25 increase in net sales for the year ended december 26 2015 includes an increase of 84 local currency growth 50 increase in internally generated revenue and 34 growth from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 59 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 1048 million or 19 decrease in dental net sales for the year ended december 26 2015 includes an increase of 50 in local currencies 44 increase in internally generated revenue and 06 growth from acquisitions offset by a decrease of 69 related to foreign currency exchange the 50 increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 70 64 increase in internally generated revenue and 06 growth from acquisitions and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 44 38 increase in internally generated revenue and 06 growth from acquisitions 

the 230 million or 08 increase in animal health net sales for the year ended december 26 2015 includes an increase of 84 local currency growth 19 increase in internally generated revenue and 65 growth from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 76 related to foreign currency exchange the growth in internally generated animal health revenue is affected by certain products switching between agency sales and standard sales as well as changes to our veterinary diagnostics manufacturer relationships when excluding the effects of these items internally generated revenue grew 56 

the 3302 million or 189 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december 26 2015 includes an increase of 197 local currency growth 122 increase in internally generated revenue and 75 growth from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 08 related to foreign currency exchange

gross profit 

gross profit and gross margins for 2015 and 2014 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

gross profit increased 1009 million or 35 for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

health care distribution gross profit increased 885 million or 33 for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 270 for the year ended december 26 2015 from 267 for the comparable prior year period the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is primarily attributable to acquisitions which contributed 986 million of additional gross profit in our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period the offsetting decrease of 101 million in our health care distribution segment gross profit was primarily attributable to the effects of foreign exchange 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 125 million or 54 for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin increased to 679 for the year ended december 26 2015 from 662 for the comparable prior year period acquisitions accounted for 16 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period the remaining increase of 109 million in our technology and valueadded services segment gross profit was attributable to improvements in the gross margin rate resulting from changes in product mix 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2015 and 2014 were as follows in thousands 

 

 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 472 million or 21 for the year ended december 26 2015 from the comparable prior year period the 398 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 26 2015 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 969 million of additional costs from acquired companies partially offset by a reduction of 571 million of costs primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange the 74 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 26 2015 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 13 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 61 million of additional operating costs as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 211 from 212 for the comparable prior year period 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses decreased 128 million or 09 for the year ended december 26 2015 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses decreased to 130 from 134 for the comparable prior year period 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 600 million or 74 for the year ended december 26 2015 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased to 82 from 78 for the comparable prior year period 

other expense net 

other expense net for the years ended 2015 and 2014 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net increased 74 million to 132 million for the year ended december 26 2015 from the comparable prior year period interest income decreased 07 million primarily due to lower late fee income interest expense increased 20 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our private placement facilities and our bank credit lines other net decreased by 47 million due primarily to a contractual payment in 2014 from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a nonexclusive sales model 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 26 2015 our effective tax rate was 293 compared to 304 for the prior year period during the third quarter of 2015 we received a favorable response to a tax petition which has allowed us to conclude that it is more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits which had been previously reserved will be realized as a result our provision for income taxes includes a 63 million income tax benefit 

absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26 2015 would have been 302 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 293 the remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense for 2016 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30 

net income 

net income increased 180 million or 36 for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above 

  

2014 compared to 2013 

net sales 

net sales for 2014 and 2013 were as follows in thousands 

 

the 8107 million or 85 increase in net sales for the year ended december 27 2014 includes an increase of 86 local currency growth 46 increase in internally generated revenue and 40 growth from acquisitions as well as a decrease of 01 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 3832 million or 77 increase in dental net sales for the year ended december 27 2014 includes an increase of 82 in local currencies 33 increase in internally generated revenue and 49 growth from acquisitions as well as a decrease of 05 related to foreign currency exchange the 82 increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 68 33 increase in internally generated revenue and 35 growth from acquisitions and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 87 33 increase in internally generated revenue and 54 growth from acquisitions 

the 2992 million or 115 increase in animal health net sales for the year ended december 27 2014 includes an increase of 112 local currency growth 63 increase in internally generated revenue and 49 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 03 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 995 million or 61 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december 27 2014 includes an increase of 60 local currency growth 59 increase in internally generated revenue and 01 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 01 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 288 million or 90 increase in technology and valueadded services net sales for the year ended december 27 2014 includes an increase of 88 local currency growth 57 increase in internally generated revenue and 31 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 02 related to foreign currency exchange 

  

gross profit 

gross profit and gross margins for 2014 and 2013 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

gross profit increased 2553 million or 96 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

health care distribution gross profit increased 2289 million or 93 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 267 for the year ended december 27 2014 from 265 for the comparable prior year period the slight overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit margin reflects stable margins in each of the segment’s operating units acquisitions accounted for 1615 million of our gross profit increase within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period the remaining increase of 674 million in our health care distribution segment gross profit was attributable to a 955 million gross profit increase from our growth in internally generated revenue partially offset by a 281 million gross profit decrease related to a slight decline in the gross margin rate primarily due to lower margins on our dental equipment and animal health sales 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 264 million or 129 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin increased to 662 for the year ended december 27 2014 from 640 for the comparable prior year period acquisitions accounted for 87 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period the remaining increase of 177 million in our technology and valueadded services segment gross profit was attributable to a 121 million gross profit increase from our growth in internally generated revenue and a 56 million gross profit increase related to improvements in the gross margin rate primarily due to changes in the product sales mix and higher margins on our electronic services revenues 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2014 and 2013 were as follows in thousands 

 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 2172 million or 110 for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period the 2077 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 27 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 1457 million additional costs from acquired companies and 620 million of additional operating costs the 95 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses within our technology and valueadded services segment for the year ended december 27 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to 57 million of additional costs from acquired companies and 38 million of additional operating costs as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to 212 from 207 for the comparable prior year period 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 1186 million or 93 for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses increased to 134 from 133 for the comparable prior year period 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 986 million or 139 for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased to 78 from 74 for the comparable prior year period 

other expense net 

other expense net for the years ended 2014 and 2013 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net decreased 65 million to 58 million for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period interest income increased 08 million interest expense decreased 35 million primarily due to the 62 million accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the early repayment of our henry schein animal health formerly butler schein animal health “hsah” debt during february 2013 partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our bank credit lines and our private placement facilities other net increased by 22 million due primarily to a contractual payment from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a nonexclusive sales model 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 27 2014 our effective tax rate was 304 compared to 287 for the prior year period during the third quarter of 2013 we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states which had been previously reserved will be realized as a result our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28 2013 included a 134 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards 

absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28 2013 would have been 307 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 287 the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense 

 

  

loss on sale of equity investment 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture 

net income 

net income increased 340 million or 72 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5868 million for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to 5925 million for the prior year the net change of 57 million was primarily attributable to unfavorable working capital changes partially offset by net income improvements 

net cash used in investing activities was 2600 million for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to 5166 million for the prior year the net change of 2566 million was primarily due to decreased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions and decreased purchases of fixed assets 

net cash used in financing activities was 3194 million for the year ended december 26 2015 compared to 1546 million for the prior year the net change of 1648 million was primarily due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

  

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations increased to 401 days as of december 26 2015 from 399 days as of december 27 2014 during the years ended december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 we wrote off approximately 80 million and 81 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from operations decreased to 55 as of december 26 2015 from 59 as of december 27 2014 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 22 as well as inventory purchase commitments and operating and capital lease obligations as of december 26 2015 

 

bank credit lines 

on september 12 2012 we entered into a new 500 million revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a 200 million expansion feature which was originally set to expire on september 12 2017 on september 22 2014 we extended the expiration date of the credit agreement to september 22 2019 the interest rate is based on the usd libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter the credit agreement provides among other things that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios and contains customary representations warranties and affirmative covenants the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants subject to negotiated exceptions on liens indebtedness significant corporate changes including mergers dispositions and certain restrictive agreements as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility were 400 million and 0 respectively as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 there were 114 million and 101 million of letters of credit respectively provided to third parties under the credit facility 

  

as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 we had various other shortterm bank credit lines available of which 2886 million and 1829 million respectively was outstanding at december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 121 and 126 respectively 

private placement facilities 

on august 10 2010 we entered into 400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies on april 30 2012 we increased our available credit facilities by 375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies on september 22 2014 we increased our available private placement facilities by 200 million to a total facility amount of 975 million and extended the expiration date to september 22 2017 these facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance from time to time through september 22 2017 the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years with an average life no longer than 12 years the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness andor to fund potential acquisitions the agreements provide among other things that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness liens affiliate transactions disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership these facilities contain makewhole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates 

the components of our private placement facility borrowings as of december 26 2015 are presented in the following table in thousands 

 

us trade accounts receivable securitization 

on april 17 2013 we entered into a facility agreement of up to 300 million with a bank as agent based on the securitization of our us trade accounts receivable this facility allowed us to replace public debt approximately 220 million which had a higher interest rate at hsah during february 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes the financing was structured as an assetbacked securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years on april 17 2015 we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 15 2018 the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were 900 million and 1500 million as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 respectively at december 26 2015 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 40 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 115 at december 27 2014 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 20 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 095 

  

we are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50 of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50 of the facility limit 

borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet 

henry schein animal health 

during february 2013 we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the hsah formerly butler schein animal health transaction using our existing credit agreement as part of this transaction we recorded a onetime interest expense charge of 62 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs 

longterm debt 

longterm debt consisted of the following 

 

divestiture of an equity affiliate 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture 

stock repurchases 

from june 21 2004 through december 26 2015 we repurchased approximately 17 billion or 21441511 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 400 million available as of december 26 2015 for future common stock share repurchases 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value accounting standards codification topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 26 2015 december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 931 million as of december 26 2015 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental animal health and medical consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

  

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental animal health and medical and technology and valueadded services goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis 

for the year ended december 26 2015 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a twostep approach the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units including goodwill to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss if any that we would record for such reporting unit the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill 

our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections 

 

  

for the years ended december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 we tested goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” which allowed us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we considered in developing our qualitative assessment included 

 

 

 

 

our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

for the years ended december 26 2015 december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

  

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award stockbased awards are provided to certain employees and nonemployee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan as amended and our 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan together the “plans” the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors prior to march 2009 awards under the plans principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations 

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions we issue restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting except for grants made under the 2015 nonemployee director stock incentive plan which are primarily 12month cliff vesting and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant 

the plans provide for adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures share repurchases and certain foreign exchange fluctuations over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

recently issued accounting standards 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201517 topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu 201517 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued the asu may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 201517 on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu 201503” asu 201503 requires that debt issuance costs be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability consistent with the presentation of debt discounts further asu 201503 requires the amortization of debt issuance costs to be reported as interest expense similarly debt issuance costs and any discount or premium are considered in the aggregate when determining the effective interest rate on the debt asu 201503 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years asu 201503 must be applied retrospectively entities may choose to adopt the new requirements as of an earlier date for financial statements that have not been previously issued we do not expect asu 201503 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201409” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states “us gaap” the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap 

in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201514” which deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period 

when effective asu 201409 will use either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 “simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” “asu 201516” asu 201516 removes the previous requirement for an acquiring company to restate prior period financial results due to measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 requires that an acquirer recognize provisional amounts that are identified during the measurementperiod in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined asu 201516 also requires presentation of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item either on the face of the income statement or within the notes to financial statements which would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date asu 201516 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period the guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 201516 on our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the company including its foreign subsidiaries may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure a hypothetical 5 change in the average value of the us dollar in 2015 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2015 reported net income attributable to henry schein inc by approximately 59 million 

as of december 26 2015 we had foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through january 17 2017 which include a marktomarket gain of 18 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 37 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties 

variable interest rate debt 

as of december 26 2015 we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our us trade accounts receivable securitization 

our revolving credit facility which we entered into on september 22 2014 and expires on september 22 2019 has an interest rate that is based on the us dollar libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter as of december 26 2015 there was 400 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility during the year ended december 26 2015 the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately 116 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would increase by 03 million 

our us trade accounts receivable securitization which we entered into on april 17 2013 and which expires on april 15 2018 has an interest rate that is based upon the assetbacked commercial paper rate of 40 basis points plus 75 basis points as of december 26 2015 we had an outstanding balance of 900 million under this securitization facility during the year ended december 26 2015 the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately 280 million based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points our interest expense thereunder would increase by 07 million

 item 9b other information 

plan of restructuring 

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities we have subsequently determined that the restructuring activities under this initiative will not be completed until the first half of fiscal 2016 

the total costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring are expected to be in the range of 41 million to 47 million pretax of which 349 million pretax were recorded during the year ended december 26 2015 these ongoing actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure to fund new initiatives to drive future growth under our 2015 – 2017 strategic planning cycle

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners we serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories animal health clinics and physician practices as well as government institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 82 years of experience distributing health care products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 17500 people of which approximately 8000 are based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 28 countries including the united states australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand poland portugal slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

we offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and valueadded solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care we operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 100000 branded products and henry schein private brand products in stock as well as more than 150000 additional products available as special order items we also offer our customers exclusive innovative technology solutions including practice management software and ecommerce solutions as well as a broad range of financial services 

we have established over four million square feet of space in 65 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2014 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental animal health and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the dental market our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc our primary competitor in the medical market is mckesson corporation which is a national distributor we also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks and allscripts healthcare solutions inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services centaur services limited and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand poland portugal slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

  

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

  

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2014 and 2024 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2014 and 2034 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 23 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2014 and 2024 and approximately 15 between 2014 and 2034 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

 

governmental regulations 

operating security and licensure standards 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the united states federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products 

the fdc act as amended by the drug quality and security act of 2013 establishes certain requirements with respect to the pharmaceutical supply chain including with respect to product tracing the licensure and operations of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers “3pls” and the preemption of state law at the federal level pursuant to the fdc act the fda has generally required wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of a prescription drug which is the record that tracks the chain of ownership of a prescription drug as it is distributed through the united states pharmaceutical supply chain over the last several years many states have also implemented or proposed their own prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations which were intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain this created a patchwork of state licensing and drug pedigree ie track and trace requirements 

the drug quality and security act of 2013 brings about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” will be phased in over 10 years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law began to take effect in january 2015 and on that date specific product tracing requirements for manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect although the fda in a final guidance issued on december 23 2014 stated that in order to minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of prescription drugs in the united states it would not take action for noncompliance with these track and trace requirements prior to may 1 2015 these new product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements also in january 2015 the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a “suspect” or “illegitimate” product and handle it accordingly 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and 3pls and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs wholesalers and 3pls are also required to submit annual reports to the fda beginning on january 1 2015 which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa in addition the fda is required to issue guidance and hold public meetings regarding the implementation of the dscsa’s track and trace requirements over the course of the next few years the fda has begun this process including by holding a public workshop in may 2014 and issuing various guidance documents including regarding suspect products product tracing requirements annual reporting to the fda and the effect of the law’s preemption provisions we are in the process of analyzing the impact of the dscsa on our business 

  

the fdc act also requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid and other technologies the fda has also continued to develop its policies with respect to the integrity of the supply chain by issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and a final rule in 2013 for a unique medical device identification system to be phased in over seven years that will require most medical devices distributed in the united states to carry a unique device identifier the dscsa also addresses product tracing using unique product identifiers on packaging and may affect previously issued fda guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers the dscsa and its forthcoming implementing regulations may affect previously issued fda guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the dea 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue we are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign powers furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions there have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government globally to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

  

 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the united states government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance we had discussions with the government regarding certain of our marketing practices and have concluded such discussions in a manner that is not material to the company in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the “health care reform law” discussed in more detail in health care reform below on september 30 2014 the general public and government officials were provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs we also are subject to foreign regulations pertaining to financial relationships between suppliers and physicians dentist and other customers 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could adversely affect our business 

health care reform 

the united states health care reform law also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to increase access to health coverage some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses in particular a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports were due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms published information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities on september 30 2014 

  

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope cms commentary on the final rule and more recent cms communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements in addition certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices accordingly we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain of such state laws in addition to physician payment sunshine act reporting and some of these state laws are also ambiguous we completed the initial physician payment sunshine act submission to cms due march 31 2014 covering the period august 1 to december 31 2013 beginning in 2014 and each year thereafter data collection for each calendar year must be submitted by march 31 of the subsequent year we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements and similar foreign requirements our compliance with the new final rule and similar foreign requirements imposes additional costs on us 

on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014 or to pay a penalty however the decision also invalidated a provision in the health care reform law requiring states in 2014 to expand their medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal medicaid funding the court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement but that it may not take away preexisting medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion almost half the states have not yet accepted the medicaid expansion so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the health care reform law is uncertain subsequent litigation has focused on whether the health care reform law permits the use of health insurance subsidies for low and moderate income individuals who purchase coverage through the health insurance exchanges established by the federal government in most states the health insurance exchanges are established by the federal government not the state itself and federal courts have issued contradictory rulings on this matter the united states supreme court has agreed to hear a case in which a federal appeals court upheld the subsidies for federal health insurance exchanges the supreme court is expected to issue a ruling by the end of june 2015 and if the subsidies are held to be unavailable through federal health insurance exchanges this might significantly limit the application of the health care reform law adding to this uncertainty in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing health care reform the white house and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays such as regarding the “employer mandate” with respect to the employer mandate starting in 2015 employers with 100 or more fulltime employees must generally provide certain health insurance to their workforce or pay specified fines while starting in 2016 the requirement will apply to employers with 50 or more fulltime employees 

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or comparable foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches 

 

  

failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule was required by september 23 2013 and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition federal initiatives including in particular the hitech act are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the hitech initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” in accordance with applicable requirements with respect to recognizing “certified” ehr technology cms regulations reference an older “2011 edition certified technology” which is to be replaced by a newer “2014 edition certified technology” in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 this reduction is subject to a grant of a “hardship” exemption by cms which generally permits providers to avoid medicare reimbursement reductions where they can show that demonstrating meaningful use of ehr would result in a significant hardship qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage 2” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists 

recognizing difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms published a final rule on september 4 2014 that adds flexibility to the manner in which physicians dentists and others may demonstrate meaningful use of ehr by extending through the 2014 reporting period the ability in certain circumstances to use 2011 editioncertified technology to attest to meaningful use rather than requiring the use of 2014 editioncertified technology the rule also delays for one year implementation of more rigorous “stage 3” measures and under this rule eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists would begin stage 3 in calendar year 2017 in addition also in recognition of difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms has specifically recognized that a hardship exemption may be granted among other reasons where the provider’s failure to demonstrate meaningful use was caused by its ehr vendor’s failure to timely obtain 2014 certification for its ehr technology and extended the deadline for health care professionals to file hardship exemption applications from july 1 2014 to november 30 2014 on january 29 2015 cms announced an intent to engage in further rulemaking under the ehr incentive program to redress the stage 2 reporting burden on providers among other things the new rule expected in the spring of 2015 will tie ehr reporting to a calendar year modify other aspects of the program and shorten the ehr reporting period in 2015 to 90 days certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with and are affected by these evolving governmental criteria 

  

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 and cms delayed the implementation date until october 1 2014 but as part of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 enacted on april 1 2014 congress prohibited the secretary of health and human services from implementing icd10cm any earlier than october 1 2015 cms published a final rule on august 4 2014 adopting the october 1 2015 compliance date and requiring the use of icd9cm code sets through september 30 2015 and there is no suggestion that implementation will be further delayed certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

international transactions 

in addition united states and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among health care product distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

 

  

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

 

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

uncertain global macroeconomic and political conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties including among other things sovereign debt levels the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues consumer confidence unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population interest rates availability of capital fuel and energy costs tax rates health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall additionally recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

 

  

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and in the case of animal health practitioners changes in the use of feed additives including without limitation antibiotics and growth promotants used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions animal welfare andor government regulations and changes in customer buying habits including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians’ offices if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of significant health care reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the implementation of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely and the health care reform law may be invalidated in whole or in part or it may be repealed additionally further federal and state proposals for health care reform in the united states are likely and foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

 

  

 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and we timely filed our first disclosure reports on june 30 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms published information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities on september 30 2014 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope cms commentary on the final rule and more recent cms communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements in addition certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices accordingly we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws in addition to physician payment sunshine act reporting and some of these state laws are also ambiguous we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements and similar foreign requirements our compliance with the new final rule and similar foreign requirements imposes additional costs on us 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products and animal feed and supplements among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to federal and state and similar foreign laws and regulations relating to health care fraud some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law discussed in more detail under “government regulations  health care reform” above the general public and government officials are being provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

the applicable requirements have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years also significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and under the federal false claims act can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

 

  

 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

failure to comply with health care fraud laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including without limitation securities antitrust and marketing laws and regulations failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur penalties or other liabilities 

state federal and foreign laws such as hipaa regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released these measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers these also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply in addition under the hitech act which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule was required by september 23 2013 and increased the requirements applicable to some of our businesses failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

in addition federal initiatives are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use ehr in accordance with applicable requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage 2” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists 

 

  

recognizing difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms published a final rule on september 4 2014 that adds flexibility to the manner in which physicians dentists and others may demonstrate meaningful use of ehr by extending through the 2014 reporting period the ability in certain circumstances to use 2011 editioncertified technology to attest to meaningful use rather than requiring the use of 2014 editioncertified technology the rule also delays for one year implementation of more rigorous “stage 3” measures and under this rule eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists would begin stage 3 in calendar year 2017 as to which regulations are to be proposed in spring 2015 in addition also in recognition of difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms has specifically recognized that a hardship exemption may be granted among other reasons where the provider’s failure to demonstrate meaningful use was caused by its ehr vendor’s failure to timely obtain 2014 certification for its ehr technology and extended the deadline for health care professionals to file hardship exemption applications from july 1 2014 to november 30 2014 on january 29 2015 cms announced an intent to engage in further rulemaking under the ehr incentive program to redress the stage 2 reporting burden on providers among other things the new rule expected in the spring of 2015 will tie ehr reporting to a calendar year modify other aspects of the program and shorten the ehr reporting period in 2015 to 90 days certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and the failure to maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition the frequently changing requirements may increase our costs in these businesses

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 17500 people of which approximately 8000 are based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 28 countries including the united states australia austria belgium brazil canada chile china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand poland portugal slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

 

  

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment distributes consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2014 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2014 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 18 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 60 during the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states we believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating economic and industry conditions the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20132023” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 29 trillion in 2013 or 172 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 52 trillion in 2023 approximately 193 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance in addition our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance including securities antitrust and other laws and regulations failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

health care reform 

the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage 

the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales the healthcare reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance however litigation is pending including before the supreme court of the united states which could result in the invalidation of some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted and the reduction in the expansion of health insurance coverage there has also been an effort by the party in control of congress to repeal some or all of the law the uncertain status of the healthcare reform law affects our ability to plan 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports were due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms published information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities on september 30 2014 

under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain of such state laws in addition to physician payment sunshine act reporting and some of these state laws are also ambiguous we completed the initial physician payment sunshine act submission to cms due march 31 2014 covering the period august 1 to december 31 2013 which was released to the public september 1 2014 beginning from 2014 and each year thereafter data collection for each calendar year must be submitted by march 31 of the subsequent year we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements and similar foreign requirements our compliance with the new final rule and similar foreign requirements imposes additional costs on us 

 

  

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the united states government among others has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance 

we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse effect on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

operating and security standards 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state 

 

  

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brings about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” will be phased in over 10 years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the law began to take effect in january 2015 and on that date specific product tracing requirements for manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs took effect although the fda in a final guidance issued on december 23 2014 stated that in order to minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of prescription drugs in the united states it would not take action for noncompliance with these track and trace requirements prior to may 1 2015 these new product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and preempt state requirements that are inconsistent with more stringent than or in addition to the dscsa requirements also in january 2015 the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a “suspect” or “illegitimate” product and handle it accordingly 

the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers “3pls” and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs wholesalers and 3pls are also required to submit annual reports to the fda beginning on january 1 2015 which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information according to fda guidance states are preempted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with less stringent than directly related to or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa 

we are in the process of analyzing the impact of the dscsa on our business 

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has developed policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities 

in addition federal initiatives are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” in accordance with applicable requirements in addition medicareeligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet “meaningful use” requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions which reductions for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists began on january 1 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage 1” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage 2” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists 

  

recognizing difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms published a final rule on september 4 2014 that adds flexibility to the manner in which physicians dentists and others may demonstrate meaningful use of ehr by extending through the 2014 reporting period the ability in certain circumstances to use 2011 editioncertified technology to attest to meaningful use rather than requiring the use of 2014 editioncertified technology the rule also delays for one year implementation of more rigorous “stage 3” measures and under this rule eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists would begin stage 3 in calendar year 2017 as to which regulations are to be proposed in spring 2015 in addition also in recognition of difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 editioncertified ehr technology cms has specifically recognized that a hardship exemption may be granted among other reasons where the provider’s failure to demonstrate meaningful use was caused by its ehr vendor’s failure to timely obtain 2014 certification for its ehr technology and extended the deadline for health care professionals to file hardship exemption applications from july 1 2014 to november 30 2014 on january 29 2015 cms announced an intent to engage in further rulemaking under the ehr incentive program to redress the stage 2 reporting burden on providers among other things the new rule expected in the spring of 2015 will tie ehr reporting to a calendar year modify other aspects of the program and shorten the ehr reporting period in 2015 to 90 days certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with and are affected by these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 and cms delayed the implementation date until october 1 2014 but as part of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 enacted on april 1 2014 congress prohibited the secretary of health and human services from implementing icd10cm any earlier than october 1 2015 cms published a final rule on august 4 2014 adopting the october 1 2015 compliance date and requiring the use of icd9cm code sets through september 30 2015 and there is no suggestion that implementation will be further delayed certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care 

ecommerce 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets

plans of restructuring 

 

on november 6 2014 we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies which will occur throughout fiscal 2015 this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2 to 3 of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities the costs associated with all actions to complete this restructuring are expected to be in the range of 35 million to 40 million pretax approximately 029 to 033 per diluted share we plan to reduce our cost structure to fund new initiatives to drive future growth as our 2015 – 2017 strategic planning cycle begins at this time we are unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts to be included for each major type of cost associated with this restructuring including associated cash expenditures we will provide further details in a future securities and exchange commission filing at such time as we are able to determine the costs we expect to incur in connection with this restructuring 

 

the costs associated with this restructuring will be included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income 

during the year ended december 29 2012 we incurred restructuring costs of approximately 152 million approximately 105 million after taxes consisting of employee severance pay and benefits related to the elimination of approximately 200 positions facility closing costs representing primarily lease terminations and asset writeoff costs and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan this restructuring program is complete and we do not expect any additional costs from this program

gross profit 

gross profit and gross margins for 2014 and 2013 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

gross profit increased 2553 million or 96 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

health care distribution gross profit increased 2289 million or 93 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 267 for the year ended december 27 2014 from 265 for the comparable prior year period the slight increase in our health care distribution gross profit margin reflects stable margins in each of the segment’s operating units 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 264 million or 129 for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin increased to 662 for the year ended december 27 2014 from 640 for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 1186 million or 93 for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses increased to 134 from 133 for the comparable prior year period

other expense net decreased 65 million to 58 million for the year ended december 27 2014 from the comparable prior year period interest income increased 08 million interest expense decreased 35 million primarily due to the 62 million accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the early repayment of our henry schein animal health “hsah” debt during february 2013 partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our bank credit lines and our private placement facilities other net increased by 22 million due primarily to a contractual payment from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a nonexclusive sales model 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 27 2014 our effective tax rate was 304 compared to 287 for the prior year period during the third quarter of 2013 we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states which had been previously reserved will be realized as a result our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28 2013 included a 134 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards 

absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28 2013 would have been 307 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 287 the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense for 2015 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30 

loss on sale of equity investment 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture

income taxes 

for the year ended december 28 2013 our effective tax rate was 287 compared to 311 for the prior year period during the third quarter of 2013 we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states which had been previously reserved will be realized as a result our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28 2013 included a 134 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards

net income 

net income increased 481 million or 114 for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5925 million for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to 6642 million for the prior year the net change of 717 million was primarily attributable to unfavorable working capital changes partially offset by net income improvements the prior year’s change in working capital was favorably affected by reductions in inventory related to the medical device excise tax 

net cash used in investing activities was 5166 million for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to 2666 million for the prior year the net change of 2500 million was primarily due to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions and increased purchases of fixed assets 

net cash used in financing activities was 1546 million for the year ended december 27 2014 compared to 3360 million for the prior year the net change of 1814 million was primarily due to decreased net payments for longterm debt partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 

 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations decreased to 399 days as of december 27 2014 from 400 days as of december 28 2013 during the years ended december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 we wrote off approximately 81 million and 83 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from operations remained constant at 59 as of december 27 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions

us trade accounts receivable securitization 

on april 17 2013 we entered into a facility agreement of up to 300 million with a bank as agent based on the securitization of our us trade accounts receivable the new facility allowed us to replace public debt approximately 220 million which had a higher interest rate at hsah during february 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes the financing was structured as an assetbacked securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years on september 22 2014 we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 15 2017 the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were 1500 million as of december 27 2014 at december 27 2014 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the average assetbacked commercial paper rate of 20 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 095

henry schein animal health 

during february 2013 we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the hsah formerly butler schein animal health transaction using our existing credit agreement as part of this transaction we recorded a onetime interest expense charge of 62 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs 

longterm debt 

longterm debt consisted of the following 

 

divestiture of an equity affiliate 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture 

stock repurchases 

from june 21 2004 through december 27 2014 we repurchased approximately 14 billion or 19357214 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 2999 million available as of december 27 2014 for future common stock share repurchases 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value accounting standards codification topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 27 2014 december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 are presented in the following table 

 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 806 million as of december 27 2014 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental animal health and medical consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped or made available to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

  

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental animal health and medical and technology and valueadded services 

we test goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment include 

 

 

 

 

goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for certain indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

  

for the years ended december 27 2014 december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stockunits since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stockunits with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimated the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which required us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

grants of restricted stockunits are stockbased awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions in the case of restricted stock common stock is delivered on the date of grant subject to vesting conditions in the case of restricted stock units common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions prior to february 2014 we issued restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting since february 2014 we have issued restricted stockunits that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting under our 2013 stock incentive plan and primarily 13month cliff vesting under our 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and restricted stockunits that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting under our 2013 stock incentive plan 

 

  

with respect to timebased restricted stockunits we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stockunits the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stockunits based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stockunits targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures share repurchases and certain foreign exchange fluctuations over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

recently issued accounting standards 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201409” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states “us gaap” the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap 

the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods therein using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 27 2014 we have foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through july 29 2015 which include a marktomarket gain of 12 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by a reduction 01 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners we serve more than 800000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories animal health clinics and physician practices as well as government institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 81 years of experience distributing health care products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 16000 people of which more than 7000 are based outside the united states and have operations or affiliates in 25 countries including the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy luxembourg mauritius the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

we offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and valueadded solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care we operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 96000 branded products and henry schein private brand products in stock as well as more than 110000 additional products available as special order items we also offer our customers exclusive innovative technology solutions including practice management software and ecommerce solutions as well as a broad range of financial services 

we have established over four million square feet of space in 61 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental animal health and medical operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners dental laboratories schools and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services as well as continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2013 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental animal health and medical products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc which are national distributors we also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the nextgen division of quality systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts healthcare solutions inc and athenahealth inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co lifco ab planmeca oy billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar iceland ireland israel italy luxembourg mauritius the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia south africa spain switzerland thailand and the united kingdom 

  

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental animal health and medical practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

  

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2013 and 2023 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12 between 2013 and 2033 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 8 between 2013 and 2023 and approximately 15 between 2013 and 2033 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

operating security and licensure standards 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s “fda” regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products 

the fdc act also establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance the newly enacted drug quality and security act of 2013 which was signed into law by president obama on november 27 2013 amends the fdc act with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law the drug quality and security act provides that over the next 10 years the fda will implement a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the united states drug enforcement administration permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the fda the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue the united states drug enforcement administration the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions there have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 

  

the drug quality and security act preempts state pedigree laws and requires certain entities in the pharmaceutical supply chain including prescription drug wholesalers to provide a paper or electronic pedigree beginning by january 1 2015 in addition this law mandates that an interoperable electronic pedigree system be implemented within ten years of the law’s enactment the fda is required to issue guidance and hold public meetings regarding the implementation of the pedigree requirements over the course of the next few years 

until the pedigree provisions of the drug quality and security act begin to take effect in january 2015 current federal law in this area continues to be effective and preempts state law the fdc act currently requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs which pedigree must include an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug currently the fda in the exercise of its enforcement discretion requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs 

the fdc act also requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid and other technologies the fda has continued to develop its policies in this area such as issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and issuing a final rule in september 2013 for a unique medical device identification system to be phased in over seven years that will require most medical devices distributed in the united states to carry a unique device identifier the newly enacted drug quality and security act and its forthcoming implementing regulations may affect previously issued fda guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers 

over the last several years many states have implemented or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain this created a patchwork of state wholesale distributor licensing and drug pedigree ie track and trace requirements bills have been proposed in congress that more comprehensively address the security of the drug supply chain including track and trace systems title ii of the drug quality and security act known as the drug supply chain security act will be phased in by the fda over 10 years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the drug supply chain security act provides specific track and trace requirements for manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs and requires manufacturers and wholesale distributors by january 1 2015 to have in place a system by which they can identify a product in their possession or control that is a “suspect product” and to meet product tracing requirements 

the law also sets requirements for the licensing and operation of wholesalers and third party logistics “3pl” providers and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities wholesalers and 3pls would also be required to submit annual reports to the fda beginning on january 1 2015 which would include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information 

significantly the drug supply chain security act beginning on its enactment date also preempts similar state laws thus apparently rendering unenforceable in whole or in part state drug pedigree laws that have already been implemented it also requires that prescription drug wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping storage and handling of prescription drugs while the drug supply chain security act preempts state requirements in this area the extent to which it preempts state requirements is unclear the fda is expected to issue additional guidance and regulations to clarify these requirements in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel for example florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug from distributors and potentially back to the manufacturers california enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as rfid technologies the california law was to take effect on a staggered basis commencing on january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers we are in the process of analyzing the impact of the drug supply chain security act on our business 

  

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these lawsreferred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance we had discussions with the government regarding certain of our marketing practices and have concluded such discussions in a manner that is not material to the company in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the “health care reform law” discussed in more detail in health care reform below by september 30 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could adversely affect our business 

 

  

health care reform 

the health care reform law also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to increase access to health coverage some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses in particular a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities which according to cms will be available to the public by september 30 2014 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope cms commentary on the final rule and more recent cms communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements in addition certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices accordingly we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us 

on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014 or to pay a penalty however the decision also invalidated a provision in the health care reform law requiring states in 2014 to expand their medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal medicaid funding the court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement but that it may not take away preexisting medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion almost half the states have not yet accepted the medicaid expansion so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the health care reform law is uncertain adding to this uncertainty in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing health care reform the white house and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays such as regarding the “employer mandate” that generally requires employers with 50 or more full time employees to provide certain health insurance to those employees or pay specified fines 

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches 

  

  

 

failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule was required by september 23 2013 and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition federal initiatives including in particular the hitech act are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the hitech initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage one” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms had also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists cms has indicated that it will delay rulemaking on more rigorous “stage three” criteria until 2014 and has stated that it will delay implementation of stage three measures until 2017 certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 but cms issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until october 1 2014 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

international transactions 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among health care products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell additionally because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda to meet these requirements could result in product recall cessation of sales or other market disruptions in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products especially any high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties including among other things sovereign debt levels the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues consumer confidence unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population interest rates availability of capital fuel and energy costs tax rates health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall additionally recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sale we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

 

  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of significant health care reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the implementation of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely additionally further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold for example i where we purchase medical devices from thirdparty manufacturers the manufacturers may increase their prices to cover their payment of the excise tax and our costs to purchase such medical devices may therefore increase and ii where we manufacture medical devices or are the importer of record our cost of goods sold have increased because we are subject to paying the excise tax 

 

  

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities which according to cms will be available to the public by september 30 2014 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope cms commentary on the final rule and more recent cms communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements in addition certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices accordingly we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the fda and united states drug enforcement administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to federal and state and similar foreign laws and regulations relating to health care fraud some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law by september 30 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

the applicable requirements have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years also significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and under the federal false claims act can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

 

  

failure to comply with health care fraud laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur penalties or other liabilities 

state federal and foreign laws such as hipaa regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released these measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers these also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply in addition under the hitech act which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule was required by september 23 2013 and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

we may experience competition from thirdparty online commerce sites 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional valueadded services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business

failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive customer data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could also expose us to claims fines and penalties and costs for remediation additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental animal health and medical markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 45 billion in 2013 in the global markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

 

  

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2013 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to triple to approximately 18 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 70 during the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20122022” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 28 trillion in 2012 or 179 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 50 trillion in 2022 approximately 199 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical devices andor medical treatments or services also many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance 

health care reform 

for example the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage the health care reform law requirements include a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty however the decision also invalidated a provision in the health care reform law requiring states in 2014 to expand their medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal medicaid funding the court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement but that it may not take away preexisting medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion almost half the states have not yet accepted the medicaid expansion so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the health care reform law is uncertain adding to this uncertainty in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing health care reform the white house and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays such as regarding the “employer mandate” that generally requires employers with 50 or more full time employees to provide certain health insurance to those employees or pay specified fines 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act under this rule data collection activities began on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 as required under the physician payment sunshine act cms will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities which according to cms will be available to the public by september 30 2014 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope cms commentary on the final rule and more recent cms communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements in addition certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices accordingly we will be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us 

 

  

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law discussed in more detail under “health care reform” above by september 30 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which includes us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws could adversely affect our business 

operating and security standards 

at the federal level the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdc act requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs which includes an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug   until the pedigree provisions of the drug quality and security act begin to take effect in january 2015 current federal law in this area continues to be effective and preempts state law currently the united states food and drug administration or fda in exercise of its enforcement discretion requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates 

 

  

 

names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs the fda has continued to develop its policies regarding the integrity of the supply chain such as by issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and by issuing a final rule in 2013 for a unique medical device identification system to be phased in over seven years that will require most medical devices distributed in the united states to carry a unique device identifier the new requirements of the drug quality and security act may affect previously issued fda guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers 

over the last several years many states have implemented or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain this created a patchwork of state wholesale distributor licensing and drug pedigree ie track and trace requirements bills have been proposed in congress that more comprehensively address the security of the drug supply chain including track and trace systems one important federal measure the drug quality and security act of 2013 was signed into law by president obama on november 27 2013 title ii of this measure known as the drug supply chain security act will be phased in by the fda over 10 years and is intended to build a national electronic interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states the drug supply chain security act provides specific track and trace requirements for manufacturers wholesalers repackagers and dispensers eg pharmacies of prescription drugs and requires manufacturers and wholesale distributers by january 1 2015 to have in place a system by which they can identify a product in their possession or control that is a “suspect product” and to meet product tracing requirements 

the law also sets requirements for the licensing and operation of wholesalers and third party logistics “3pl” providers and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities wholesalers and 3pls would also be required to submit annual reports to the fda beginning on january 1 2015 which would include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed the name and address of each facility and contact information 

significantly under the drug supply chain security act beginning on its enactment date the act preempts similar state laws thus apparently rendering unenforceable in whole or in part state drug pedigree laws that have already been implemented over the past few years there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabelled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system a number of states have implemented pedigree requirements including drug tracking requirements which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system a number of states including florida have already implemented pedigree requirements including drug tracking requirements which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system california has enacted a statute that beginning in 2015 was intended to require manufacturers to identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard machinereadable unique numerical identifier and to require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic trackandtrace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain the california law was to take effect on a staggered basis commencing on january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers we are in the process of analyzing the impact of the drug supply chain security act to our business 

the federal controlled substances act also regulates wholesale distribution of controlled substances and certain chemicals the combat methamphetamine enhancement act of 2010 which became effective in april 2011 requires retail sellers of products containing certain chemicals such as pseudoephedrine to selfcertify to the drug enforcement administration “dea” that they understand and agree to comply with the laws and regulations regarding such sales the law also prohibits distributors from selling these products to retailers who are not registered with the dea or who have not selfcertified compliance with the laws and regulations various states also impose restrictions on the sale of certain products containing pseudoephedrine and other chemicals the secure and responsible drug disposal act of 2010 signed by president obama in october 2010 is intended to allow patients to deliver unused controlled substances to designated entities to more easily and safely dispose of controlled substances while reducing the chance of diversion the law authorizes the dea to promulgate regulations to allow but not require designated entities to receive unused controlled substances 

 

  

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was enacted in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly affected by federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule was required by september 23 2013 and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition federal initiatives including in particular the hitech act are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the hitech initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage one” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals including physicians and dentists and has indicated that it will delay rulemaking on more rigorous “stage three” criteria until 2014 and has stated that it will delay implementation of stage three measures until 2017 certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 but cms recently issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until october 1 2014 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care 

 

  

ecommerce 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets 

results of operations 

the following tables summarize the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december 28 2013 december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 in thousands 

 

plans of restructuring 

during the year ended december 29 2012 we incurred restructuring costs of approximately 152 million approximately 105 million after taxes consisting of employee severance pay and benefits related to the elimination of approximately 200 positions facility closing costs representing primarily lease terminations and asset writeoff costs and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan this restructuring program is complete and we do not expect any additional costs from this program 

  

2013 compared to 2012 

net sales 

net sales for 2013 and 2012 were as follows in thousands 

 

beginning with the first quarter of 2012 we have reported net sales and prioryear sales comparisons for each of our global dental animal health and medical and global technology and valueadded services business groups 

this sales reporting is consistent with our global business groups as realigned in 2012 these groups were formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective as well as global product and service offerings and best practices 

we will continue to report financial results for our health care distribution and technology and valueadded services reportable segments the health care distribution segment comprises three global operating segments dental animal health and medical and the technology and valueadded services segment remains unchanged 

the 6207 million or 69 increase in net sales for the year ended december 28 2013 includes an increase of 68 local currency growth 36 increase in internally generated revenue and 32 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 01 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 2235 million or 47 increase in dental net sales for the year ended december 28 2013 includes an increase of 43 in local currencies 21 increase in internally generated revenue and 22 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 04 related to foreign currency exchange the 43 increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 36 30 increase in internally generated revenue and 06 growth from acquisitions and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 45 18 increase in internally generated revenue and 27 growth from acquisitions 

the 2783 million or 120 increase in animal health net sales for the year ended december 28 2013 includes an increase of 123 local currency growth 55 increase in internally generated revenue and 68 growth from acquisitions as well as a decrease of 03 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 822 million or 53 increase in medical net sales for the year ended december 28 2013 includes an increase of 51 local currency growth 46 increase in internally generated revenue and 05 growth from acquisitions as well as an increase of 02 related to foreign currency exchange 

the 366 million or 129 increase in technology and valueadded services net sales for the year ended december 28 2013 includes an increase of 133 local currency growth 95 increase in internally generated revenue and 38 growth from acquisitions as well as a decrease of 04 related to foreign currency exchange 

  

gross profit 

gross profit and gross margins for 2013 and 2012 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

gross profit increased 1485 million or 59 for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

  

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

health care distribution gross profit increased 1274 million or 55 for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 265 for the year ended december 28 2013 from 268 for the comparable prior year period the decrease in our health care distribution gross profit margin is primarily due to growth in sales within our animal health businesses which typically include a greater percentage of lowermargin pharmaceutical products than our other operating units 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 211 million or 115 for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin decreased to 640 for the year ended december 28 2013 from 648 for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2013 and 2012 were as follows in thousands 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1056 million or 56 for the year ended december 28 2013 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 207 from 210 for the comparable prior year period 

  

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased 704 million or 59 for the year ended december 28 2013 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales selling expenses decreased to 133 from 135 for the comparable prior year period 

as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 352 million or 52 for the year ended december 28 2013 from the comparable prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased to 74 from 75 for the comparable prior year period 

other expense net 

other expense net for the years ended 2013 and 2012 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net decreased 24 million to 124 million for the year ended december 28 2013 from the comparable prior year period interest income decreased 05 million primarily due to lower investment income interest expense decreased 34 million primarily due to a reduction in borrowings under our henry schein animal health “hsah” debt partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our private placement facilities and increased borrowings based on the securitization of our us trade accounts receivable other net decreased by 04 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 28 2013 our effective tax rate was 287 compared to 311 for the prior year period during the third quarter of 2013 we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states which had been previously reserved will be realized as a result our provision for income taxes includes a 134 million reduction of the valuation allowance which is based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards 

absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28 2013 would have been 307 as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 287 the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense for 2014 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30 

loss on sale of equity investment 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there is no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture 

net income 

net income increased 481 million or 114 for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above 

  

2012 compared to 2011

other expense net 

other expense net for the years ended 2012 and 2011 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net increased 19 million to 148 million for the year ended december 29 2012 from the comparable prior year period interest income decreased 22 million primarily due to lower investment income interest expense increased 05 million primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our private placement facilities and our bank credit lines partially offset by lower interest expense due to a reduction in borrowings under our hsah debt other net increased by 08 million due primarily to a gain related to an increase in the fair value of an equity affiliate which is now being reported as a consolidated entity beginning in the third quarter of 2012 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 29 2012 our effective tax was 311 compared to 317 for the prior year period the net reduction in our 2012 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense 

net income 

net income increased 187 million or 46 for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6642 million for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to 4081 million for the prior year the net change of 2561 million was primarily attributable to net income improvements and favorable working capital changes attributable to inventory buyins that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 in advance of potential price increases related to the medical device excise tax 

net cash used in investing activities was 2666 million for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to 2696 million for the prior year the net change of 30 million was primarily due to decreased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions partially offset by increased purchases of fixed assets payments made related to a sale of an equity investment and reduced proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities 

net cash used in financing activities was 3360 million for the year ended december 28 2013 compared to 1706 million for the prior year the net change of 1654 million was primarily due to increased net payments for longterm debt and decreased proceeds from issuance of stock upon exercise of stock options 

 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity

private placement facilities 

on august 10 2010 we entered into 400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies on april 30 2012 we increased our available credit facilities by 375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies these facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance from time to time during a three year issuance period through april 26 2015 the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years with an average life no longer than 12 years the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness andor to fund potential acquisitions the agreements provide among other things that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness liens affiliate transactions disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership these facilities contain makewhole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates

henry schein animal health 

during the first quarter of 2013 we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the hsah transaction using our existing credit agreement as part of this transaction we recorded a onetime interest expense charge of 62 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs 

us trade accounts receivable securitization 

on april 17 2013 we entered into a facility agreement of up to 300 million with a bank as agent based on the securitization of our us trade accounts receivable the new facility allowed us to replace public debt approximately 220 million which had a higher interest rate at hsah during february 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes the financing was structured as an assetbacked securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were 1600 million as of december 28 2013 at december 28 2013 the interest rate on borrowings under this facility is based on the average assetbacked commercial paper rate of 21 basis points plus 75 basis points for a combined rate of 096 

we are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if usage is greater than or equal to 50 of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if usage is less than 50 of the facility limit 

borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet 

 

  

divestiture of an equity affiliate 

on july 10 2013 we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors the divestiture resulted in a onetime loss of 125 million or 014 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 pursuant to the terms of this divestiture we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of 134 million which it was required to use to reduce its debt pay certain trade payables and provide working capital the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012 there is no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture 

stock repurchases 

from june 21 2004 through december 28 2013 we repurchased 11 billion or 16829005 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 3000 million available as of december 28 2013 for future common stock share repurchases 

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 28 2013 december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

on december 30 2011 we acquired all of oak hill capital partners’ “ohcp” remaining direct and indirect interests in butler animal health supply “bahs” including its interest in wa butler company for 155 million in cash as a result of this transaction our ownership in bahs increased to approximately 717 at december 31 2011 the amount paid to ohcp for their remaining interests in bahs was in excess of the previously agreed upon annual limits see note 9 “business acquisitions and other transaction” within our notes to our consolidated financial statements but such limits were waived by all parties involved at december 28 2013 our ownership in bahs is approximately 744 

 

  

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 541 million as of december 28 2013 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental animal health and medical consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service effective december 26 2010 we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

  

 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental animal health and medical and technology and valueadded services 

we test goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” “asu 201108” which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment included 

 

 

 

 

goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for certain indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

 

  

  

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

beginning with the first quarter of 2012 we changed our reporting units from dental animal health medical international and technology to global dental global animal health global medical and global technology and valueadded services 

these groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective as well as global product and service offerings and best practices 

in connection with this change in business groups goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units based upon this change we felt it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment in addition to a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter for the year ended december 29 2012 in order to establish a new baseline calculation 

based on a qualitative analysis there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through december 28 2013 that impacted our analysis for the years ended december 28 2013 december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units with the exception of stock options for certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimated the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which required us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting 

 

  

 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures and share repurchases over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 28 2013 the net notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through july 30 2014 was 93 million which includes a marktomarket gain of 01 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by an additional 01 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

we conduct our business through two reportable segments i health care distribution and ii technology and valueadded services these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 

the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental medical and animal health operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our global dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions our global medical group serves officebased medical practitioners ambulatory surgery centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics 

our global technology and valueadded services group provides software technology and other valueadded services to health care practitioners our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our valueadded practice solutions include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices practice technology network and hardware services plus continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 30 billion in 2012 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

 

  

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are mckesson corp pss world medical inc and cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the patterson veterinary supply division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc and athenahealth inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the patterson veterinary supply division of patterson companies inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy arseus nv billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland thailand turkey and the united kingdom 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 

 

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a global valueadded provider of health care products and services to officebased dental medical and animal health care practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using health care services between 2012 and 2022 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 13 between 2012 and 2032 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 26 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 9 between 2012 and 2022 and approximately 18 between 2012 and 2032 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases there is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity and this is being driven in the us by lower insurance reimbursement rates at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

the animal health market impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care as well increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us we support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals pharmaceuticals supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software 

additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

 

operating security and licensure standards 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products 

the fdc act also establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations from the united states drug enforcement administration permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations furthermore compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

  

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel for example florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug from distributors and potentially back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies the law will take effect on a staggered basis commencing on january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 

at the federal level the fdc act requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs which includes an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug currently the united states food and drug administration in the exercise of its enforcement discretion requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs 

the fdc act also requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration has continued to develop its policies in this area such as issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and issuing a proposed rule in july 2012 for a unique medical device identification system 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these lawsreferred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

  the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance we are now engaged in discussions with the government that may lead to changes in certain of our marketing practices and potentially payments which we do not expect to be material in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the “health care reform law” discussed in more detail in health care reform below by the second quarter of 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners 

 

  

  

including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which is likely to include us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect our business 

health care reform 

the health care reform law also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to increase access to health coverage some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses in particular a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity implementation had been delayed pending the issuance of applicable rules by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act the final rule provides that data collection activities begin on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 on or about june 1 2014 cms will publish information from these reports including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities in a national publicly available data bank 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope and we are in the process of analyzing its application to our businesses for example the final rule is unclear as to whether the physician payment sunshine act requires that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to the products they distribute such as we generally do are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements the cms commentary on the final rule indicates that they are however this interpretation appears to be inconsistent with the language of the physician payment sunshine act itself in addition because certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices we will in any event likely be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule is likely to pose additional costs on us 

 

  

 

on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court overturned certain lower federal court decisions to uphold as constitutional a key provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which requires individuals without health insurance to pay a penalty however the decision also invalidated a provision in the health care reform law requiring states to expand their medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal medicaid funding the court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement but that it may not take away preexisting medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion a number of states have indicated a reluctance to accept the medicaid expansion so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the health care reform law is uncertain 

regulated software electronic health records 

the united states food and drug administration or fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule is required by september 23 2013 and will increase the requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition federal initiatives including in particular the hitech act are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the hitech initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage one” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 which are more demanding and new incrementally more rigorous criteria are expected to be issued for stage “three” compliance however final standards have not yet been issued and so these criteria are not yet certain certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 but cms recently issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until october 1 2014 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

 

  

 

international transactions 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the health care distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

see “item 1a risk factors” for a discussion of additional burdens risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial condition or the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among health care products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased health care practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers and obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and seeking to develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties including among other things sovereign debt levels the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic currency or budgetary crises or issues consumer confidence unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population interest rates availability of capital fuel and energy costs tax rates health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall additionally recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

 

  

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

the health care industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including trends toward managed care consolidation of health care distribution companies consolidation of health care manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased health care practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of significant health care reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

 

the implementation of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely additionally further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

 

  

 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold for example i where we purchase medical devices from thirdparty manufacturers the manufacturers may increase their prices to cover their payment of the excise tax and our costs to purchase such medical devices may therefore increase and ii where we manufacture medical devices or are the importer of record our cost of goods sold have increased because we are subject to paying the excise tax 

the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity implementation had been delayed pending the issuance of applicable rules by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act the final rule provides that data collection activities begin on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 on or about june 1 2014 cms will publish information from these reports including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities in a national publicly available data bank 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope and we are in the process of analyzing its application to our businesses for example the final rule is unclear as to whether the physician payment sunshine act requires that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to the products they distribute such as we generally do are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements the cms commentary on the final rule indicates that they are however this interpretation appears to be inconsistent with the language of the physician payment sunshine act in addition because certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices we will in any event likely be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule is likely to pose additional costs on us 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the united states food and drug administration and united states drug enforcement administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to federal and state and similar foreign laws and regulations relating to health care fraud some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs health care fraud measures may implicate for example our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billingrelated functionality 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance we are now engaged in discussions with the government that may lead to changes in certain of our marketing practices and potentially payments which we do not expect to be material in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law by the second quarter of 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which is likely to include us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

 

  

 

the applicable requirements have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years also significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws and under the federal false claims act can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and federal antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

failure to comply with health care fraud laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial regulatory authorities increasing compliance risks 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect our business 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur penalties or other liabilities 

state federal and foreign laws such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released these measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers these also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply in addition under the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule is required by september 23 2013 and will increase the requirements applicable to some of our businesses failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

 

our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our global operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management and financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

 

  

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices bone regeneration and other health care products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

cybersecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to among other things 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems andor the loss of business information resulting in adverse business impact risks may include among other things 

 

 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if our is systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time 

 

we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technologybased a cyberattack that bypasses the security systems of our products or services causing a security breach andor perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could cause significant reputational harm actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers andor governmental agencies although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges 

failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive customer data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could also expose us to claims fines and penalties and costs for remediation additionally legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services 

 

we have various insurance policies including cyber liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

  

 

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan and 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control

industry overview 

in recent years the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the health care industry including consolidation of health care distribution companies health care reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the health care products distribution industry as it relates to officebased health care practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 30 billion in 2012 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to officebased health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals health systems group practices or physician hospital organizations in many cases purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level however orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial operating and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure we also have invested in expanding our salesmarketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the officebased practitioner setting 

as the health care industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased health care awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

according to the us census bureau’s international data base in 2012 there were more than five million americans aged 85 years or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to more than triple to approximately 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 85 during the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 20112021” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately 27 trillion in 2011 or 179 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states health care spending is projected to reach approximately 48 trillion in 2021 approximately 196 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance 

health care reform 

for example the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to increased health coverage the health care reform law requirements include for example a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which requires individuals without health insurance to pay a penalty however the decision also invalidated a provision in the health care reform law requiring states to expand their medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal medicaid funding the court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement but that it may not take away preexisting medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion a number of states have indicated a reluctance to accept the medicaid expansion so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the health care reform law is uncertain 

a health care reform law provision generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and for such manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity implementation had been delayed pending the issuance of applicable rules by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” on february 1 2013 cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act the final rule provides that data collection activities begin on august 1 2013 and first disclosure reports are due by march 31 2014 for the period august 1 2013 through december 31 2013 on or about june 1 2014 cms will publish information from these reports including amounts transferred and physician dentist and teaching hospital identities in a national publicly available data bank 

the final rule implementing the physician payment sunshine act is complex ambiguous and broad in scope and we are in the process of analyzing its application to our businesses for example the final rule is unclear as to whether the physician payment sunshine act requires that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to the products they distribute such as we generally do are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements the cms commentary on the final rule indicates that they are however this interpretation appears to be inconsistent with the language of the physician payment sunshine act itself in addition because certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices we will in any event likely be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians dentists and teaching hospitals it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers distributors physicians dentists and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act preempts similar state reporting laws although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws while we expect to have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements our compliance with the new final rule is likely to pose additional costs on us 

 

  

health care fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations some of these laws referred to as “false claims laws” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal state and other health care payers and programs other laws referred to as “antikickback laws” prohibit soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by federal state and other health care payers and programs 

the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims laws under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback law provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that a federal antikickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability 

the government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other as a result we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance in addition under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the “health care reform law” discussed in more detail in health care reform above by the second quarter of 2014 the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations which is likely to include us this information may lead to greater scrutiny which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs and could have a material adverse impact on our business also these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs in addition many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities increasing the risk of noncompliance 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws or changes in our services or marketing practices in response could adversely affect our business 

 

  

 

operating and security standards 

at the federal level the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdc act requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs which includes an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug currently the united states food and drug administration in exercise of its enforcement discretion requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs the united states food and drug administration or fda has continued to develop its policies regarding the integrity of the supply chain such as by issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and by issuing a proposed rule in 2012 for a unique medical device identification system 

many states have implemented or are considering similar drug pedigree laws and regulations there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system a number of states including florida have already implemented pedigree requirements including drug tracking requirements which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system california has enacted a statute that beginning in 2015 will require manufacturers to identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard machinereadable unique numerical identifier and will require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic trackandtrace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain the law will take effect on a staggered basis commencing on january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers other states have passed or are reviewing similar requirements bills have been proposed in congress that would impose similar requirements at the federal level 

the combat methamphetamine enhancement act of 2010 which became effective in april 2011 requires retail sellers of products containing certain chemicals such as pseudoephedrine to selfcertify to the drug enforcement administration “dea” that they understand and agree to comply with the laws and regulations regarding such sales the law also prohibits distributors from selling these products to retailers who are not registered with the dea or who have not selfcertified compliance with the laws and regulations various states also impose restrictions on the sale of certain products containing pseudoephedrine and other chemicals the secure and responsible drug disposal act of 2010 signed by president obama in october 2010 is intended to allow patients to deliver unused controlled substances to designated entities to more easily and safely dispose of controlled substances while reducing the chance of diversion the law authorizes the dea to promulgate regulations to allow but not require designated entities to receive unused controlled substances 

regulated software electronic health records 

the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

 

  

 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended and implementing regulations “hipaa” hipaa requires among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was enacted in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly affected by federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers on january 17 2013 the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements compliance with the rule is required by september 23 2013 and will increase the requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

i n addition federal initiatives including in particular the hitech act are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes the hitech initiative includes providing among others physicians and dentists with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services initial “stage one” standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011 cms has also issued a final rule with “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 which are more demanding and new incrementally more rigorous criteria are expected to be issued for stage “three” compliance however final standards have not yet been issued and so these criteria are not yet certain certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions commencing july 1 2012 cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm they were originally to be implemented on october 1 2013 but cms recently issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until october 1 2014 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care 

 

ecommerce 

electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets

this sales reporting is consistent with our global business groups as realigned in 2012 these groups were formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective as well as global product and service offerings and best practices 

we will continue to report financial results for our health care distribution and technology and valueadded services reportable segments the health care distribution segment comprises three global operating segments dental medical and animal health and the technology and valueadded services segment remains unchanged 

the 4097 million or 48 increase in net sales for the year ended december 29 2012 includes an increase of 67 local currency growth 51 increase in internally generated revenue 15 decrease due to the impact from extra week and 31 growth from acquisitions as well as a decrease of 19 related to foreign currency exchange

gross profit 

gross profit and gross margins for 2012 and 2011 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

gross profit increased 895 million or 37 for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

 

within our health care distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies 

health care distribution gross profit increased 701 million or 31 for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to the prior year period health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 268 for the year ended december 29 2012 from 272 for the comparable prior year period the decrease in our health care distribution gross profit margin is primarily due to growth in sales within our animal health businesses which typically include a greater percentage of lowermargin pharmaceutical products than our other operating units 

technology and valueadded services gross profit increased 194 million or 118 for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to the prior year period technology and valueadded services gross profit margin decreased to 648 for the year ended december 29 2012 from 655 for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix and from higher support costs associated with our growing number of software and eservices customers revenues generated from lower than average gross margins grew at a greater rate than traditional electronic services eg claims processing or software sales which typically generate higher than average gross margins

income taxes 

for the year ended december 29 2012 our effective tax rate was 311 compared to 317 for the prior year period the net reduction in our 2012 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense for 2013 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 310

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of securities and fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4081 million for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to 5546 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1465 million was primarily attributable to inventory buyins during the fourth quarter of 2012 in advance of potential price increases related to the medical device excise tax 

net cash used in investing activities was 2696 million for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to 1932 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 764 million was primarily due to increases in payments for equity investments and business acquisitions 

net cash used in financing activities was 1706 million for the year ended december 29 2012 compared to 3572 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1866 million was primarily due to increased net proceeds from issuance of debt and decreased acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries partially offset by increased repurchases of common stock 

we expect to invest approximately 60 million to 65 million during 2013 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our existing structure 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

  

  

  

availableforsale securities 

as of december 29 2012 we have approximately 33 million 28 million net of temporary impairments invested in auctionrate securities “ars” these investments are backed by student loans backed by the federal government and investments in closedend municipal bond funds ars are publicly issued securities that represent longterm investments typically 1030 years in which interest rates had reset periodically typically every 7 28 or 35 days through a “dutch auction” process our ars portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated investment grade by major independent rating agencies since the middle of february 2008 these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers the failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ars in the near term we are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ars we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates we believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ars investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities as of december 29 2012 we have classified ars holdings as longterm availableforsale and they are included in the investments and other line within our consolidated balance sheets 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 

 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations decreased to 398 days as of december 29 2012 from 406 days as of december 31 2011 during the years ended december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 we wrote off approximately 83 million and 62 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from operations decreased to 62 for the year ended december 29 2012 from 66 for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to inventory buyins in advance of potential price increases related to the medical device excise tax our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 37 as well as operating and capital lease obligations capital expenditure obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 29 2012 

 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase certain pharmaceutical products from a manufacturer through 2013 which require us to pay a price based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions we also have obligations to purchase certain pharmaceutical products from another manufacturer actual amounts may differ 

 

during 2013 we intend to refinance the debt of approximately 220 million related to the butler schein animal health transaction the refinancing is expected to reduce interest expense and to be accretive to earnings per share by 002 to 003 on an annualized basis we expect the refinancing to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2013 as part of that refinancing we expect to incur a onetime noncash charge of approximately 004 to 005 per diluted share 

 

redemption of convertible debt 

on september 3 2010 we paid approximately 240 million in cash and issued 732422 shares of our common stock in connection with the redemption of our 240 million of convertible notes which were issued in 2004 

  

credit facilities 

on september 12 2012 we entered into a new 500 million revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a 200 million expansion feature which expires on september 12 2017 this credit facility replaced our then existing 400 million revolving credit facility with a 100 million expansion feature which would have expired on september 5 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility as of december 29 2012 the interest rate which was 082 during the year ended december 29 2012 is based on the usd libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter the credit agreement provides among other things that we are required to maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios and contains customary representations warranties and affirmative covenants the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants subject to negotiated exceptions on liens indebtedness significant corporate changes including mergers dispositions and certain restrictive agreements 

as of december 29 2012 we had various other shortterm bank credit lines available of which approximately 272 million was outstanding at december 29 2012 borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 222 as of december 29 2012 there were 93 million of letters of credit provided to third parties under the credit facility 

private placement facilities 

on august 10 2010 we entered into 400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies on april 30 2012 we increased our available credit facilities by 375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies these facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance from time to time during a three year issuance period through april 26 2015 the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years with an average life no longer than 12 years the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness andor to fund potential acquisitions the agreement provides among other things that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness liens affiliate transactions disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership these facilities contain a makewhole provision in the event that we pay off the facility prior to the due date 

the components of our private placement facility borrowings as of december 29 2012 are presented in the following table 

 

  

butler animal health supply 

effective december 31 2009 bahs a majorityowned subsidiary whose financial information is consolidated with ours had incurred approximately 3200 million of debt of which 375 million which is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements was provided by henry schein inc in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in bahs 

on may 27 2011 bahs refinanced the terms and amount of its debt in an aggregate principal amount of 3660 million of which 550 million which is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements was provided by henry schein inc the refinanced debt consists of the following three components 

 

during 2011 and 2012 bahs made prepayments on term loans a and b which resulted in a reduction to the future quarterly and final installment amounts due future prepayments by bahs if any will result in reductions to remaining quarterly and final installment amounts due 

the outstanding balance of 2204 million net of unamortized debt discount and excluding amounts owed to henry schein inc is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012 

the debt agreement provides among other things that bahs maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness capital expenditures liens affiliate transactions disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership in addition the debt agreement contains provisions which under certain circumstances require bahs to make prepayments based on excess cash flows of bahs as defined in the debt agreement 

 

during 2013 we intend to refinance the debt of approximately 220 million related to the butler schein animal health transaction the refinancing is expected to reduce interest expense and to be accretive to earnings per share by 002 to 003 on an annualized basis we expect the refinancing to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2013 as part of that refinancing we expect to incur a onetime noncash charge of approximately 004 to 005 per diluted share 

 

stock repurchases 

from june 21 2004 through december 29 2012 we repurchased 7999 million or 13756063 shares under our common stock repurchase programs on april 18 2012 and november 12 2012 our board of directors authorized an additional 2000 million and 3000 million respectively for additional repurchases of our common stock 3001 million of which is available as of december 29 2012 for future common stock share repurchases 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met for acquisitions completed prior to 2009 we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt for 2009 and future acquisitions as required by asc topic 805 “business combinations” we have and will accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

on december 30 2011 we acquired all of oak hill capital partners’ “ohcp” remaining direct and indirect interests in bahs including its interest in wa butler company for 155 million in cash as a result of this transaction our ownership in bahs increased to approximately 717 at december 31 2011 the amount paid to ohcp for their remaining interests in bahs was in excess of the previously agreed upon annual limits see note 9 “business acquisitions and other transaction” within our notes to our consolidated financial statements but such limits were waived by all parties involved at december 29 2012 our ownership in bahs is approximately 737 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 407 million as of december 29 2012 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from multiple element arrangements and the related deferral of such revenue which is insignificant to our financial statements is recognized as follows when we sell software products together with related services ie training and technical support we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method based upon vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements or defer it until such time as vendorspecific evidence of fair value is obtained multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service effective december 26 2010 we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy first vsoe then thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if vsoe is not available and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business technical skill required customer location and other market conditions each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered 

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

  

 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments health care distribution global dental medical and animal health and technology and valueadded services 

during the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” “asu 201108” which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment included 

 

 

 

 

prior to the adoption of asu 201108 measuring fair value of a reporting unit was generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets this comparison is made based on a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment for certain indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through december 29 2012 that impacted our analysis 

 

  

 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

beginning with the first quarter of 2012 we changed our reporting units from dental medical animal health international and technology to global dental global medical global animal health and global technology and valueadded services 

these groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective as well as global product and service offerings and best practices 

in connection with this change in business groups goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units based upon this change we felt it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment in addition to a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter for the year ended december 29 2012 in order to establish a new baseline calculation 

 

for the years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units with the exception of stock options for certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

 

  

 

we issue restricted stock that vests solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time primarily fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time primarily threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors though there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures and share repurchases over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 29 2012 the net fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through june 26 2013 was 04 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 06 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents availableforsale securities shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners we serve nearly 775000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 79 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 15000 people of which over 6500 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland saudi arabia and turkey 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 28 billion in 2011 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are mckesson corp pss world medical inc and cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including carestream health inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc and athenahealth inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy arseus nv billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland turkey and the united kingdom 

  

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our healthcare distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

  

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2011 and 2021 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 14 between 2011 and 2031 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 27 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 9 between 2011 and 2021 and approximately 18 between 2011 and 2031 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across continental europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our animal health presence in europe as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

operating security and licensure standards 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 “pdma” which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its implementing regulations establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations from the united states drug enforcement administration permitting us to handle controlled substances we are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel for example florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug from distributors and potentially back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 

 

  

  

at the federal level the united states food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to pdma that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of certain of the federal drug pedigree requirements including the requirement to identify transactions back to the manufacturer nonetheless prescription drug pedigrees are required under federal regulations and the pdma and the pedigree must track back to the last manufacturer or authorized distributor of record or adr that handled the drug 

the united states food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on september 27 2007 requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration has continued to develop its policies in this area such as issuing a final guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and announcing its work on developing draft regulations for unique medical device identifiers 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

healthcare fraud 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs known as “antikickback” laws violations of these laws could result in civil and criminal penalties the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years particularly through “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes and can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim these laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation and can have a material adverse impact on us if a violation is found the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that an antikickback law violation can be a basis for false claims act liability 

healthcare reform 

the health care reform law also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and medicare expenditures and the cost of healthcare generally to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to provide access to health coverage for an additional 32 million people some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses in addition to the foregoing the health care reform law imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity data collection obligations were to commence in january 2012 and reporting requirements are to be implemented in 2013 on december 14 2011 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments thus apparently delaying the january 1 2012 start of information collection these proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized they will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as an entity subject to these reporting and disclosure requirements in addition through business arrangements we have with drug and device manufacturers we may be required to collect and report detailed information in order for these manufacturers to comply with the new requirements 

  

  

a provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which requires individuals without health insurance to pay a penalty was recently declared unconstitutional by certain federal courts while certain other federal courts have affirmed its constitutionality appeals are pending and the united states supreme court will review this issue during its 2012 term 

regulated software electronic health records 

the united states food and drug administration has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in healthcare settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers additional rules under the hitech act are expected to be issued in early 2012 further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition the hitech act established a program of medicare and medicaid incentive payments available to certain health care providers including among others physicians and dentists if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services while initial standards have been established new versions are expected to be issued over the next several years and the content of those standards is not certain certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions as of january 1 2012 subject to 90 days of cms enforcement discretion electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions were required to be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms is requiring this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm and are to be implemented on october 1 2013 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

international transactions 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records as well as other types of requirements similar to those imposed in the united states 

  

  

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

see “item 1a risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

proprietary rights 

we hold trademarks relating to the “henry schein” name and logo as well as certain other trademarks pursuant to agreements executed in connection with our reorganization in 1994 both henry schein inc and schein pharmaceutical inc which was acquired by watson pharmaceuticals inc in 2000 a company previously engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multisource pharmaceutical products are entitled to use the “schein” name in connection with their respective businesses but schein pharmaceutical inc must always use “schein” in combination with the word “pharmaceutical” and is not entitled to use the name “henry schein” or to use “schein” alone or with any other word other than “pharmaceutical” we intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial condition or the trading price of our common stock although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or provider networks and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medical products industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms additionally the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers and obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts and seeking to develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos we cannot assure such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

uncertain global macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these uncertainties including among other things sovereign debt levels the inability of national or international political institutions to effectively resolve economic or budgetary crises or issues consumer confidence unemployment levels and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population interest rates availability of capital fuel and energy costs tax rates healthcare costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

approximately 28 of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were derived from europe there have been continuing concerns and uncertainties about the state of the european economies and europe’s political institutions continued difficult andor declining economic conditions in europe may adversely affect our operations in europe by adversely affecting our european customers and vendors in the ways described above additionally the inability of europe’s political institutions to deal effectively with actual or perceived currency or budget crises could increase economic uncertainty in europe and globally and may have an adverse effect on our customer’s cash flow or operating performance further debt andor budget crises in the european countries may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall healthcare spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall in either event our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the implementation of the health care reform law may adversely impact us 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law significantly expands health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely additionally further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

  

the health care reform law also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity data collection obligations were to commence in january 2012 and reporting requirements are to be implemented in 2013 on december 14 2011 the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments thus apparently delaying the january 1 2012 start of information collection these proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized they will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as an entity subject to these reporting requirements in addition through business arrangements we have with drug and device manufacturers we may be required to collect and report detailed information to these manufacturers in order for these manufacturers to comply with the new requirements in addition several states require pharmaceutical andor device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states or prohibit certain marketing related activities other states such as california nevada massachusetts and connecticut require pharmaceutical andor device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states in others it is possible that our activities or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations 

the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid including imposing a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales the health care reform law also mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under medicare part d and in 2014 with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges which could affect pricing and competition 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the united states food and drug administration and united states drug enforcement administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government healthcare programs and damage our reputation any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud these measures which focus on our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes and can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim these healthcare fraud laws and regulations among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions we could be required to make significant changes to our products or incur penalties or other liabilities 

state federal and foreign laws such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released these measures may govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and may require the users of such information to implement specified security measures and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations other health information standards such as regulations under hipaa establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers these also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply in addition under the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers additional rules under the hitech act are expected to be issued in early 2012 further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

  

  traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

  

  the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

  

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan and 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter and certain other awards made under these incentive plans such as restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by the company or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control

executivelevel overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners we serve nearly 775000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 79 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 15000 people of which over 6500 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland saudi arabia and turkey 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

  

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions throughout the united states our animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics throughout the united states our international group serves dental medical and animal health practitioners in 22 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 28 billion in 2011 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

the us census bureau’s “statistical abstract of the united states 2011” reports that in 2010 more than five million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2050 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 19 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 2010 – 2020” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached approximately 26 trillion in 2010 or 176 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach approximately 46 trillion in 2020 approximately 198 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to extensive local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance 

 

healthcare reform 

 

for example the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act each enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of healthcare generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to health coverage for an additional 32 million people the health care reform law requirements include for example i a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011 both of which may affect sales and ii mandated pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under medicare part d and in 2014 with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges which could affect pricing and competition a provision in the health care reform law often referred to as the “individual mandate” which requires individuals without health insurance to pay a penalty was recently declared unconstitutional by certain federal courts while certain other federal courts have affirmed its constitutionality appeals are pending and the united states supreme court will review this issue during its 2012 term 

in addition to the foregoing the health care reform law imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians dentists and teaching hospitals and imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and group purchasing organizations with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity data collection obligations were to commence in january 2012 and reporting requirements are to be implemented in 2013 on december 14 2011 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments thus apparently delaying the january 1 2012 start of information collection these proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized they will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as an entity subject to these reporting and disclosure requirements in addition through business arrangements we have with drug and device manufacturers we may be required to collect and report detailed information to these manufactures in order for these manufacturers to comply with the new requirements in addition several states require pharmaceutical andor device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states or prohibit certain marketing related activities other states such as california nevada massachusetts and connecticut require pharmaceutical andor device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states in others it is possible that our activities including on behalf of manufacturers or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs known as “antikickback” laws violations of these laws could result in civil and criminal penalties the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years particularly through “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes and can be entitled to receive up to 30 of total recoveries also violations of the false claims act can result in treble damages and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to 11000 per claim these laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation and can have a material adverse impact on us if a violation is found the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits and among other things made clear that an antikickback law violation can be a basis for false claims act liability we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years 

operating and security standards 

 

regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act “pdma” effective december 2006 require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs that is drug pedigree information these requirements include tracking sales and distribution of prescription drug products from distributors and potentially manufacturers in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of certain parts of the federal drug pedigree requirements including the requirement to identify transactions back to the manufacturer on july 14 2011 the fda published a proposed rulemaking that would remove the requirement that a pedigree track back to the manufacturer and that certain information be identified on the pedigree as a result of the fda’s intent to resolve these issues the case was voluntarily dismissed in august 2011 fda policies in this area are still evolving 

many states have implemented or are considering similar drug pedigree laws and regulations there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system a number of states including florida have already implemented pedigree requirements including drug tracking requirements which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system california has enacted a statute that beginning in 2015 will require manufacturers to identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard machinereadable unique numerical identifier and will require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic trackandtrace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain other states have passed or are reviewing the same type of requirements bills have been proposed in congress that would impose similar requirements at the federal level 

 

the combat methamphetamine enhancement act of 2010 which became effective in april 2011 requires retail sellers of products containing certain chemicals such as pseudoephedrine to self certify to the drug enforcement administration “dea” that they are in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding such sales the law also prohibits distributors from selling these products to retailers who are not registered with the dea or who have not selfcertified compliance with the laws and regulations various states also impose restrictions on the sale of certain products containing pseudoephedrine and other chemicals the secure and responsible drug disposal act of 2010 signed by president obama in october 2010 is intended to allow patients to deliver unused controlled substances to designated entities to more easily and safely dispose of controlled substances while reducing the chance of diversion the law authorizes the dea to promulgate regulations to allow but not require designated entities to receive unused controlled substances 

 

  

 

regulated software electronic health records 

  

the united states food and drug administration has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in healthcare settings and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management and it is possible that the fda could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products 

 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended “hipaa” and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech act” which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers additional rules under the hitech act are expected to be issued in early 2012 further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition the hitech act established a program of medicare and medicaid incentive payments available to certain health care providers including among others physicians and dentists if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology “ehr” also eligible providers that fail to adopt certified ehr systems may be subject to medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015 qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services while initial standards have been established new versions are expected to be issued over the next several years and the content of those standards is not certain certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria 

also hipaa requires certain health care providers such as physicians to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions such as transactions involving claims submissions as of january 1 2012 subject to 90 days of cms enforcement discretion electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions were required to be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010 cms is requiring this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd10cm and are to be implemented on october 1 2013 certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards it is possible that the transition to these new standards particularly the transition to icd10cm may result in a degree of disruption and confusion thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting healthcare 

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities

plans of restructuring 

on november 5 2008 we announced certain actions to reduce operating costs these actions included the elimination of approximately 430 positions from our operations and the closing of several smaller facilities also during the first quarter of 2010 we completed an additional restructuring in order to further reduce operating expenses this restructuring included headcount reductions of 184 positions as well as the closing of a number of smaller locations 

during the years ended december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 123 million approximately 83 million after taxes and 30 million approximately 21 million after taxes respectively these costs primarily consisted of employee severance pay and benefits facility closing costs representing primarily lease termination and asset writeoff costs and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plans the costs associated with these restructurings are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income 

 

during 2012 we will be implementing a restructuring with the goal of improving profitability we expect to record restructuring charges of approximately 11 million to 13 million or approximately 008 to 010 per diluted share during the first half of 2012 as a result of this restructuring

gross profit increased 2472 million or 114 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

 

within our healthcare distribution segment gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin for example sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products conversely sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are better than average with respect to customer mix sales to our largegroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to officebased practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at higher frequencies 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 2200 million or 108 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin decreased to 272 for the year ended december 31 2011 from 278 for the comparable prior year period the decrease in our healthcare distribution gross profit margin is primarily due to growth in sales within our animal health businesses which typically include a greater percentage of lowermargin pharmaceutical products than our other operating units the increase in animal health sales results from internal growth in the united states and the acquisition of provet holdings limited see note 9 “business acquisitions discontinued operation and other transactions” within our notes to our consolidated financial statements at the beginning of our 2011 fiscal year 

technology gross profit increased 272 million or 199 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the prior year period technology gross profit margin decreased to 655 for the year ended december 31 2011 from 685 for the comparable prior year period primarily due to changes in the product sales mix specifically revenues generated from hardware sales and installations which generally are completed at a lower than average gross margin grew at a greater rate than electronic services claims processing statements generation etc or software sales which typically generate higher than average gross margins

other expense net decreased 63 million to 128 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from the comparable prior year period interest income increased 15 million primarily due to higher investment income partially offset by a decrease in late fee income interest expense decreased 33 million primarily due to reduced interest expense from the redemption of our 3 convertible contingent notes originally due in 2034 the “convertible notes” on september 3 2010 partially offset by increased interest expense related to borrowings under our private placement shelf facilities as well as interest expense related to our credit lines other net increased by 15 million due primarily to a gain associated with the acquisition of the remaining interest in an equity investment and proceeds received from a litigation settlement 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 317 compared to 319 for the prior year period the net reduction in our 2011 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes for 2012 we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 310

other expense net increased 77 million to 191 million for the year ended december 25 2010 from the comparable prior year period interest expense increased 103 million primarily due to debt associated with the acquisition of a majority interest in butler animal health supply llc partially offset by reduced interest expense from the redemption of all of our convertible notes on september 3 2010 and from repayment of our 1300 million senior notes on june 30 2009 interest income increased 41 million as a result of increased late fee income partially offset by lower interest income on our invested funds other net decreased by 16 million due primarily to net proceeds received from litigation settlements in the third quarter of 2009 partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 25 2010 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 319 compared to 282 for the prior year period the difference resulted primarily from the reduction of a valuation allowance in 2009 as explained below without the effect of the reduction of the valuation allowance described below our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december 26 2009 would have been 328 the net reduction in our 2010 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning settlements of tax audits a reduction of valuation allowances and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes 

during the third quarter of 2009 we substantially completed a plan of reorganization outside the united states that allowed us to utilize tax loss carryforwards to offset taxable income beginning in 2010 in certain foreign tax jurisdictions as a result we determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of deferred tax assets previously fully reserved will be realized therefore the 2009 provision for income taxes includes a 209 million reduction of the valuation allowance which is based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards 

loss from discontinued operations 

during the year ended december 26 2009 we recognized aggregate gains of 26 million net of tax related to a discontinued operation see note 9 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net income 

net income increased 190 million or 57 for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to the prior year period the increase in net income is primarily due to increased net sales excluding sales of seasonal influenza vaccines from both periods net income increased by approximately 35 

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions purchases of additional noncontrolling interests repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of securities and fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash flow provided by operating activities was 5546 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 3955 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1591 million was primarily attributable to favorable working capital changes as well as net income improvements after taking into account depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense and deferred taxes 

net cash used in investing activities was 1961 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 3880 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1919 million was primarily due to decreases in payments for equity investments and business acquisitions 

net cash used by financing activities was 3544 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 3302 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 242 million was primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock and an increase in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries partially offset by decreased net payments of debt 

we expect to invest approximately 50 million to 60 million during 2012 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our existing structure 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

  

availableforsale securities 

as of december 31 2011 we have approximately 125 million 113 million net of temporary impairments invested in auctionrate securities “ars” consisting of investments backed by student loans backed by the federal government and investments in closedend municipal bond funds ars are publicly issued securities that represent longterm investments typically 1030 years in which interest rates had reset periodically typically every 7 28 or 35 days through a “dutch auction” process our ars portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated investment grade by major independent rating agencies since the middle of february 2008 these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers the failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ars in the near term we are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ars we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates we believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ars investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities as of december 31 2011 we have classified ars holdings as longterm availableforsale and they are included in the investments and other line within our consolidated balance sheets 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns

on may 27 2011 bahs refinanced the terms and amount of its debt the refinanced debt consists of the following three components 

 

 

 

the outstanding balance of 2517 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011

the revised debt agreement continues to provide among other things that bahs maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness capital expenditures liens employee and shareholder loans disposal of businesses and certain changes in ownership in addition the revised debt agreement continues to contain provisions which under certain circumstances require bahs to make prepayments based on excess cash flows of bahs as defined in the debt agreement the revised debt agreement also contains provisions that require bahs to hedge risks related to potential rising interest rates as a result bahs entered into a series of interest rate caps for which we have elected hedge accounting treatment with a notional amount of 1600 million protecting against libor interest rates rising above 30 through march 30 2012 

acquisitions 

on december 31 2010 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of provet holdings limited asx pvt australasias largest wholesale distributor of veterinary products with sales in its 2010 fiscal year of approximately 278 million for approximately 91 million in a cashforstock exchange 

stock repurchases

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31 2011 december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met for acquisitions completed prior to 2009 we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt for 2009 and future acquisitions as required by asc topic 805 “business combinations” we have and will accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition any adjustments to these accrual amounts will be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

on december 30 2011 we acquired all of oak hill capital partners’ “ohcp” remaining direct and indirect interests in bahs including its interest in wa butler company for 155 million in cash as a result of this transaction our ownership in bahs increased to approximately 717 the amount paid to ohcp for their remaining interests in bahs was in excess of the previously agreed upon annual limits see note 9 “business acquisitions discontinued operation and other transaction” within our notes to our consolidated financial statements but such limits were waived by all parties involved 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” w e cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 245 million as of december 31 2011 

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from the sale of products consisting of multiple elements ie hardware software installation training and technical support is allocated to the various elements based upon vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or deferred until such time as vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value is obtained 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical animal health and international and technology 

during the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” “asu 201108” which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values the factors that we considered in developing our qualitative assessment included 

 

 

 

 

prior to the adoption of asu 201108 measuring fair value of a reporting unit was generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for certain indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through december 31 2011 that impacted our analysis 

some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income 

for the years ended december 31 2011 december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments 

  

 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units since march 2009 equitybased awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units with the exception of stock options for certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors though there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures and share repurchases over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

recently issued accounting standards 

accounting pronouncements adopted by us and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by us are included in “note 1 – significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by using an interest rate cap agreement and foreign currency forward contracts and through maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all interest rate cap and foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate or currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

interest rate hedges 

on may 27 2011 bahs refinanced the terms and amount of its debt into three separate components interest on the refinanced debt ranges from libor plus a margin of 3 to libor plus a margin of 325 one component of the refinanced debt contains a provision for minimum interest to be charged at a libor floor of 125 the revised debt agreement contains a provision that requires bahs to hedge risks related to potential rising interest rates as a result bahs has entered into series of interest rate caps with a notional amount of 1600 million protecting against libor interest rates rising above 3 through march 30 2012 

as of december 31 2011 the fair value of our interest rate cap agreements recorded in current and other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet was 0 which represented the amount that would be received upon unwinding the interest rate cap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate cap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income since the hedge is deemed fully effective 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 18 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 31 2011 the net fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through december 27 2012 recorded in other current liabilities was 08 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 17 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents availableforsale securities shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners we serve more than 700000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 78 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 13500 people of which over 6000 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland saudi arabia turkey and the united arab emirates 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

  

industry 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 28 billion in 2010 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

 

  

 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are mckesson corp pss world medical inc and cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including practiceworks inc and the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc and athenahealth inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitors are idexx laboratories inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy arseus nv billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland turkey and the united kingdom 

 

  

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2010 and 2020 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 15 between 2010 and 2030 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 29 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 10 between 2010 and 2020 and approximately 20 between 2010 and 2030 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across continental europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our animal health presence in europe as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

governmental regulations 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases serves as the legal basis for the united states food and drug administration’s regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 or pdma which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the united states drug enforcement administration and are subject to other regulatory requirements relating to the sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration the united states department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor hctp products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs known as “antikickback” laws violations of these laws could result in civil and criminal penalties the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject 

  

to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years particularly through “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes and an antikickback violation could be a basis for a false claims action these laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation and can have a material adverse impact on us if a violation is found the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in march 2010 known as the health care reform bill or ppaca significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the antikickback provisions which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits 

ppaca also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and medicare expenditures and the cost of healthcare generally to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to provide access to health coverage for an additional 32 million people some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses in addition to the foregoing ppaca imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians and dentists and teaching hospitals beginning in january 2012 a provision in ppaca requiring those without insurance to pay a penalty was recently declared unconstitutional by a virginia federal district court which permitted other provisions of the legislation that do not relate to health insurance as well as those provisions that could improve insurance coverage to remain in effect ppaca in its entirety was declared unconstitutional by a florida federal district court on january 31 2011 two other federal district courts in michigan and virginia have affirmed the constitutionality of ppaca appeals are pending and the matter is expected to be determined by the supreme court of the united states 

certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel for example florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the united states food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to pdma that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the court has continued to extend the injunction 

the united states food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on september 27 2007 requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration has indicated that it is currently drafting a proposed rule as required by the statute the united states food and drug administration has also indicated that it is developing a proposal to require unique device identifiers for medical devices 

  

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches as a result of the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act which was passed in 2009 some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of hipaa covered entities such as health care providers additional rules under the hitech act are expected to be issued in early 2011 further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what further reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

recently enacted legislation may adversely impact us 

the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform bill imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in january 2012 implementing regulations have not yet been issued but it is possible that such regulations when issued will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as a “manufacturer” subject to these reporting requirements in addition several states require pharmaceutical andor device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states or prohibit certain marketing related activities other states such as california nevada and massachusetts require pharmaceutical andor device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states in others it is possible that our activities or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions 

the patient protection and affordable care act also imposes i a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 which we may need to assist in implementing and which may affect sales and ii mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates discounts and price concessions which could affect pricing and competition 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products also known as hctp products among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health services act among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the united states food and drug administration and drug enforcement administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government healthcare programs and damage our reputation any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud these measures which focus on our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes damages can be catastrophic if a violation is found these healthcare fraud laws and regulations among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or hospital purchasing power and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medicalproducts industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers and obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts we cannot assure such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

  

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

  

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices bone regeneration and other healthcare products additionally we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

 

  

risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time 

 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

macroeconomic uncertainties that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states and other parts of the world could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

  

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things

executive level overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners we serve more than 700000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 78 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 13500 people of which over 6000 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland saudi arabia turkey and the united arab emirates 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

  

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings and other institutions throughout the united states our animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics throughout the united states our international group serves dental medical and animal health practitioners in 23 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 28 billion in 2010 in the combined north american european and australiannew zealand markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

  

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 2009 – 2019” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached approximately 25 trillion in 2009 or 173 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach approximately 46 trillion in 2019 approximately 196 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

  

government 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma was the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provided participants with voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefits beginning in 2006 the mma also included provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in march 2010 generally known as the health care reform bill or ppaca increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of healthcare generally to reduce fraud and abuse and to provide access to health coverage for an additional 32 million people ppaca also imposes i a 23 excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a “fee” on branded prescription drugs and biologics beginning in 2011 which may affect sales ii mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates discounts and price concessions which could affect pricing and competition and iii reduces the amount of outofpocket liability for patients participating in the medicare outpatient drug benefit program created by the mma a provision in ppaca requiring those without insurance to pay a penalty was recently declared unconstitutional by a virginia federal district court which permitted other provisions of the legislation that do not relate to health insurance as well as those provisions that could improve insurance coverage to remain in effect ppaca in its entirety was declared unconstitutional by a florida federal district court on january 31 2011 two other federal district courts in michigan and virginia have affirmed the constitutionality of ppaca appeals are pending and the matter is expected to be determined by the supreme court of the united states 

in addition to the foregoing ppaca imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners including physicians and dentists and teaching hospitals beginning in january 2012 implementing regulations have not yet been issued but it is possible that such regulations when issued will treat us or one or more of our subsidiaries as a “manufacturer” subject to these reporting requirements in addition several states require pharmaceutical andor device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states or prohibit certain marketing related activities other states such as california nevada massachusetts and connecticut require pharmaceutical andor device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states in others it is possible that our activities including on behalf of manufacturers or the activities of one or more of our subsidiaries will subject us to the state’s reporting requirements and prohibitions 

regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act effective december 2006 require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs that is drug pedigree information in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on december 31 2009 the us district court granted a motion to extend the time for either party to reopen the matter which had been administratively closed in light of potential legislative action by congress and the court in effect extended the injunction through june 30 2011 other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system an increasing number of states including florida have already adopted laws and regulations including drug pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system california has enacted a statute that beginning in 2015 will require manufacturers to 

  

identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard machinereadable numerical identifier and will require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic trackandtrace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain other states have passed or are reviewing the same type of requirements bills have been introduced in congress that would impose similar requirements at the federal level 

the combat methamphetamine enhancement act of 2009 signed by president obama in october 2010 prohibits distributors from selling listed chemical products used to manufacture methamphetamine and amphetamine illegally to individuals not currently registered with the drug enforcement administration dea or not on the united states attorney general’s published list of selfcertified entities the secure and responsible drug disposal act of 2010 also signed by president obama in october 2010 is intended to allow individuals to more easily and safely dispose of controlled substances while reducing the chance of diversion by facilitating the return of unused portions of controlled substances to designated entities including long term care facilities and law enforcement agencies the law does not authorize the dea to mandate that entities establish a drug disposal program 

there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting healthcare 

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities

on november 5 2008 we announced certain actions to reduce operating costs these actions included the elimination of approximately 430 positions from our operations and the closing of several smaller facilities also during the first quarter of 2010 we completed an additional restructuring in order to further reduce operating expenses this restructuring included headcount reductions of 184 positions as well as the closing of a number of smaller locations

gross profit increased 2541 million or 133 for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services as well as certain financial services for a number of reasons the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 2413 million or 135 for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin decreased to 278 for the year ended december 25 2010 from 282 for the comparable prior year period due to changes in product sales mix

other expense net for the years ended 2010 and 2009 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net increased 77 million to 191 million for the year ended december 25 2010 from the comparable prior year period interest expense increased 103 million primarily due to debt associated with the acquisition of a majority interest in butler animal health supply llc partially offset by reduced interest expense from the redemption of all of our convertible notes on september 3 2010 and from repayment of our 1300 million senior notes on june 30 2009 interest income increased 41 million as a result of increased late fee income partially offset by lower interest income on our invested funds other net decreased by 16 million due primarily to net proceeds received from litigation settlements in the third quarter of 2009 partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 25 2010 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 319 compared to 282 for the prior year period the difference resulted primarily from the reduction of a valuation allowance in 2009 as explained below without the effect of the reduction of the valuation allowance described below our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december 26 2009 would have been 328 the net reduction in our 2010 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning initiatives settlements of tax audits a reduction of valuation allowances and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes 

during the third quarter of 2009 we substantially completed a plan of reorganization outside the united states that allowed us to utilize tax loss carryforwards to offset taxable income beginning in 2010 in certain foreign tax jurisdictions as a result we determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of deferred tax assets previously fully reserved will be realized therefore the 2009 provision for income taxes includes a 209 million reduction of the valuation allowance which is based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards

for the year ended december 26 2009 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 282 compared to 332 for the prior year period the difference is primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets as well as additional tax planning initiatives settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries absent the effects of the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets in 2009 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26 2009 would have been 328 the remaining difference in our effective tax rate between 2009 and 2008 is due to foreign and state income taxes 

loss from discontinued operations 

during the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively we recognized aggregate gains and losses of 26 million and 79 million net of tax respectively related to discontinued operations see note 7 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net income 

net income increased 718 million or 275 for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to the prior year period the increase in net income is primarily due to the factors noted above 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions repayments of debt principal the funding of working capital needs purchases of securities and fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3889 million for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to 3969 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 80 million was primarily attributable to unfavorable working capital changes offset by net income improvements 

net cash used in investing activities was 4284 million for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to 974 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 3310 million was primarily due to increased payments for business acquisitions 

net cash used in financing activities was 2833 million for the year ended december 25 2010 compared to 1977 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 856 million was primarily due to increased acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in certain subsidiaries net repayments of longterm debt and increased repurchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises 

we expect to invest approximately 55 million to 60 million during 2011 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our existing structure 

  

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

availableforsale securities 

as of december 25 2010 we have approximately 151 million 134 million net of temporary impairments invested in auctionrate securities “ars” ars are publicly issued securities that represent longterm investments typically 1030 years in which interest rates had reset periodically typically every 7 28 or 35 days through a “dutch auction” process approximately 131 million 114 million net of temporary impairments of our ars are backed by student loans that are backed by the federal government and the remaining 20 million are invested in closedend municipal bond funds our ars portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated aaa by major independent rating agencies since the middle of february 2008 these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers the failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ars in the near term we are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ars we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates we believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ars investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities as of december 25 2010 we have classified ars holdings as longterm availableforsale and they are included in the investments and other line within our consolidated balance sheets 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations remained constant at 404 days as of december 25 2010 when compared to the prior year during the years ended december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 we wrote off approximately 67 million and 61 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from continuing operations increased to 65 for the year ended december 25 2010 from 62 for the year ended december 26 2009 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 49 as well as operating and capital lease obligations capital expenditure obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 25 2010 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase certain pharmaceutical products from a manufacturer through 2013 which require us to pay a price based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions we also have obligations to purchase certain pharmaceutical products from another manufacturer actual amounts may differ 

redemption of convertible debt 

on september 3 2010 we paid approximately 240 million in cash and issued 732422 shares of our common stock in connection with the redemption of our 2400 million of convertible notes which were issued in 2004 

the convertible notes were senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and were due to mature on august 15 2034 the convertible notes were convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of 4634 per share under the following circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

debt 

on september 5 2008 we entered into a 4000 million revolving credit facility with a 1000 million expansion feature the 4000 million credit line expires in september 2013 in addition to the amounts outstanding under our shelf facilities as discussed below we have outstanding borrowings of approximately 300 million under our 4000 million credit facility as of december 25 2010 there were 98 million of letters of credit provided to third parties 

on august 10 2010 we entered into a 4000 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies these shelf facilities are available through august 2013 on an uncommitted basis the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years with an average life no longer than 12 years the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures to refinance existing indebtedness andor to fund potential acquisitions as of december 25 2010 we have an outstanding balance under the facilities of 1000 million at a fixed rate of 379 which is due on september 2 2020 

acquisitions and acquisition commitment 

on october 14 2010 we announced an agreement to acquire 100 of the outstanding shares of provet holdings limited asx pvt australias largest distributor of veterinary products with sales in its 2010 fiscal year of approximately 278 million for approximately 91 million in a cashforstock exchange this transaction closed after year end 

  

effective december 31 2009 butler animal health supply llc or bahs a majorityowned subsidiary whose financial information is consolidated with ours incurred approximately 3200 million of debt of which 375 million was provided by henry schein inc in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in bahs the remaining outstanding balance of 2791 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 25 2010 

the debt incurred as part of the acquisition of bahs is repayable in 23 quarterly installments of 08 million through september 30 2015 and a final installment of 3016 million on december 31 2015 interest on the bahs debt is charged at libor plus a margin of 35 with a libor floor of 2 for a current effective rate of 55 as of december 25 2010 the debt agreement contains provisions which under certain circumstances require bahs to make prepayments of the loan commitment based on excess cash flows of bahs as defined in the debt agreement the debt agreement also contains provisions that require bahs to hedge risks related to potential rising interest rates as a result bahs entered into a series of interest rate caps with a notional amount of 1600 million protecting against libor interest rates rising above 30 through march 30 2012 

stock repurchases 

from june 21 2004 through december 25 2010 we repurchased 3000 million or 6639821 shares under our common stock repurchase programs on november 16 2010 our board of directors authorized an additional 1000 million for additional repurchases of our common stock all of which is available as of december 25 2010 for future common stock share repurchases 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities such redemption prices are equal to fair value based on thirdparty valuations asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 25 2010 december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met for acquisitions completed prior to 2009 we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt for 2009 and future acquisitions as required by asc topic 805 “business combinations” we have and will accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition any adjustments to these accrual amounts will be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as more fully disclosed in note 12 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we adopted asc topic 740 “income taxes” effective december 31 2006 we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 269 million as of december 25 2010 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from the sale of products consisting of multiple elements ie hardware software installation training and technical support is allocated to the various elements based upon vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or deferred until such time as vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value is obtained 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually such impairment analyses for goodwill require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical animal health and international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the end of our third quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for certain indefinitelived intangible assets a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows is utilized there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through december 25 2010 that impacted our analysis some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

for the year ended december 25 2010 the results of our goodwill impairment testing did not result in any impairments 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

  

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 

definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units in march 2009 and march 2010 equitybased awards were granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units with the exception of stock options for certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors though there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures and share repurchases over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by using an interest rate cap agreement and foreign currency forward contracts and through maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all interest rate cap and foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate or currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

interest rate hedges 

in connection with the debt incurred as part of the acquisition of butler animal health supply llc “bahs” bahs incurred 3200 million of debt interest on the debt is charged at libor plus a margin of 35 with a libor floor of 2 the debt agreement contains a provision that required bahs to hedge risks related to potential rising interest rates as a result bahs has entered into series of interest rate caps with a notional amount of 1600 million protecting against libor interest rates rising above 3 through march 12 2012 

as of december 25 2010 the fair value of our interest rate cap agreements recorded in other current and noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet was 14 thousand which represented the amount that would be received upon unwinding the interest rate cap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate cap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income since the hedge is deemed fully effective 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 12 months or less foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 25 2010 the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through may 26 2011 recorded in other current liabilities was 16 million as determined by quoted market prices a hypothetical 5 change in the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 23 million 

shortterm investments 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents availableforsale securities shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 275 billion in 2009 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the effects of reduced insurance coverage due to unemployment in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are the general medical division of mckesson corp pss world medical inc and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including practiceworks inc and patterson dental division in the animal health practice management market our primary competitor is idexx laboratories inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc and athenahealth inc 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal spain switzerland and the united kingdom 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results

business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2009 and 2019 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 16 between 2009 and 2029 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 30 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 10 between 2009 and 2019 and approximately 21 between 2009 and 2029 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 56 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 49 in 1996 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across continental europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our animal health presence in europe as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters while recent history has resulted in flat to declining sales we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

governmental regulations 

certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and in this regard we are subject to various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health service act we are also subject to comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state section 361 of the public health service act “regulations to control communicable diseases” serves as the legal basis for such regulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the united states drug enforcement administration and are subject to other regulatory requirements relating to the sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration the department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices andor human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products or own pharmacy operations or install maintain or repair equipment in addition section 301 of the national organ transplant act and a number of comparable state laws impose civil andor criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue for example human bone products for valuable consideration while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring processing storing and distributing that tissue the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years particularly through “relators” who file 

complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes these laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation and can have a material adverse impact on us if a violation is found certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with the governments and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and safe working conditions in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and repackagers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the united states food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act or pdma that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on december 31 2009 the us district court granted a motion to extend the time for either party to reopen the matter which had been administratively closed in light of potential legislative action by congress and the court in effect extended the injunction through september 30 2010 

the united states food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on september 27 2007 requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration is currently conducting pilot programs and seeking feedback from medical device manufacturers and distributors who are willing to comment prior to unique device identifier udi rulemaking expected mid2010 

certain of our businesses involve access to personal health medical financial and other information of individuals and are accordingly subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information and require among other things the implementation of various recordkeeping operational notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy breaches 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial markets and other macroeconomic uncertainties that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states and other parts of the world could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and human cells tissue and cellular and tissuebased products “hctp” among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and section 361 of the public health services act “regulations to control communicable diseases” among other things such laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy and security of health or other personal information installation maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the united states food and drug administration and drug enforcement administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities 

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government healthcare programs and damage our reputation any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud these measures which focus on our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers have been subject to varying interpretations as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators” who file complaints in the name of the united states and if applicable particular states under federal and state false claims act statutes damages can be catastrophic if a violation is found these healthcare fraud laws and regulations among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

expansion of group purchasing organizations “gpo” or hospital purchasing power and the multitiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

the medicalproducts industry is subject to a multitiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain the multitiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power such as gpos demand more favorable pricing terms this may threaten our ability to compete effectively which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers and obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts we cannot assure such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters while recent history has resulted in flat to declining sales we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain 

acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices bone regeneration and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the 

transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations

our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time 

 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business

executive level overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners we serve more than 600000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 77 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 12500 people of which over 5500 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany hong kong sar ireland israel italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental and medical equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves 21 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services on a nonrecourse basis eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 275 billion in 2009 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking 

to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 2008 – 2018” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 24 trillion in 2008 or 166 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach 44 trillion in 2018 approximately 203 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

government influences 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefits this act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system an increasing number of states including florida have already adopted laws and regulations including drug pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act or pdma effective december 2006 require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs that is drug pedigree information in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on december 31 2009 the us district court granted a motion to extend the time for either party to reopen the matter which had been administratively closed in light of potential legislative action by congress and the court in effect extended the injunction through september 30 2010 other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation 

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

plans of restructuring 

on november 5 2008 we announced certain actions to reduce operating costs which included the elimination of 430 positions from our operations and the closing of several smaller facilities during the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 we recorded onetime restructuring costs of approximately 30 million approximately 21 million after taxes and 232 million approximately 160 million after taxes respectively the costs associated with the restructuring are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income the majority of these costs have been paid as of december 26 2009 annual pretax cost savings from this initiative are expected to be between 240 million and 270 million 

in addition during the first quarter of 2010 we expect to complete an additional restructuring in order to further reduce operating expenses this restructuring includes headcount reductions as well as the closing of facilities the restructure is primarily concentrated in our european operations and is part of our overall plan to increase international operating margins these restructuring costs are expected to be in the 10 million to 12 million range 7 million to 9 million after taxes and are expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2010 however timing of certain actions may cause some restructuring costs to be reported later

1 adjusted to reflect the effects of discontinued operations 

 

gross profit increased 425 million or 23 for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products as well as certain financial services for a number of reasons the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 389 million or 22 for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin remained constant at 282 for the year ended december 26 2009 compared with the comparable prior year period

other expense net decreased 125 million to 114 million for the year ended december 26 2009 from the comparable prior year period the decrease was primarily the result of decreased interest expense of 112 million due to repayment of our 1300 million senior notes on june 30 2009 as well as lower interest rates on our floating debt partially offset by a decrease in interest income of 64 million resulting from lower interest rates on our invested funds in addition other net increased by 76 million due primarily to net proceeds received from litigation settlements in the third quarter of 2009 and nonrecurring charges incurred during the third quarter of 2008 relating to the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 26 2009 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 282 compared to 332 for the prior year period the difference is primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets related to net operating losses as well as additional tax planning settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries absent the effects of the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2009 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26 2009 would have been 328 the remaining difference in our effective tax rate between 2009 and 2008 is due to foreign and state income taxes for 2010 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 325 to 335 

loss from discontinued operations

other expense net increased 154 million to 238 million for the year ended december 27 2008 from the comparable prior year period as a component of other expense net interest income was substantially unchanged from the prior year interest expense increased 50 million primarily due to forward points related to foreign currency hedging transactions and the impact of the adoption of provisions contained within asc topic 47020 “debt with conversion and other options” partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt the change in other net resulted from a reserve for losses of 37 million for foreign exchange contracts for hedging intercompany loans with lehman brothers special financing inc whose parent lehman brothers holdings inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 an additional 08 million was attributable to a reserve for losses in our investment in the reserve primary fund a money market fund that decreased its net asset value from 100 to 097 due to investments in lehman brothers debt the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates also contributed to the increase in other net the prior period’s other net included a gain from the divestiture of certain noncore businesses related to the acquisition of a dental supply company in 2007 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 27 2008 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 332 compared to 340 for the prior year period the difference was impacted by additional tax planning initiatives settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes 

loss from discontinued operations 

during the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively we recognized aggregate losses of 79 million and 207 million net of tax related to discontinued operations see note 7 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net income 

net income increased 322 million or 140 for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to the prior year period the increase in net income is primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations in 2007 net income included a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of 07 million net of taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs repayments of debt principal funding of acquisitions purchases of securities and fixed assets and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3969 million for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to 3848 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 121 million results from net income improvements offset by decreases related to components of our working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was 974 million for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to 1680 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 706 million was primarily due to a reduction in payments for business acquisitions proceeds received from a business divestiture and the absence of purchases of availableforsale securities in the current year partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from foreign exchange forward contract settlements 

net cash used in financing activities was 1977 million for the year ended december 26 2009 compared to 880 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1097 million was primarily due to increased payments for longterm debt including repayment of 1300 million of our senior notes on june 30 2009 as well as an increase in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests of subsidiaries partially offset by the absence of stock repurchases in the current year 

we expect to invest approximately 50 million to 55 million during 2010 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our core structure 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity 

as of december 26 2009 we have approximately 211 million 189 million net of temporary impairments invested in auctionrate securities “ars” ars are publicly issued securities that represent longterm investments typically 1030 years in which interest rates had reset periodically typically every 7 28 or 35 days through a “dutch auction” process approximately 187 million 165 million net of temporary impairments of our ars are backed by student loans that are backed by the federal government and the remaining 24 million are invested in closedend municipal bond funds our ars portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated aaa by major independent rating agencies since the middle of february 2008 these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers the failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ars in the near term we are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ars we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates we believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ars investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities as of december 26 2009 we have classified ars holdings as longterm availableforsale and they are included in the investments and other line within our consolidated balance sheets 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations decreased to 404 days as of december 26 2009 from 414 days as of december 27 2008 during the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 we wrote off approximately 61 million and 65 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from continuing operations decreased to 62 for the year ended december 26 2009 from 65 for the year ended december 27 2008 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 32 as well as operating and capital lease obligations capital expenditure obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 26 2009 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from a manufacturer through 2012 which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions we also have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from another manufacturer actual amounts may differ 

in 2004 we completed an issuance of 2400 million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and are due to mature on august 15 2034 interest on the notes is payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of 4634 per share under the following circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our 4000 million revolving credit facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy our debt obligations including the cash portion of our convertible debt we also will pay contingent interest during any sixmonthinterest period beginning august 20 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels we may redeem some or all of the notes on or after august 20 2010 the note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on august 15 2010 2014 2019 2024 and 2029 or subject to specified exceptions upon a change of control event if we are required by the note holders to purchase all or a portion of the notes we will use our existing credit line to fund such purchase therefore we have classified our convertible debt as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet 

our 200 million of remaining senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 67 per annum and mature on september 27 2010 interest on our senior notes is payable semiannually 

on september 5 2008 we entered into a new 4000 million revolving credit facility with a 1000 million expansion feature the 4000 million credit line expires in september 2013 this credit line replaced our then existing 3000 million revolving credit line which would have expired in may 2010 as of december 26 2009 there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility and there were 102 million of letters of credit provided to third parties 

as further discussed in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” which is incorporated herein by reference effective december 31 2009 we incurred approximately 3200 million of debt in connection with the acquisition of a majority interest in butler animal health supply llc 

under our common stock repurchase programs approved by our board of directors we have 577 million available for future common stock share repurchases during the year ended december 26 2009 we did not repurchase any of our common stock 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on thirdparty valuations effective december 28 2008 we have adopted the provisions of asc topic 48010 asc topic 48010 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements as a result of the adoption of the provisions of asc topic 48010 we have recorded the estimated fair value of the redeemable securities 1786 million 2330 million and 1500 million at december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively and reduced additional paidin capital and noncontrolling interests within the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets the components of the change in the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 are presented in the following table 

 

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paidin capital future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level these adjustments will not impact the calculation of earnings per share 

additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met for acquisitions completed prior to 2009 we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt for 2009 and future acquisitions as required by asc topic 805 “business combinations” we will accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition any adjustments to these accrual amounts will be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

as more fully disclosed in note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we adopted asc topic 740 “income taxes” effective december 31 2006 we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest of 209 million as of december 26 2009 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is typically completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from the sale of products consisting of multiple elements ie hardware software installation training and technical support is allocated to the various elements based upon vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks are not amortized but are subject to at least an annual impairment analysis such impairment analyses for goodwill require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including animal health international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis our impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangibles consists of a review of historical current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually at the end of our third quarter and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through december 26 2009 that impacted our analysis some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award prior to march 2009 awards principally included a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units in march 2009 equitybased awards were granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units with the exception of stock options for certain preexisting contractual obligations 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance as measured against specified targets over a threeyear period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors though there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant adjustments to the performancebased restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions divestitures new business ventures and share repurchases over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts and through maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

interest rate swap agreements 

we have remaining fixed rate senior notes of 200 million at 67 during 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 02 million 

as of december 26 2009 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet was 05 million which represented the amount that would be received upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 200 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 12 months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure

 item 1 business 

 

general 

 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 575000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 76 years of distributing healthcare products 

 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 12500 people of which approximately 5000 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland israel saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 

 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental and medical equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

 

industry 

 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 275 billion in 2008 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acutecare settings or hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

 

 

 

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices 

 

competition 

 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are the general medical division of mckesson corp pss world medical inc and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are butler animal health supply llc mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including practiceworks inc and patterson in the animal health practice management market our primary competitor is idexx laboratories inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc and athenahealth inc 

 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv billericay dental supply co ltd national veterinary services and alcyon sa as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium china the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom 

 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

competitive strengths 

 

we have more than 76 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “henry schein” name our competitive strengths include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

products 

 

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our healthcare distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business strategy 

 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2008 and 2018 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 16 between 2008 and 2028 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 29 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 9 between 2008 and 2018 and approximately 18 between 2008 and 2028 

 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 57 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 49 in 1996 

 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings or hospitals to physicians’ offices a trend that provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across continental europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our animal health presence in europe as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

 

governmental regulations 

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and comparable foreign regulations 

 

  the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce 

 

 

 

 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the united states drug enforcement administration and are subject to other regulatory requirements relating to the sale marketing handling and distribution of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration the department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices or own pharmacy operations the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with the governments and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the united states food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on february 1 2007 the united states department of health and human services and the united states food and drug administration appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals for the second circuit this injunction was upheld by the court of appeals on july 10 2008 

 

 

 

 

the united states food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on september 27 2007 requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration must develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

disruptions in the financial markets and other macroeconomic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the united states and other parts of the world could adversely impact our customers and vendors which could adversely affect us recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales we generally sell products to customers with payment terms if customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us likewise for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control recent disruptions in the financial markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions reduced lending activity decreased liquidity and higher costs in the commercial paper market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit there can be no assurances that recent government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us 

 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully   

 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors price competition the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business 

 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 such laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy of health or other personal information and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 

 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters civil and criminal penalties mandatory recall of product seizure of product and injunction and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses noncompliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in government healthcare programs any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations 

 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any 

 

 

 

 

way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

 

  we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations services products and personnel of each company within our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of 

 

 

 

these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices bone regeneration and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in companies that manufacture certain dental products as a result we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

 

competition among companies supplying practice management software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

 

 

 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

 

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through thirdparty delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 

 

in 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixedrate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our 2300 million senior notes our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 69 and 67 for the remaining 1300 million and the remaining 400 million senior notes respectively the variable rate is comprised of libor plus spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and 2001 nonemployee director incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause by the company or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control 

 

tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend 

 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical medical devices and other healthcare products as a business practice we generally obtain product liability indemnification from our suppliers 

 

we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection in our opinion all pending matters are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

as of december 27 2008 we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss this accrued amount as well as related expenses was not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors including probable recoveries from third parties

executive level overview 

 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 575000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 76 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 12500 people of which approximately 5000 are based outside the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada china the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal slovakia spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland israel saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 

 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

 

 

 

 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental and medical equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves 21 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

 

industry overview 

 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

 

our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services 

 

industry consolidation 

 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 275 billion in 2008 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking 

 

 

 

 

to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

 

our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 

 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

 

aging population and other market influences 

 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices 

 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 2007 – 2017” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 21 trillion in 2006 or 160 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach 43 trillion in 2017 approximately 195 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

 

 

 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 

 

 

 

 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefits this act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement 

 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system an increasing number of states including florida have already adopted laws and regulations including drug pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act effective december 2006 require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs that is drug pedigree information other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation 

 

 

 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities

plan of restructuring 

 

on november 5 2008 we announced certain actions to reduce operating costs these actions included the elimination of approximately 300 positions from our operations or approximately 25 of our workforce at that time and the closing of several smaller facilities 

 

for the year ended december 27 2008 we incurred onetime restructuring costs of 232 million 160 million after taxes consisting of employee severance pay and benefits facility closing costs representing primarily lease termination and asset writeoff costs and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan the costs associated with the restructuring are included in a separate line item “restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income we expect that the majority of these costs will be paid in 2009 we expect to record remaining costs of 10 million to 30 million during the first quarter of 2009 

 

annual pretax cost savings from this initiative are expected to be approximately 240 million to 270 million

the 1192 million or 48 increase in dental net sales for the year ended december 27 2008 is due to local currency growth 40 internally generated and 08 from acquisitions the 48 local currency growth was due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 50 42 internal growth and 08 from acquisitions and dental equipment sales and service growth of 41 35 internal growth and 06 from acquisitions the growth in equipment sales was primarily due to gains in both traditional equipment and hightech products

gross profit and gross margins for 2008 and 2007 by segment and in total were as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

gross profit increased 1680 million or 98 for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products as well as certain financial services the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 1455 million or 90 for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased to 283 for the year ended december 27 2008 from 280 for the comparable prior year period

for the year ended december 27 2008 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 332 compared to 340 for the prior year period the difference was impacted by additional tax planning initiatives settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes for 2009 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 330 to 340

other expense net decreased 54 million to 37 million for the year ended december 29 2007 from the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to an increase in other income resulting from a gain on the divestiture of certain noncore businesses related to the acquisition of a dental supply company during 2007 and a reduction in interest expense resulting from principal repayments of debt made during 2007 

 

income taxes 

 

for the year ended december 29 2007 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 340 compared to 356 for the prior year period the difference resulted from a combination of additional tax planning initiatives settlements of tax audits revaluation of deferred income taxes a nonrecurring tax charge resulting from a european restructuring and higher levels of income generated in lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes 

 

as a result of tax legislation enacted in germany the united kingdom and italy for 2007 deferred income taxes were revalued resulting in a 56 million reduction in deferred income tax accounts and a corresponding reduction of income tax expense additionally in response to the legislation enacted in germany a restructuring was implemented in 2007 resulting in a nonrecurring income tax charge of 35 million 

 

loss from discontinued operations

net income 

 

net income increased 514 million or 314 for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to the prior year period the increase in net income is primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations in 2007 net income includes a net gain on the sale of discontinued operations of 07 million net of taxes in 2006 net income includes a loss on the sale of discontinued operations of 194 million net of taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs funding of acquisitions purchases of securities and fixed assets repayments of debt principal and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables historically sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year causing our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year we expect that there will be no improvement to the current economic environment during 2009 however we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future 

 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities and debt placements our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services and access to products and services from our suppliers given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates 

 

net cash flow provided by operating activities was 3846 million for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to 2702 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 1144 million was due to favorable changes in net working capital of 881 million and an increase in cash generated by higher net income as compared to 2007 the cash flow was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter due to various timing variables for vendor payments made after december 27 2008 that increased cash flow by approximately 400 million to 500 million 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 1679 million for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to 2420 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 741 million was primarily due to a reduction in payments for business acquisitions and purchases of fixed assets increased net proceeds from foreign exchange forward contract settlements and a decrease in purchases of availableforsale securities partially offset by decreases in proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities and cash received from business divestitures in the prior year 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 880 million for the year ended december 27 2008 compared to 311 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 569 million was primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock 

 

we expect to invest approximately 400 million to 500 million during 2009 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our core structure 

 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity at december 29 2007 our availableforsale securities consisted of an investment in stock of a single company which was sold in 2008 

 

as of december 27 2008 we have approximately 290 million invested in auctionrate securities “ars” ars are publicly issued securities that represent longterm investments typically 1030 years in which interest rates had reset periodically typically every 7 28 or 35 days through a “dutch auction” process approximately 218 million of our ars are backed by student loans that are backed by the federal government and the remaining 72 million are invested in closedend municipal bond funds our ars portfolio is comprised of investments that are rated aaa by major independent rating agencies since the middle of february 2008 these auctions have failed to settle due to an excess number of sellers compared to buyers the failure of these auctions has resulted in our inability to liquidate our ars in the near term we are currently not aware of any defaults or financial conditions that would negatively affect the issuers’ ability to continue to pay interest and principal on our ars we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually agreed upon rates we believe that the current lack of liquidity related to our ars investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth opportunities as of december 27 2008 we have classified ars holdings as longterm availableforsale and they are included in the investment and other line within our consolidated balance sheet 

 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements 

 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations increased to 413 days as of december 27 2008 from 405 days as of december 29 2007 during the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 we wrote off approximately 65 million and 98 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from continuing operations decreased to 64 as of december 27 2008 from 69 as of december 29 2007 our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 44 as well as operating and capital lease obligations capital expenditure obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 27 2008 

 

 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from glaxosmithkline biologicals through 2012 which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions actual amounts may differ 

 

 

 

 

in 2004 we completed an issuance of 2400 million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and are due to mature on august 15 2034 interest on the notes is payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of 4634 per share under the following circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our 4000 million revolving credit facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy our debt obligations including the cash portion of our convertible debt we also will pay contingent interest during any sixmonthinterest period beginning august 20 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels we may redeem some or all of the notes on or after august 20 2010 the note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on august 15 2010 2014 2019 2024 and 2029 or subject to specified exceptions upon a change of control event 

 

our 1700 million of senior notes include 1300 million of notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 69 per annum and mature on june 30 2009 and 400 million of notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 67 per annum and mature at a rate of 200 million per annum on september 25 2009 and september 27 2010 respectively interest on both notes is payable semiannually 

 

in 2003 we entered into swap agreements relating to our 2300 million senior notes to exchange their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the value of debt exchanged to a variable rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes as of december 27 2008 there is 1700 million of principal remaining with a weightedaverage interest rate of 684 this weightedaverage variable interest rate is comprised of libor plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes 

 

on september 5 2008 we entered into a new 4000 million revolving credit facility with a 1000 million expansion feature the 4000 million credit line expires in september 2013 this credit line replaced our then existing 3000 million revolving credit line which would have expired in may 2010 as of december 27 2008 there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility and there were 130 million of letters of credit provided to third parties 

 

from june 21 2004 through december 27 2008 we repurchased 2423 million or 5633952 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 577 million available for future common stock share repurchases under repurchase programs approved by our board of directors 

 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on thirdparty valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements which approximates fair value additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we 

 

 

 

 

believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt for 2009 and future acquisitions we will accrue liabilities for additional purchase price adjustments at the time of the acquisition any adjustments to these accrual amounts will be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 

 

as more fully disclosed in note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” effective december 31 2006 we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits of 129 million as of december 27 2008 

 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 

 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery 

 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

 

revenue derived from the sale of products consisting of multiple elements ie hardware software installation training and technical support is allocated to the various elements based upon vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value 

 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

 

accounts receivable and reserves 

 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 

 

 

 

inventories and reserves 

 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily by the firstin firstout method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment in performing our lower of cost or market valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to at least an annual impairment analysis such impairment analyses for goodwill require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including animal health international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

 

supplier rebates 

 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 

 

 

 

longlived assets 

 

longlived assets include indefinite and definitelived intangible assets definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123r “sharebased payment” we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” in our consolidated financial statements we elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by fas 123r 

 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units 

 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

 

we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements threeyear cliff vesting 

 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance measured against specified targets over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that performance targets will be achieved over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets 

 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

 

 

 

 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas 141” and statement no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “fas 160” fas no 141 revised 2007 requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired this standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies fas 141 revised 2007 applies prospectively to business combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 

 

fas 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements consolidated net income should include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent the presentation provisions of fas 160 are to be applied retrospectively and fas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that fas 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1572 “partial deferral of the effective date of statement 157” “fsp 1572” fsp 1572 delays the effective date of sfas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp 1572 on nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued fas 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “fas 161” fas 161 requires disclosures of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format fas 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about creditriskrelated contingent features in derivative agreements fas 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of fas 161 but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” the fsp will require us to allocate the liability and equity components of the convertible debt and reflect our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate for the interest component of the convertible debt the fsp will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon the retrospective implementation of this fsp we will record an unamortized debt discount of approximately 326 million which will be amortized over a period of six years from the date our convertible debt was issued this will result in recording additional annual interest expense of approximately 53 million pretax or approximately 34 million aftertax which approximates 004 per share 

 

in june 2008 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 075 “determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock” “eitf 075” eitf 075 provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equitylinked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock including evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise and the instruments settlement provisions eitf 075 clarifies the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and marketbased employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation eitf 075 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the implementation of eitf 075 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” this fsp applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with sfas 157 this fsp clarifies the application of sfas 157 in determining the fair values of assets or liabilities in a market that is not active this fsp is effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued the adoption of this fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts and through maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

 

interest rate swap agreements 

 

we have fixed rate senior notes of 1300 million at 69 and 400 million at 67 during 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 17 million 

 

as of december 27 2008 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet was 25 million which represented the amount that would be received upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 1700 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 

 

foreign currency agreements 

 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 12 months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with longterm intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

 

as of december 27 2008 we had net outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts that hedge against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies with notional amounts of 502 million which were related to intercompany debt and the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers the us dollar based contracts of 938 million hedge currency fluctuations against the euros 697 million british pounds 196 million australian dollars 43 million canadian dollars 11 million swiss francs 08 million and japanese yen 01 million which are offset by our international business whose notional amount of such contracts was 436 million a hypothetical 5 change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 70 million 

 

as of december 27 2008 the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through december 15 2009 recorded in other current liabilities was 66 million as determined by quoted market prices for the year ended december 27 2008 we had realized net losses of 24 million and unrealized gains of 06 million relating to such agreements 

 

 

 

 

shortterm investments 

 

we limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents availableforsale securities shortterm investments and derivative instruments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counterparties to such financial instruments as a risk management policy we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counterparties

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

the combination of acquisitions acquisition integrations and systems implementations completed throughout the year when considered in aggregate represent a material change in our internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the quarter ended december 27 2008 we closed a number of acquisitions in the united states and internationally with approximate aggregate annual revenues of 2830 million each utilizing separate information and financial accounting systems and these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements see note 7 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion in addition during the quarter we also closed a number of acquisitions that have been integrated into existing enterprise resource planning “erp” systems in the united states with approximate aggregate annual revenues of 190 million and that are covered by our existing system of internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the year ended december 27 2008 acquisition integrations completed in previous quarters included an erp integration for our uk businesses as well as an erp integration for our business in italy with approximate aggregate annual revenue of approximately 4720 million also a number of smaller acquisitions were closed during previous quarters in the united states and internationally with approximate aggregate annual revenues of 130 million finally we completed an inventory system enhancement in north america to automate accounting processing with aggregate approximate annual revenues of 370 million and an implementation of a new corporate treasury system with managed assets of approximately 2952 million 

 

all acquisitions acquisition integrations and systems implementations have involved necessary and appropriate changemanagement controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

 

other than the acquisitions acquisition integrations and system implementations discussed above there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 27 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion henry schein inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2008 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of henry schein inc as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 and the related consolidated statements of income changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 27 2008 and our report dated february 23 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 550000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 75 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 12000 people of which over 5000 are based outside of the united states and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland israel and the united arab emirates 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental and medical equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves approximately 85 of the estimated 136000 officebased dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market based upon an estimated 60 billion combined united states and canadian dental market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 40 in 2007 

our medical group serves approximately 45 of the estimated 250000 officebased physician practices as well as surgical centers and other alternatecare settings throughout the united states we also serve over 75 of the estimated 27000 animal health clinics in the united states based upon an estimated 90 billion combined market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 17 in 2007 

our international group serves approximately 240000 practices in 18 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practices based upon an estimated 105 billion european combined dental medical and animal health market in which we operate we estimate our share of this market was approximately 17 in 2007 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practicemanagement software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 255 billion in 2007 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acutecare settings or hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the eldercare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are the patterson dental division of patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are the general medical division of mckesson corp pss world medical inc and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are butler animal health supply llc mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including practiceworks inc and patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitor is idexx laboratories inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete with numerous companies such as nextgen healthcare information systems inc eclinicalworks allscripts llc athenahealth inc and misys plc healthcare systems division 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv and billericay dental supply co ltd as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in australia austria belgium the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal spain switzerland and the united kingdom 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results 

competitive strengths 

we have more than 75 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “henry schein” name our competitive strengths include 

direct sales and marketing expertise  our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives frequent direct marketing and telesales contact emphasizing our broad product lines including exclusive distribution agreements competitive prices and ease of order placement the key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are 

 

 

 

broad product and service offerings at competitive prices  we offer a broad range of products and services to our customers at competitive prices in the following categories 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment to superior customer service  we maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service we frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys focus groups and statistical reports our customer service policy primarily focuses on 

 

 

integrated management information systems  our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions including accounts receivable inventory accounts payable payroll purchasing sales and order fulfillment these systems allow us to manage our growth deliver superior customer service properly target customers manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics 

costeffective purchasing  we believe that costeffective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitivepricing provider of healthcare products we continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost in 2007 our top 10 healthcare distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 32 and 9 respectively of our aggregate purchases 

efficient distribution  we distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers we strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment these inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems once an order is entered it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment 

products 

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our healthcare distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

 

 business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2007 and 2017 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 17 between 2007 and 2027 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 30 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of approximately 9 between 2007 and 2017 and approximately 18 between 2007 and 2027 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 57 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 49 in 1996 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings or hospitals to physicians’ offices a trend that provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across continental europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model and our animal health presence throughout europe as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we also have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world 

for information on revenues and longlived assets by geographic area see note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” which is incorporated herein by reference 

seasonality and other factors affecting our business and quarterly results 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased 

healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

governmental regulations 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling reporting marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the united states drug enforcement administration and are subject to other regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such drugs in accordance with specified rules and regulations we are subject to inspection by the united states drug enforcement administration 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration united states food and drug administration the department of health and human services and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices or own pharmacy operations the united states drug enforcement administration the united states food and drug administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations our customers are also subject to significant federal state local and foreign governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state and similar foreign healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with the governments and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug back to the manufacturers effective january 1 2009 california will require the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification or rfid technologies there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the united states food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of some of the federal drug pedigree requirements in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on february 1 2007 the united states department of health and human services and the united states food and drug administration appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals for the second circuit we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding moreover the united states food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on september 27 2007 requires the united states food and drug administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the united states food and drug administration must develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products certain of our businesses also may be subject to requirements relating to the protection and privacy of health or other personal information we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare distribution industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us

 item 1a risk factors 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended and the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 such laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy of health or other personal information and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws or if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in government healthcare programs any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulation and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance with the laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering purchasing leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering purchasing or leasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and assimilating the operations services products and personnel of each company with our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of products by that entity one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practicemanagement software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practicemanagement software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may be adversely affected 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our orders through third party delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the continued advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 

in 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixedrate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our 1900 million senior notes our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 69 and 67 for the 1300 million and 600 million senior notes respectively the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and 2001 nonemployee director incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in control 

we also have a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if our board of directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate and in the stockholders’ best interest 

tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

 item 3 legal proceedings 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical medical devices and other healthcare products as a business practice we generally obtain product liability indemnification from our suppliers 

we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection in our opinion all pending matters are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 29 2007 we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss this accrued amount as well as related expenses was not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors including probable recoveries from third parties

executive level overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 550000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 75 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 12000 people and have operations in the united states australia austria belgium canada the czech republic france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands new zealand portugal spain switzerland and the united kingdom we also have affiliates in iceland israel and the united arab emirates 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments this segment consists of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment equipment repair services branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves 18 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand our valueadded practice solutions include practicemanagement software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services eservices and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 255 billion in 2007 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently more than 300 smaller distributors holding approximately 27 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 38 of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that more than 200 smaller distributors hold approximately 80 of the market 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger andor acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the eldercare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms published “national health expenditure projections 2006 — 2016” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 20 trillion in 2005 or 160 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach 41 trillion in 2016 approximately 200 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

government influences 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system an increasing number of states including florida have already adopted laws and regulations including drug pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act effective december 2006 require the identification and documentation of transactions involving the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs that is drug pedigree information other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation 

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities

 gross profit increased 2463 million or 167 for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry in which developers typically realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 2237 million or 160 for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin decreased slightly to 280 for the year ended december 29 2007 from 282 for the comparable prior year period

 other expense net decreased 52 million to 40 million for the year ended december 29 2007 from the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to an increase in other income resulting from a gain on the divestiture of certain noncore businesses of beckerparkin during 2007 and a reduction in interest expense resulting from principal repayments of debt being made during 2007 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 29 2007 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 340 compared to 356 for the prior year period the difference resulted from a combination of additional tax planning settlements of tax audits revaluation of deferred income taxes a nonrecurring tax charge resulting from a european restructuring and higher levels of income generated in lower taxing countries the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to foreign and state income taxes for 2008 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34 to 35 

as a result of tax legislation enacted in germany the united kingdom and italy for 2007 deferred income taxes were revalued resulting in a 56 million reduction in deferred income tax accounts and a corresponding reduction of income tax expense additionally in response to the legislation enacted in germany a restructuring was implemented in 2007 resulting in a nonrecurring income tax charge of 35 million

 gross profit increased 1635 million or 125 for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices for categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry in which developers typically realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 1551 million or 125 for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased slightly to 282 for the year ended december 30 2006 from 280 for the comparable prior year period

 other expense net decreased 72 million to 92 million for the year ended december 30 2006 from the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and average investment balances a gain of approximately 20 million associated with a change in accounting for net investment hedging arrangements see note 1 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion and increased interest expense due to higher interest rates partially offset by a reduction of interest expense of approximately 28 million representing the interest rate component of our marktomarket adjustment 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 30 2006 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 356 compared to 367 for the prior year period the difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions working capital needs purchases of fixed assets repayments of debt principal and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables since sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities debt placements and stock issuances our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for and provision by our suppliers of our products and services given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent with recent trends in the foreseeable future 

net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2702 million for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to 2353 million for the comparable prior year period this net change of 349 million was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations noncash charges for impairment from a writedown of longlived assets of discontinued operations and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries offset by a net decrease in working capital noncash gain on sale of discontinued operations net of tax in the prior year and an increase in the benefit from deferred income taxes 

net cash used in investing activities was 2420 million for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to 1804 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 616 million was primarily due to decreases in availableforsale securities sales and cash received from a business divestiture in the prior year as well as an increase for foreign exchange forward contract settlements partially offset by a decrease in purchases of availableforsale securities and fixed assets 

net cash used in financing activities was 311 million for the year ended december 29 2007 compared to 213 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 98 million was primarily due to increased repayments of longterm debt and other offset by a decrease in repurchases of our common stock during the year ended december 29 2007 

we expect to invest approximately 500 to 550 million during 2008 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems and to integrate certain operations into our core structure 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity at december 29 2007 our availableforsale securities consist of an investment in stock of a single company at december 30 2006 our availableforsale securities consisted of highly liquid taxefficient securities including primarily auctionrate securities and variablerate demand notes 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continuing sales growth 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations improved to 407 days as of december 29 2007 from 408 days as of december 30 2006 during the years ended december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 we wrote off approximately 98 million and 66 million respectively of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve our inventory turns from continuing operations increased to 68 as of december 29 2007 from 67 as of december 30 2006 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 55 as well as operating and capital lease obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 29 2007 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from glaxosmithkline biologicals or gsk and novartis ag through 2014 which with respect to gsk require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions actual amounts may differ 

our convertible debt which matures in 2034 is available to be redeemed beginning on or after august 20 2010 

as more fully disclosed in note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” effective december 31 2006 we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits of 125 million as of december 29 2007 

in 2004 we completed an issuance of 2400 million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and are due to mature on august 15 2034 interest on the notes is payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of 4634 per share under the following circumstances 

 

 

 

 

upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our 3000 million revolving credit facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation we also will pay contingent interest during any sixmonthinterest period beginning august 20 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels we may redeem some or all of the notes on or after august 20 2010 the note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on august 15 2010 2014 2019 2024 and 2029 or subject to specified exceptions upon a change of control event 

our 1300 million senior notes are due on june 30 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 69 per annum on september 28 2007 we made our second annual principal payment of 200 million on our 1000 million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 67 per annum remaining principal payments are due annually on september 25 2008 and 2009 and september 27 2010 interest on both notes is payable semiannually 

in 2003 we entered into agreements relating to our 2300 million senior notes to exchange their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the value of debt exchanged to a variable rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes as of december 29 2007 there is 1900 million of principal remaining with a weightedaverage interest rate of 838 for the year ended december 29 2007 the weightedaverage variable interest rate was 842 this weightedaverage variable interest rate is comprised of libor plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes 

on may 24 2005 we entered into a 3000 million revolving credit facility with a 1000 million expansion feature this facility expires in may 2010 as of december 29 2007 there were 111 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility 

during 2007 we repurchased 307 million or 639100 shares under our common stock repurchase programs with 1405 million available for future common stock share repurchases under repurchase programs approved by our board of directors 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on thirdparty valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements which approximates fair value additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventories and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily by the firstin firstout method in performing our lower of cost or market valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment analyses such impairment analyses for goodwill require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including animal health international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123r “sharebased payment” we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” in our consolidated financial statements we elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by fas 123r 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance measured against specified targets over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that performance targets will be achieved over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

recently issued accounting standards 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fas interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fas no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognitions and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the adoption of fin 48 effective december 31 2006 resulted in a decrease to stockholders’ equity of approximately 03 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas 157” fas 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fas 157 applies under other previously issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements fas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years with the exception of all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis which will be effective for years beginning after november 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of fas 157 on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” fas 158 requires an employer to recognize the over or underfunded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status net of tax through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur fas 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position the provisions of fas 158 became effective for our year ended december 30 2006 with the exception of the requirement to measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end which is effective for our fiscal year ending december 27 2008 during december 2006 we implemented the requirement to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit plans recognizing the funded status of our defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position 

in february 2007 fasb issued fas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “fas 159” including an amendment to fasb no 115 fas 159 provides entities with the irrevocable option to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election called the fair value option will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions fas 159 is effective as of the beginning of a company’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of fas 159 on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” and statement no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” fas no 141 revised 2007 requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired this standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies fas 141 revised 2007 applies prospectively to business combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that fas 141 revised 2007 will have on our accounting for past and future acquisitions and our consolidated financial statements 

statement no 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements consolidated net income should include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent the presentation provisions of fas 160 are to be applied retrospectively and fas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that fas 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other and changes to the credit markets we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts and through maintaining counterparty credit limits these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital 

interest rate swap agreements 

we have fixed rate senior notes of 1300 million at 69 and 600 million at 67 during 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 19 million 

as of december 29 2007 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was 12 million which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 1900 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 12 months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with longterm intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 29 2007 we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of 4277 million of which 3563 million related to intercompany debt and 714 million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers the contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the us dollar for euros 2522 million british pounds 1238 million australian dollars 347 million canadian dollars 85 million swiss francs 60 million and new zealand dollars 25 million in addition our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies the notional amount of such contracts was 878 million a hypothetical 5 change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 188 million 

as of december 29 2007 the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through december 18 2008 recorded in other current liabilities was 37 million as determined by quoted market prices for the year ended december 29 2007 we had realized net gains of 08 million and unrealized gains of 11 million relating to such agreements 

shortterm investments

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 500000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our 75 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 11000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland israel australia and new zealand we also have an affiliate in iceland 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments products distributed include consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves approximately 85 of the estimated 135000 officebased dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market based upon an estimated 55 billion combined united states and canadian dental market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 38 in 2006 

our medical group serves approximately 45 of the estimated 250000 officebased physician practices as well as surgical centers and other alternatecare settings throughout the united states we also serve over 75 of the estimated 26000 animal health clinics in the united states based upon an estimated 85 billion combined market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 17 in 2006 

our international group serves approximately 240000 practices in 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practices based upon an estimated 80 billion european combined dental medical and animal health market in which we operate we estimate our share of this market was approximately 15 in 2006 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practicemanagement software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 220 billion in 2006 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices and other alternatecare settings the eldercare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in north america we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and animal health products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our primary competitors are patterson companies inc and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are pss world medical inc the general medical division of mckesson corp and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the animal health market our primary competitors are butler animal health supply llc mwi veterinary supply inc animal health international inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and animal health distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous companies including practiceworks inc which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of the onex corporation and patterson companies inc in the animal health practice management market our primary competitor is idexx laboratories inc the medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete against numerous companies such as misys plc healthcare systems and quality system’s inc’s nextgen healthcare information systems divisions 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv and billericay dental supply co ltd as well as a large number of dental medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria ireland italy australia new zealand portugal spain and switzerland 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results 

competitive strengths 

we have 75 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “henry schein” name our competitive strengths include 

direct sales and marketing expertise  our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives frequent direct marketing and telesales contact emphasizing our broad product lines including exclusive distribution agreements competitive prices and ease of order placement the key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are 

 

broad product and service offerings at competitive prices  we offer a broad range of products and services to our customers at competitive prices in the following categories 

 

 

 

commitment to superior customer service  we maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service we frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys focus groups and statistical reports our customer service policy primarily focuses on 

 

integrated management information systems  our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions including accounts receivable inventory accounts payable payroll purchasing sales and order fulfillment these systems allow us to manage our growth deliver superior customer service properly target customers manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics 

costeffective purchasing  we believe that costeffective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a lowcost provider of healthcare products we continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost in 2006 our top 10 healthcare distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30 and 7 of our aggregate purchases 

efficient distribution  we distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers we strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment these inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems once an order is entered it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment 

products 

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our healthcare distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

 

 business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2006 and 2016 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 18 between 2006 and 2026 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 32 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of 9 between 2006 and 2016 and 18 between 2006 and 2026 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as this segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 55 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 47 in 1995 

we support our dental professionals through the many skus that we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that provides additional opportunities for us there also is the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and animal health practices we are in the process of implementing sap software across europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model throughout europe and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world 

seasonality and other factors affecting our business 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

governmental regulations 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the safe medical devices act of 1990 as amended and comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering or purchasing of items or services that are paid for by government health care programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state and local laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example certain states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by paperwork tracing drugs back to the manufacturers there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the federal food and drug administration issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling our product and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products certain of our businesses also may be subject to federal and state requirements relating to the protection and privacy of health or other personal information we also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records

 item 1a risk factors 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies consolidation of healthcare manufacturers collective purchasing arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and additional regulations could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the safe medical devices act of 1990 as amended such laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal and state laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy of health or other personal information and the importation and exportation of products our business also is subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current or future united states or foreign government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable federal and state statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a state or the federal government that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws or if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect to healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an 

adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and assimilating the operations services products and personnel of each company with our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures accounts receivable and management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical products medical devices and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of products by that entity one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at 

a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have an adverse effect on our business 

our technology segment depends upon continued software and eservices product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practicemanagement software andor eservices is intense and increasing our future sales of practicemanagement software and eservices will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software software enhancements or eservices or that such software software enhancements and eservices will be released on time or accepted by the market our software and applicable eservices products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software or eservices and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or eservices products 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers suppliers and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may suffer 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our us orders through united parcel service inc and other delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 

in 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixedrate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our 2100 million senior notes our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 69 and 67 for the 1300 million and 800 million senior notes respectively the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would have an adverse effect on our business 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and 2001 nonemployee director incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in control 

we also have a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if our board of directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate and in the stockholders’ best interest 

tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments

we believe that our properties are in good condition are well maintained and are suitable and adequate to carry on our business we have additional operating capacity at certain distribution center facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products as a business practice we generally obtain product indemnification from our suppliers 

we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection in our opinion all pending matters including those described below are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 30 2006 we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss this accrued amount as well as related expenses was not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts 

presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors including probable recoveries from third parties 

product liability claims 

as of december 30 2006 we were a defendant in approximately 44 product liability cases in many of these cases the manufacturers have agreed to defend and indemnify us the manufacturers have withheld defense indemnification in some of these cases pending product identification in our opinion these cases are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

executive level overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 500000 customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our 75 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than 11000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland israel australia and new zealand we also have an affiliate in iceland 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution 

reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments products distributed include consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased medical practitioners surgical centers other alternatecare settings animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practitioners 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practicemanagement software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 220 billion in 2006 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently more than 300 smaller distributors holding over 25 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold over 50 of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that more than 200 smaller distributors hold over 80 of the market 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger and acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the eldercare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published “national health care expenditures projections 2005 — 2015” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 19 trillion in 2004 or 160 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach 40 trillion in 2015 an estimated 200 of the nation’s gross domestic product 

government influences 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act the “medicare act” is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary 

prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement 

there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system certain states have already adopted laws and regulations including pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act effective december 2006 require the passage of pedigree information other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation

gross profit increased 1631 million or 124 for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry in which developers typically realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 1547 million or 124 for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased slightly to 278 for the year ended december 30 2006 from 275 for the comparable prior year period

other expense net for the years ended 2006 and 2005 was as follows in thousands 

 

other expense net decreased 72 million to 93 million for the year ended december 30 2006 from the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and average investment balances a gain of approximately 20 million associated with a change in accounting for net investment hedging arrangements see note 1 to accompanying consolidated financial statements and a reduction of interest expense of approximately 28 million representing the interest rate component of our marktomarket adjustment partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher interest rates 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 30 2006 our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 356 compared to 367 for the prior year period the difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables since sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities debt placements and stock issuances our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for and provision by our suppliers of our products and services given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future we do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources 

net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2353 million for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to 2548 million for the comparable prior year period this net change of 195 million was due primarily to timing changes in working capital accounts partially offset by increased net income net cash used in investing activities was 1804 million for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to 2067 million for the comparable prior year period net cash used in financing activities was 213 million for the year ended december 30 2006 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 285 million for the prior year period 

we expect to invest approximately 450 million to 500 million during 2007 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations into our core structure 

the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands 

 

 

 our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 our availableforsale securities consisted of highly liquid taxefficient securities including primarily auctionrate securities and variablerate demand notes 

our business requires a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities and our desired level of 

inventory we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continuing sales growth 

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations improved to 408 days as of december 30 2006 from 418 days as of december 31 2005 during the year ended december 30 2006 we wroteoff approximately 66 million of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve which had no effect on our 2006 earnings our inventory turns from continuing operations decreased to 68 as of december 30 2006 from 70 as of december 31 2005 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt including interest assuming an average longterm rate of interest of 55 as well as operating and capital lease obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 30 2006 

 

inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from glaxosmithkline biologicals formerly id biomedical corporation novartis ag and the sanofiaventis group through 2014 which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions 

in 2004 we completed an issuance of 2400 million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and are due to mature on august 15 2034 interest on the notes is payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year which commenced on february 15 2005 the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is the equivalent conversion price of 4634 per share under the following circumstances 

 

upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our 3000 million revolving credit 

facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation we also will pay contingent interest during any sixmonth interest period beginning august 20 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels we may redeem some or all of the notes on or after august 20 2010 the note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on august 15 2010 2014 2019 2024 and 2029 or subject to specified exceptions upon a change of control event 

our 1300 million senior notes are due on june 30 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 69 per annum on september 25 2006 we made our first annual principal payment of 200 million on our 1000 million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 67 per annum principal payments are due annually on september 25 2006 through 2010 interest on both notes is payable semiannually 

in 2003 we entered into agreements relating to our 2300 million senior notes to exchange their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the value of debt exchanged to a variable rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes as of december 30 2006 there is 2100 million of principal remaining with a weightedaverage interest rate of 81 for the year ended december 30 2006 the weightedaverage variable interest rate was 86 this weightedaverage variable interest rate is comprised of libor plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes 

on may 24 2005 we entered into a 3000 million revolving credit facility with a 1000 million expansion feature this facility which expires in may 2010 replaced our previous revolving credit facility of 2000 million which was scheduled to expire in may 2006 as of december 30 2006 there were 82 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility 

on june 21 2004 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program this program previously allowed us to repurchase up to 1000 million in shares of our common stock which represented approximately 35 of the shares outstanding on the announcement date on october 31 2005 our board of directors authorized an additional 1000 million of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program as of december 30 2006 we had repurchased 1288 million or 3373142 shares under this initiative with 712 million remaining for future common stock share repurchases 

some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on thirdparty valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements which approximates fair value additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs 

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to 

address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit 

worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventory and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily by the firstin firstout method in performing our lower of cost or market valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment analyses such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including animal health international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

supplier rebates 

supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123r “sharebased payment” we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” in our consolidated financial statements we elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by fas 123r and accordingly financial statement amounts for all prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair value method of expensing had been applied from the original effective date of fas 123 such results are consistent with our previously reported pro forma disclosures required under fas 123 

we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of atthemoney stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility riskfree interest rates and dividend yields 

we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time fouryear cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements threeyear cliff vesting 

with respect to timebased restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performancebased restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance measured against specified targets over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of performancebased restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that performance targets will be achieved over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets 

although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to stockbased compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

recently issued accounting standards 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fas interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fas no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on future changes classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of fin 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 “fair value measurements” fas 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fas 157 applies under other previously issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements fas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the impact of fas 157 on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 123r” fas 158 requires an employer to recognize the over or underfunded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status net of tax through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur fas 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position the provisions of fas 158 are effective for our year ended december 30 2006 with the exception of the requirement to measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end which is effective for our fiscal year ending december 27 2008 during december 2006 we implemented the requirement to recognize the funded status of our retirement benefit plans recognizing the funded status of our defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 

interest rate swap agreements 

we have fixed rate senior notes of 1300 million at 69 and 800 million at 67 during 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 21 million 

as of december 30 2006 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was 67 million which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 2100 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 

net investment hedging 

during the year ended december 30 2006 we implemented a change in our method of assessing the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in spot exchange rates previously we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates this change in method essentially converts certain us libor based borrowings to euro libor based borrowings allowing us to better align our interest costs and the currencydenomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests 

with regard to all net investment hedging arrangements that existed at the time of this change we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change as a result we recognized a pretax gain of approximately 20 million representing the foreign exchange component of our marktomarket adjustment for the period from the date of change through december 30 2006 

additionally as a result of this change we recognized a reduction in interest expense of approximately 28 million representing the interest rate component of our marktomarket adjustment given current market conditions we expect further reductions of interest expense into the foreseeable future 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie 12 months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with longterm intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of 

merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 30 2006 we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of 4787 million of which 4202 million related to intercompany debt and 585 million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers the contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the us dollar for euros 3344 million british pounds 348 million australian dollars 227 million swiss francs 11 million japanese yen 1685 thousand and canadian dollars 53 million in addition our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies the notional amount of such contracts was 802 million a hypothetical 5 change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 206 million 

as of december 30 2006 the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through january 2 2008 recorded in other current liabilities was 87 million as determined by quoted market prices for the year ended december 30 2006 we had realized net gains of 15 million and unrealized gains of 15 million relating to such agreements

 item 1 business 

general 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 500000 customers worldwide including dental practices and laboratories physician practices and veterinary clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 73 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 11000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland israel australia and new zealand we also have an affiliate in iceland 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including veterinary and international operating segments products distributed consist of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infection control products and vitamins 

our dental group serves approximately 80 of the estimated 135000 officebased dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market based upon an estimated 50 billion combined united states and canadian dental market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 38 in 2005 

our medical group serves approximately 45 of the estimated 250000 officebased physician practices as well as surgical centers and other alternatecare settings throughout the united states we also serve over 70 of the estimated 26000 veterinarian clinics in the united states based upon an estimated 80 billion combined market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 17 in 2005 

our international group serves approximately 230000 practices in 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practices based upon an estimated 80 billion western and central european combined dental medical and veterinary market in which we operate we estimate our share of this market was approximately 16 in 2005 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare providers primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and veterinary markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 21 billion in 2005 in the combined north american and western and central european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one distributor generally serving as the primary supplier 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of healthcare technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the healthcare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

competition 

the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 

in the united states we compete with other distributors as well as several manufacturers of dental medical and veterinary products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our principal national competitors are patterson companies inc formerly patterson dental company and benco dental supply company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our principal competitors in the sale of medical products are pss world medical inc the general medical division of mckesson corp and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the veterinary market our principal national competitors are butler animal health supply llc mwi veterinary supply inc and the webster veterinary division of patterson companies inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our dental practice management software we compete against numerous firms including firms such as practiceworks inc a subsidiary of the eastman kodak company and patterson companies inc in the veterinary practice 

management market our primary competitor is idexx laboratories inc the electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete against numerous firms 

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv and billericay dental supply co ltd as well as a large number of dental product distributors and manufacturers in the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria ireland italy australia new zealand portugal and spain 

significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results 

competitive strengths 

we have more than 73 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “henry schein” name our competitive strengths include 

direct sales and marketing expertise  our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact emphasizing our broad product lines competitive prices and ease of order placement the key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are 

 

broad product and service offerings at competitive prices  we offer a broad range of products and services to our customers at competitive prices in the following categories 

 

 

 

commitment to superior customer service  we maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service we frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys focus groups and statistical reports our customer service policy primarily focuses on 

 

integrated management information systems  our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions including accounts receivable inventory accounts payable payroll purchasing sales and order fulfillment these systems allow us to manage our growth deliver superior customer service properly target customers manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics 

costeffective purchasing  we believe that costeffective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a lowcost provider of healthcare products we continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost in 2005 our top 10 healthcare distribution vendors and our single largest vendor accounted for approximately 25 and 6 of our aggregate purchases 

efficient distribution  we distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers we strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment these inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems once an order is entered it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment 

products 

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our healthcare distribution and technology reportable segments 

 

 

 business strategy 

our objective is to continue to expand as a valueadded distributor of healthcare products and services to officebased healthcare practitioners to accomplish this we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets served 

demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2005 and 2015 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 19 between 2005 and 2025 this age group is expected to grow by approximately 33 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of 9 between 2005 and 2015 and 18 between 2005 and 2025 

in the dental industry there is predicted to be an attendant rise in oral healthcare expenditures as this segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 55 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 47 in 1995 

we support our dental professionals through the many stock keeping units we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency 

there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that provides additional opportunities for us there is also the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased physician practitioner 

we believe our international group is a leading european healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental medical and veterinary practices we are in the process of replicating our us infrastructure across europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model throughout europe and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we have the capability to provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world 

seasonality and other factors affecting our business 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

governmental regulations 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the safe medical devices act of 1990 as amended and comparable foreign regulations 

the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce 

the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be registered with the secretary of health and human services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct business and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance the safe medical devices act which also amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act imposes certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the event of incidents involving serious injury illness or death caused by a medical device distributed by us 

under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the attorney general in accordance with specified rules and regulations and are subject to inspection by the drug enforcement administration acting on behalf of the attorney general we are required to maintain licenses and permits for the distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of the states in which we operate our customers are also subject to significant governmental regulation 

certain of our businesses are required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration united states food and drug administration the department of health and human services and various state boards of 

pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing or sale these businesses include those that distribute manufacture andor repackage prescription pharmaceuticals andor medical devices or own pharmacy operations 

certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations such laws prohibit among other things persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering or purchasing of items or services which are paid for by government health care programs certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 

certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal state and local laws and regulations including with respect to the sale transportation handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by paperwork tracing drugs back to the manufacturers in addition united states and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products certain of our businesses may also be subject to federal and state requirements relating to the protection and privacy of health or other personal information 

while we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and bypass distributors like us industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 

the healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies collective purchasing arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners and changes in reimbursements to customers if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and additional regulations could negatively affect our business 

our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the safe medical devices act of 1990 as amended such laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable federal and state laws and regulations may also require us to meet various standards relating to among other things licensure or registration sales and marketing practices product supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product personnel privacy of health or other personal information and the importation and exportation of products our business is also subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 

the failure to comply with any of these regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current or future united states or foreign government regulations will not adversely affect our business the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable federal and state statutes and regulations as they now exist and as they may be modified could be material allegations by a state or the federal government that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws or if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of noncompliance we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines and the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our businesses we believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to be subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government healthcare programs while we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 

our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of our acquisition of the demedis group and other foreign companies our foreign operations are significantly larger and therefore our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations has become greater 

we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline 

because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products 

we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an 

adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks 

we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following 

 

 

 

we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of products by that entity one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate additionally in many cases we are covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product however we cannot provide assurance that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover future claims that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for us a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or indemnification or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could harm our business 

our technology segment depends upon continued product development technical support and successful marketing 

competition among companies supplying practicemanagement software is intense and increasing our future sales of practicemanagement software will depend on among other factors 

 

 

 

 

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software or software enhancements or that such software will be released on time or accepted by the market our software products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot assure you that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software products 

our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers vendors and manufacturers of the products that we distribute 

our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers vendors and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may suffer 

our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management 

our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman and chief executive officer among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 

increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our thirdparty shippers could harm our business 

shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our us orders through united parcel service inc and other delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 

in 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixedrate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our 2300 million senior notes our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 694 and 666 for the 1300 million and 1000 million senior notes respectively the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result 

of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 

we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired including the demedis group and assimilating the operations services products and personnel of each company with our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures accounts receivable and management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would harm our business 

certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 

the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

 

in addition our 1994 stock incentive plan 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and 2001 nonemployee director incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in control 

we also have a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if our board of directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate and in the stockholders’ best interest 

tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect the company’s net earnings and tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the united states securities and exchange commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2005 fiscal year

we believe that our properties are in good condition are well maintained and are suitable and adequate to carry on our business we have additional operating capacity at certain distribution center facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products as a business practice we generally obtain product indemnification from our suppliers 

we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others the manufacturer provides us with indemnification there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection in our opinion all pending matters including those described below are covered by insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition 

as of december 31 2005 we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss this accrued amount as well as related expenses was not material to our financial position results of 

operations or cash flows our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors including probable recoveries from third parties 

product liability claims 

as of december 31 2005 we were a defendant in approximately 42 product liability cases we have obtained defense and indemnification commitments from the manufacturer in many of these cases the manufacturer has withheld indemnification commitments in some of these cases pending product identification in our opinion these cases are covered by insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition

recent developments 

during the third quarter ended september 24 2005 we reached a decision to divest our hospital supply business “hospital supply business” which is a component of our healthcare distribution business the primary reason for this decision was that the hospital supply business does not focus on our core customer namely the officebased practitioner and therefore provides little or no synergies with our core operations 

we have classified the operating results of the hospital supply business as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented in connection with this divestiture we assessed our longlived assets for impairment which resulted in us recording in the third quarter an impairment charge of 119 million 70 million aftertax for the full writedown of all longlived assets including goodwill of 46 million 

on march 6 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our hospital supply business as well as our extended care business the results of which are not material the purchase price is 400 million with 295 million due at closing and 105 million due 90 days after closing subject to certain postclosing contingent payments by us described below the closing is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and our entering into a transition services agreement with the buyer as well as other customary closing conditions based on this sale agreement we expect to record a loss on disposal net 

of tax of between 210 million and 240 million or 024 and 027 per diluted share at the time of closing which will be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations 

we agreed to make payments to the buyer up to a maximum of 130 million contingent upon the collection of specified accounts receivable within one year and contingent upon the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the hospital supply business during the twoyear postclosing period any payments made in connection with these contingencies will be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations 

executive level overview 

we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 500000 customers worldwide including dental practices and laboratories physician practices and veterinary clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 73 years of experience distributing healthcare products 

we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 11000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland israel australia and new zealand we also have an affiliate in iceland 

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment 

we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including veterinary and international operating segments products distributed consist of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infectioncontrol products and vitamins 

our dental group serves officebased dental practices schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased physician practices surgical centers other alternatecare settings veterinarian clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving officebased practices 

our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare providers primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practicemanagement software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 

industry overview 

in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors 

capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for practicemanagement systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 

our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 

industry consolidation 

the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and veterinary markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 21 billion in 2005 in the combined north american and western and central european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 

we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 

our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses 

as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently more than 300 smaller distributors holding approximately 35 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 50 of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that more than 200 competitors hold approximately 80 of the market 

as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur additional merger and acquisitionrelated costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

aging population and other market influences 

the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology 

treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the healthcare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 

the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were aged 85 or older the segment of the population most in need of healthcare services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

as a result of these market dynamics the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published “national health care expenditures projections 2005 – 2015” indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 19 trillion in 2004 or 160 of the nation’s gross domestic product healthcare spending is projected to reach 40 trillion in 2015 an estimated 200 of the nation’s gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states 

governmental influences 

the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act the “medicare act” is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement based upon current information we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional use of generic drugs both of which have potentially positive implications for our pharmaceutical distribution business 

product integrity 

certain pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers are in discussions with legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers’ concerns about the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting as a distributor of such products we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation

 gross profit increased 2625 million or 249 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry in which developers realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development 

healthcare distribution gross profit increased 2573 million or 259 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the prior year period healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased to 275 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 260 for the comparable prior year period primarily due to the absence of fluvirin ® influenza vaccine in 2004 as previously discussed these increases reflect a focus on 

margin improvement including the shedding of certain lower margin pharmaceutical products by our medical business

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions working capital needs capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buyin opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables because sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buyin opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 

we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities private placement debt and stock issuances our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for and supply by our vendors of our products and services given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future we do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources 

net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2651 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 1910 million for the comparable prioryear period this net change of 741 million was due primarily to our increased sales and profit and our management of working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was 1629 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 1718 million for the comparable prior year period the net change of 89 million was primarily due to a combination of items including lower payments for business acquisitions and net cash receipts from the settlements of foreign exchange contracts partially offset by increased capital expenditures and investments we expect to invest approximately 670 million during fiscal year 2006 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations approximately 123 million of such expected capital expenditures relate to a new distribution center in france 

net cash used in financing activities was 389 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 264 million for the prioryear period the net change of 653 million was primarily due to the issuance of convertible debt in the prior year partially offset by repayments of debt acquired through acquisitions in the prior year as well as reduced repurchases of common stock in 2005

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements

ecommerce 

traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings 

through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and veterinary consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 

revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery 

revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 

revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 

accounts receivable and reserves 

the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

inventory and reserves 

inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily by the firstin firstout method in performing our lower of cost or market valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends 

from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment analyses such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including veterinary international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or 

changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include 

 

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 

vendor rebates 

vendor rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned the factors we consider in estimating vendor rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect our financial results 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements trademarks trade names and customer relationships when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates andor assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates andor assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 

stockbased compensation 

through december 31 2005 we accounted for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic valuebased method of accounting prescribed by apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 

we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair valuebased method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stockbased compensation had been applied as required by fas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the fair valuebased method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected riskfree interest rates stock price volatility dividend yield and weightedaverage option life 

as of january 1 2006 in connection with our adoption of fas 123r “sharebased payment” discussed below stockbased compensation is included in our results of operations the method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of stockbased compensation under fas 123r are similar to those used under fas 123 

recently issued accounting standards 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas no 123r “sharebased payment” this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments this statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions this statement does not change the accounting guidance for sharebased payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in fas 123 as originally issued and eitf issue no 9618 “accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services” this statement is effective for us beginning january 1 2006 and applies to all outstanding and unvested stockbased payment awards at the date of adoption 

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” which discussed the sec’s interpretation of fas 123r and the related valuation of sharebased compensation for public companies we are assessing the requirements of both fas 123r and sab 107 and the impact that these pronouncements will have on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share we anticipate the adoption of fas 123r will affect our results of operations to an extent similar to that as presented in our fas 123 pro forma disclosure included in the accompanying audited financial statements 

in may 2005 the fasb issued fas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” fas 154 is a replacement of apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” this statement requires voluntary changes in accounting to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly adopted policy had always been used unless impracticable previously apb opinion no 20 required most voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change in accounting in net income in the period of change this statement also requires a change in method of depreciation amortization or depletion for a longlived asset be accounted for as a change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle fas 154 is effective for us beginning january 1 2006 when adopted this statement could have an impact on prior year consolidated financial statements if we have a change in accounting 

in june 2005 the fasb ratified eitf issue 052 the meaning of “conventional convertible debt instrument” in eitf issue 0019 “accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock” this issue attempts to define “conventional convertible debt instrument” to help clarify the appropriate accounting for such instruments we do not anticipate this issue will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 

interest rate swap agreements 

we have fixed rate senior notes of 1300 million at 694 and 1000 million at 666 during 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 24 million 

as of december 31 2005 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other noncurrent liabilities was 74 million which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 2300 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 

foreign currency agreements 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm ie twelve months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with longterm intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure 

as of december 31 2005 we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of 3956 million of which 3535 million related to intercompany debt and 421 million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors the contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the us dollar for euros 2774 million british pounds 380 million australian dollars 81 million swiss francs 19 million japanese yen 394 thousand and canadian dollars 84 million in addition our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies the notional amount of such contracts was 614 million a hypothetical 5 change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by 163 million 

as of december 31 2005 the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through december 4 2006 recorded in other current assets was 40 million as determined by quoted market prices for the year ended december 31 2005 we had realized net gains of 4 thousand and unrealized gains of 14 million relating to such agreements

limitations of the effectiveness of internal control

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

board of directors henry schein inc melville new york 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that henry schein inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso henry schein inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that henry schein inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso also in our opinion henry schein inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso

 item 1 business general we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 475000 customers worldwide including dental practices and laboratories physician practices and veterinary clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 72 years of experience distributing healthcare products we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 10000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland australia and new zealand we also have affiliates in iceland and israel we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment we conduct our business through two segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution segment consists of our dental medical including veterinary and international groups products distributed consist of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infection control products and vitamins our dental group serves approximately 80 of the estimated 135000 officebased dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market based upon an estimated 47 billion combined united states and canadian dental market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 34 in 2004 our medical group serves approximately 50 of the estimated 250000 officebased physician practices as well as surgical centers and other alternatecare settings throughout the united states we also serve over 70 of the estimated 27000 veterinarian clinics in the united states based upon an estimated 74 billion combined market we estimate our share of this market was approximately 19 in 2004 our international group serves approximately 210000 practices in 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading paneuropean healthcare supplier serving officebased dental medical and veterinary practices based upon an estimated 74 billion western and central european combined dental medical and veterinary market in which we operate we estimate our share of this market was approximately 12 in 2004 our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare providers primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 3

industry the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and veterinary markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 195 billion in 2004 in the combined north american and western and central european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations comprising anywhere from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an officebased healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one distributor generally serving as the primary supplier the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from hospitals to alternatecare sites particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base competition the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors like us in the united states we compete with other distributors as well as several major manufacturers of dental medical and veterinary products primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our principal national competitor is patterson companies inc formerly patterson dental company in addition we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national regional and local level our principal competitors in the sale of medical products are pss world medical inc the general medical division of mckesson corp and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national distributors in the veterinary market our two principal national competitors include the butler company and burns veterinary supply inc we also compete against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians with regard to our practice management software we compete against numerous other firms including firms such as practiceworks inc a subsidiary of the eastman kodak company which primarily targets dental practices and idexx laboratories inc which serves veterinary practices we compete in canada substantially on the same basis as in the united states 4

we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors including the gacd group pluradent ag  co planmeca oy omega pharma nv and bilricay as well as a large number of dental product distributors and manufacturers in the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria ireland portugal and spain significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results competitive strengths we have more than 72 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “henry schein” name our competitive strengths include

   markets served demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us population is increasingly using healthcare services between 2003 and 2010 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 16 and between 2003 and 2020 the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 32 this compares with expected total us population growth rates of 7 between 2003 and 2010 and 16 between 2003 and 2020 in the dental industry there is predicted to be an attendant rise in oral healthcare expenditures as this segment of the population increases cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients seek at the same time there is an increase in dental insurance coverage approximately 57 of the us population now has some form of dental coverage up from 47 in 1995 we support our dental professionals through the many skus we offer as well as through important valueadded services including practice management software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing education all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency and profitability we believe our medical group is the fastest growing distributor among the major competitors in the physician and alternatecare markets there continues to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians’ offices a trend that may provide additional opportunity for us there is also the continuing use of vaccines injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternatecare settings we believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the officebased medical practitioner we believe our international group is a leading paneuropean healthcare supplier servicing officebased dental and medical practices we are in the process of attempting to replicate our us infrastructure in europe additionally we are expanding our dental fullservice model throughout europe and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist through our “schein direct” program we can provide doortodoor air package delivery to practitioners in 125 countries around the world on june 18 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of demedis gmbh excluding its austrian operations which we believe to be a leading fullservice distributor of dental consumables and equipment in germany austria and the benelux countries and euro dental holding gmbh which included krugg spa italy’s leading distributor of dental consumable products and dentalmv gmbh otherwise known as muller  weygandt or “mw” we refer to these entities collectively as the “demedis group” as part of our agreement with the german regulatory authorities we agreed to divest mw shortly after the consummation of the acquisition effected through exercising a put option back to the previous owners on july 16 2004 this divestiture was completed for eur 500 million or 622 million including the 8

assumption of debt of approximately eur 275 million or 342 million resulting in a reduction of the purchase price for the demedis group as part of the agreement to divest mw we were entitled to receive 50 of the net sale proceeds in excess of eur 550 million in the event mw was subsequently resold before june 18 2005 on september 24 2004 an agreement was signed to resell mw for an amount that resulted in our realizing a share of the net sales proceeds equal to eur 264 million or 324 million which we received in october 2004 this amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price for the demedis group the regulatory authorities are continuing their review of our pending acquisition of the demedis group’s business in austria which operates under the austrodent brand of the total purchase price for the demedis group eur 110 million or 135 million was attributable to austrodent which was included in other current assets as of december 25 2004 in the event that we receive regulatory approval to acquire austrodent this amount will be reclassified based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a purchase price allocation with an increase to goodwill for any excess of purchase price over fair value in the event that we do not receive regulatory approval to acquire austrodent we are entitled to receive the proceeds through a sale of austrodent net of selling costs up to eur 110 million any shortfall between the eur 110 million and the proceeds received upon a subsequent sale of austrodent will be recorded as an addition to goodwill of the demedis group we financed the acquisition of the demedis group primarily with cash on hand with borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the amount of 1500 million these borrowings were repaid in full with the net proceeds from the issuance of 2400 million of longterm convertible debt on august 9 2004 the operating results of the demedis group including mw which was accounted for using the equity method through the date of the divestiture and excluding austrodent are included in the accompanying financial statements since the acquisition date of june 18 2004 seasonality and other factors affecting our business we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including   9

 any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline ecommerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships positions us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities governmental regulations our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws applicable to us are the federal food drug and cosmetic act the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the controlled substances act the federal food drug and cosmetic act generally regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging storage handling marketing and distribution of and record keeping for pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be registered with the secretary of health and human services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct business in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage handling and record maintenance under the controlled substances act as a distributor of controlled substances we are required to obtain a registration annually from the attorney general in accordance with specified rules and regulations and are subject to inspection by the drug enforcement administration acting on behalf of the attorney general we are required to maintain licenses and permits for the distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of the states in which we operate in addition our dentist and physician customers are subject to significant governmental regulation there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business we believe that we are in compliance with the foregoing laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business 10

actual results we undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forwardlooking statements recent developments on october 5 2004 chiron corporation announced that it would not supply fluvirin® influenza vaccine to the us market for the current influenza season as a result of action by the uk regulatory body the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra to temporarily suspend its license to manufacture fluvirin® influenza vaccine in chiron’s liverpool uk facility on october 15 2004 based on the us food and drug administration’s fda evaluation and inspection of chiron’s liverpool uk manufacturing facility the fda announced that none of the influenza vaccine manufactured by chiron for the us market was safe for use we are the primary distributor of fluvirin® to the us market and chiron is currently our primary supplier of the influenza vaccine on december 2 2004 we entered into a multiyear agreement terminating in 2014 with id biomedical corporation to distribute id biomedical’s fluviral® influenza vaccine the agreement will commence upon approval of fluviral® by the fda which could be as early as 2005 if the fda provides expedited approval of the id biomedical application and will terminate in 2014 once fluviral® is approved by the fda id biomedical plans to manufacture up to an estimated 15 million doses for the us market in 2005 and increase production to approximately 38 million doses by 2007 similarly we will increase the number of fluviral® doses we purchase over that time and by 2007 will have approximately 19 million doses per year available for distribution to our customers on march 2 2005 chiron announced that it received notice from the mhra that the agency has lifted the license suspension for chiron’s liverpool uk manufacturing facility the decision is conditioned on the understanding that chiron’s level of commitment to the completion of its remediation plan and ongoing improvements must continue chiron is required to provide the mhra with regular weekly updates to ensure that progress on its various projects proceeds satisfactorily and the mhra may conduct further inspections on march 2 2005 the fda announced that it has been working closely with the mhra including during inspections as the agency evaluates chiron’s progress in correcting their manufacturing problems the fda plans to conduct a comprehensive inspection of chiron’s liverpool uk manufacturing facility to ensure that chiron can produce a safe and effective vaccine once all critical stages of manufacturing are fully operational and needed corrective actions can be fully evaluated given the significant uncertainty about whether fluvirin® will be available for the 20052006 influenza season in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a pretax onetime charge of approximately 132 million related to our fluvirin® contract this charge represented the writeoff of a deferred expense associated with the 20052006 influenza season executivelevel overview we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to officebased healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than 475000 customers worldwide including dental practices and laboratories physician practices and veterinary clinics 20

as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 72 years of experience distributing healthcare products we are headquartered in melville new york employ nearly 10000 people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland australia and new zealand we also have affiliates in iceland and israel we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment we conduct our business through two segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution segment consists of our dental medical including veterinary and international groups products distributed consist of consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infection control products and vitamins our dental group serves officebased dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves officebased physician practices as well as surgical centers and other alternatecare settings and veterinarian clinics throughout the united states our international group serves practices in 17 countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading paneuropean healthcare supplier serving officebased dental medical and veterinary practices our technology group provides software technology and other valueadded services to healthcare providers primarily in the united states and canada our valueadded practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners industry overview in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices this trend has also accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at low prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably impact demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business both domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements industry consolidation the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to officebased healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and veterinary markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately 195 billion in 2004 in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations comprising anywhere from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 21

due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent smallquantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decision within an officebased healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas which complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses on june 18 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of the demedis group excluding its austrian operations this acquisition approximately doubled the net sales of our international operations additionally since the beginning of 1999 we have completed more than 25 acquisitions as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently more than 300 smaller distributors holding approximately 40 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 50 of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that more than 200 competitors hold approximately 80 of the market as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in hospitals to the alternatecare site particularly physicians’ offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the eldercare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in america will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were age 85 years and older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and eldercare services by the year 2040 that number is 22

projected to more than triple to over 14 million the population segment age 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period as a result of these market dynamics the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms office of the actuary published “health spending projections through 2013” in 2004 indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 16 trillion in 2002 or 149 of the nation’s gross domestic product healthcare spending is projected to reach 34 trillion in 2013 an estimated 184 of the gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states governmental influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and overall financial viability of these institutions the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act the “medicare act” is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits effective in 2006 with an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement based upon current information we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of generic drugs both of which have potentially positive implications for the pharmaceutical distribution portion of our business product integrity certain pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers are in discussions with legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers’ concerns regarding the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting as a distributor of such products we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation 23

as previously discussed in the ‘recent developments’ section we have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from chiron corporation and id biomedical corporation given the uncertainties surrounding the pending fda approval for both companies to distribute influenza vaccine in the us for the 20052006 influenza season we have excluded these purchase obligations from the above table our purchase commitment under our agreement with chiron corporation would require us to pay 1225 million in 2005 if they are able to meet their obligations under the agreement our purchase commitment under our agreement with id biomedical which terminates in 2014 would require us to pay an amount per dose based each year on the market price then prevailing under current market prices this commitment would aggregate to approximately 450 million for 2005 increasing to approximately 1130 million in 2007 and each year thereafter on august 9 2004 we completed an issuance of 2400 million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30 and are due to mature on august 15 2034 interest on the notes is payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year which commenced on february 15 2005 the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is the equivalent conversion price of 4634 per share upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our 2000 million revolving credit facility along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation in prior years we completed private placement transactions under which we issued 1300 million and 1000 million in senior notes the 1300 million notes come due on june 30 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 694 per annum principal payments totaling 200 million are due annually starting september 25 2006 on the 1000 million notes and bear interest at a fixed rate of 666 per annum interest on both notes is payable semiannually during the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into agreements relating to the 2300 million senior notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates for the year ended december 25 2004 the weightedaverage variable interest rate was 505 this weightedaverage variable interest rate comprises libor plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 32

we have a revolving credit facility of 2000 million that is a fouryear committed line scheduled to expire in may 2006 we financed our acquisition of the demedis group with cash on hand borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the amount of 1500 million these borrowings were repaid in full as of december 25 2004 with the net proceeds from our 2400 million convertible debt issuance on august 9 2004 as of december 25 2004 there were 80 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility as of december 25 2004 we had available various shortterm bank credit lines of which 60 million was outstanding such credit lines bear interest at rates ranging from 30 to 625 and were collateralized by accounts receivable inventory and property and equipment with an aggregate net carrying value of 253 million at december 25 2004 on june 21 2004 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a second common stock repurchase program the new program allows us to repurchase up to 100 million in shares of our common stock which represented approximately 35 of shares outstanding on the announcement date as of december 25 2004 we had repurchased 362 million or 1168810 shares under this initiative some holders of minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price as defined in the agreements additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements we believe that our cash and cash equivalents ability to access public and private debt markets and public equity markets and available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and veterinary consumable products as well as dental equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contrarevenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped using thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of 33

the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although making changes to our judgments estimates andor assumptions would affect our financial results we believe the effect would not likely be material goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although making changes to our judgments estimates andor assumptions would affect our financial results we believe the effect would not likely be material we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include  if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets have been impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income based on our impairment review process we have not recorded any material impairments during 2004 2003 or 2002 longlived assets longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from assets definitelived intangible assets primarily 34

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments all interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure not for speculation interest rate swaps we have fixed rate senior notes of 1300 million at 694 and 1000 million at 666 during the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates payable on the 2300 million senior notes the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 28 million as of december 25 2004 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other noncurrent liabilities was 14 million which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to noncurrent assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the 2300 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase shortterm foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with longterm intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting not an economic exposure 36

as of december 25 2004 we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts aggregating 4472 million of which 4402 million related to intercompany debt and 70 million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of euros 3715 million british pounds 570 million australian dollars 111 million swedish krona 40 million swiss francs 28 million japanese yen 5900 thousand and new zealand dollars 265 thousand as of december 25 2004 the gross amount of these contracts calculated as the aggregate value of future us dollar payments and receipts determined by quoted market prices was 4484 million these contracts expire through june 2005 for the year ended december 25 2004 we recognized a loss relating to our foreign currency forward and swap contracts of 892 thousand risk factors the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully we compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to endusers and bypass distributors like us industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors the unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from manufacturers or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition in the future we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues the healthcare industry is experiencing changes which could adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans pressures relating to potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare distribution companies collective purchasing arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners and reimbursements to customers if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely affected in addition the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business we must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and additional regulations could negatively affect our business our business is subject to requirements under various local state federal and international governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act and the federal food drug and cosmetic act including the prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the safe medical devices act such laws    37

    our business is also subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad the failure to comply with any of these regulations or the imposition of any additional regulations could negatively affect our business there can be no assurance that current or future us or foreign government regulations will not adversely affect our business our international operations are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect our operating results international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the risks that our international operations are subject to include          as a result of our acquisition of the demedis group our foreign operations are significantly larger and therefore our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations has become greater we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine equipment and software products purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and yearend promotions net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors including 38

      any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate if our operating results do not meet market expectations our stock price may decline because we do not manufacture the products we distribute we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products we obtain substantially all of our products from thirdparty suppliers generally we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us therefore suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control in the event that any of our thirdparty suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all an extended interruption in the supply of our products including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product would have an adverse effect on our results of operations which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves several risks we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future such transactions involve numerous risks including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures    there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following    39

 we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products additionally we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of products by that entity one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain in addition some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability we have insurance policies including product liability insurance covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate additionally in many cases we are covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product however we cannot assure you that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover future claims that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for us a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or indemnification or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could harm our business our technology segment depends upon continued product development technical support and successful marketing competition among companies supplying practice management software is intense and increasing our future sales of practice management software will depend on among other factors    we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software or software enhancements or that such software will be released on time or accepted by the market our software products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released we cannot be sure that future problems with postrelease software errors or bugs will not occur any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software we do not have any patents on our software and rely upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections we cannot assure you that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software products our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers vendors and manufacturers of the products we distribute our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers vendors and manufacturers if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future our business may suffer our future performance is materially dependent upon our senior management our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management particularly stanley m bergman chairman chief executive officer and president among others the loss of the services of mr bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business we have an employment agreement with mr bergman we do not currently have “key man” life insurance 40

policies on any of our employees competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third party shippers could harm our business shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business we ship almost all of our us orders by united parcel service inc and other delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to costeffectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed rate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our 230 million senior notes our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 694 and 666 for the 130 million and 100 million senior notes respectively the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates for example a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 28 million our acquisition of the demedis group may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect on june 18 2004 we acquired the demedis group we are in the process of integrating these companies and assimilating the operations services products and personnel of each company with our management policies procedures and strategies we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from this acquisition or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with this acquisition to effectively manage our expected future growth we must continue to successfully manage our integration of the demedis group and continue to improve our operational systems internal procedures accounts receivable and management financial and operational controls if we fail in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including    41

    in addition the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies this type of litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which would harm our business certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage thirdparty offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things    in addition the henry schein inc 1994 stock incentive plan the henry schein inc 1996 nonemployee director stock incentive plan and the henry schein inc 2001 nonemployee director stock option plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in control we also have a stockholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if our board of directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate and in the stockholders’ best interest 42

the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december 27 2003 in thousands  

industry overview in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices this trend has also accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at low prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably impact demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management our operating results in recent years have been significantly impacted by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business both domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements industry consolidation the officebased healthcare practitioner industry in the geographic markets in which we operate is highly fragmented and diverse encompassing the dental medical and veterinary markets this industry accounted for revenues of approximately 17 billion in 2003 the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations comprised of between a few and a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices due in part to the inability of officebased healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to officebased healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decision within an officebased healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant and supplies and small 23 

equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier we believe that consolidation within the supply industry serving officebased healthcare practitioners will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly companies with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product offerings and expand the services they can offer or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement our existing operations and b provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses as previously discussed we are currently awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition of demedis a leading fullservice distributor of dental consumables and equipment in germany austria and the benelux countries and edh which includes krugg spa italy’s leading distributor of dental consumable products and dentalmv gmbh otherwise know as muller  weygandt one of europe’s leading direct marketing distributors of dental consumable products these acquisitions will approximately double the net sales of our international operations see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements additionally we have completed 22 acquisitions in the past five years including 8 in 2003 as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently over 300 smaller distributors holding approximately 40 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that over 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 60 of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that over 200 competitors hold approximately 80 of the market as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded thirdparty insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in hospitals to the alternate site particularly physician offices despite significantly lower pricing of hospital medical products as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the elder care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans the january 2000 us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in america will more than double by the year 2040 in 2000 four million americans were age 85 years and older the segment of the population most in need of longterm care and elder care services by the year 2040 that number is projected to more than triple to over 14 million the population age 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period 24 

as a result of these market dynamics the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the us the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms office of the actuary published “health spending projections through 2013” in 2004 indicating that total national healthcare spending reached 16 trillion in 2002 or 149 of the nation’s gross domestic product healthcare spending is projected to reach 34 trillion in 2013 an estimated 184 of the gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the us governmental influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care during 1997 the balanced budget act passed by congress significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and overall financial viability of these institutions the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act the “medicare act” was passed by congress and enacted by president bush on december 8 2003 the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits effective in 2006 with an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement based upon current information we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of generic drugs both of which have potentially positive implications for our pharmaceutical distribution business product integrity certain pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and legislators are in discussions regarding the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and the manufacturers’ concerns regarding the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting as a distributor of such products we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and with potential litigation 25

 for the year ended december 28 2002 our net sales increased 2668 million or 104 from the comparable prior year period of the increase in total net sales 2563 million or 961 resulted from a 102 increase in our healthcare distribution business of this increase 1059 million resulted from a 94 increase in our dental business 1114 million resulted from an 113 increase in our medical business and 390 million resulted from a 98 increase in our international business the remaining increase in net sales of 105 million resulted from an 187 increase in our technology business the 1059 million or 94 increase in dental net sales consisted of an increase in dental consumable merchandise of 659 million or 73 and dental equipment of 400 million or 185 the increase in dental net sales was primarily due to increased dental equipment sales and increased account penetration of existing customers driven by our privileges loyalty program the 1114 million or 113 increase in medical net sales was primarily due to increased sales to physicians’ office and alternate care markets the 390 million or 98 increase in international net sales was primarily due to increased account penetration in france united kingdom and australia and favorable exchange rates excluding the effect of the exchange rates net sales for the international market increased 187 million or 47 the increase in technology net sales of 105 million or 187 was primarily due to increased sales of valueadded products including software products and related services including the impact of a new marketing initiative marketone under this initiative certain technology and equipment products were sold directly to enduser customers beginning with the third quarter of 2002 rather than through resellers which resulted in a higher growth rate for the technology business without this change the technology business net sales would have increased by 139 29

selling general and administrative expenses increased 470 million or 85 to 5986 million for the year ended december 28 2002 compared to the prior year period as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 212 from 216 for the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to lower rent costs in our healthcare distribution business as a percentage of sales realized through leveraging our infrastructure as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses selling and shipping expenses increased 360 million or 108 to 3701 million for the year ended december 28 2002 from 3341 million for the prior year period the increase was primarily due to expenses directly associated with supporting increased sales volume as a percentage of net sales selling and shipping expenses remained constant at 131 compared to the prior year period as a component of total selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 110 million or 51 to 2285 million for the year ended december 28 2002 from 2175 million for the prior year period as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased to 81 30 

from 85 for the comparable prior year period the decrease was primary due to the elimination of goodwill amortization expense with the adoption of fas 142 other expense net other expense net decreased by 825 thousand to 66 million for the year ended december 28 2002 compared to the prior year period the net decrease was primarily due to the favorable settlement of a real estate transaction income taxes for the year ended december 28 2002 our effective tax rate was 372 compared to 370 for the comparable prior year period the difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes net income net income increased 306 million or 350 to 1180 for the year ended december 28 2002 compared to the prior year a real estate transaction gain of 890 thousand a restructuring accrual reversal of 734 thousand and the effect of the implementation of fas 142 at the beginning of 2002 which ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets of approximately 73 million are included in 2002 net income the effect that such transactions had on diluted earnings per share was 020 in 2002 liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs acquisitions repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures resulting from increased sales and special inventory forward buyin opportunities pursuing growth opportunities and managing funding needs since sales tend to be strong during the fourth quarter and special inventory forward buyin opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities private placement loans and stock issuances our principal source of cash is derived from our operations our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1288 million for the year ended december 27 2003 compared to 1347 million for the prior year period this decrease was primarily due to increased trade receivable and inventory levels as of december 27 2003 resulting from increased end of year sales and purchase activity for 2003 compared to 2002 net cash used in investing activities was 1181 million for the year ended december 27 2003 compared to 1428 million for the prior year period the decrease was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds received from the sale and maturity of marketable securities and a reduction in capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions we expect to invest approximately between 35 million and 40 million during fiscal year 2004 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities on computer infrastructure systems and to integrate operations 31 

net cash used in financing activities was 484 million for the year ended december 27 2003 compared to 187 million provided by financing activities for the comparable prior year period the net change was primarily due to payments made to repurchase our common stock and a reduction in the proceeds received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options partially offset by lower principal payments on longterm debt on march 12 2003 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock which represented approximately 45 of shares outstanding on the announcement date during the year ended december 27 2003 we repurchased and retired 1335000 shares at an average price of 4626 per share the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands  

 our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds these investments have staggered maturity dates none of which exceed three months and have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are traded in public markets our marketable securities consist of short and longterm debt securities classified as available for sale including corporate bonds rated aaa by moody’s or an equivalent rating and commercial paper rated p1 by moody’s or an equivalent rating the fair values of our marketable securities are determined by quoted market prices our business requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity special inventory forward buyin opportunities new customer buildup requirements and the desired level of investment inventory working capital has increased primarily as a result of our higher sales volume our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 464 days for the year ended december 27 2003 from 482 days for the comparable prior year period primarily due to our continued focus on actively pursuing collection of aged receivables and tightening credit standards our inventory turns improved to 69 turns for the year ended december 27 2003 from 66 turns for the prior year as a result of increased sales of higher turnover products we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continued sales growth 32 

the following table shows our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate longterm debt excluding interest as well as lease obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of december 27 2003 see notes 8 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements  

in prior years we completed private placement transactions under which we issued 1300 million and 1000 million in senior notes the 1300 million notes come due on june 30 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 694 per annum principal payments totaling 200 million are due annually starting september 25 2006 on the 1000 million notes and bear interest at a fixed rate of 666 per annum interest on both notes is payable semiannually during the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into agreements relating to the 2300 million senior notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the weightedaverage variable interest rate is 425 this weightedaverage variable interest rate is comprised of libor plus the spread and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes we have a revolving credit facility of 2000 million that is a fouryear committed line scheduled to terminate in may 2006 there were no borrowings under this credit facility as of december 27 2003 as of december 27 2003 certain of our subsidiaries had revolving credit facilities which had outstanding balances of 61 million against aggregate borrowing limits of 326 million in connection with our pending acquisition of demedis and edh for approximately 255 million euros as previously discussed after making a deposit on january 20 2004 of 35 million euros we will be paying approximately 220 million euros at closing the remaining purchase price will be paid from existing cash resources andor the proceeds of i a bridge loan andor ii the issuance or sale in a public or private placement of equity interests or notes debentures or other debt securities or another debt financing with a maturity in excess of one year in any case a “permanent financing” we have obtained commitments for a 1500 million bridge loan facility scheduled to mature on the sixmonth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition the bridge loan will be unsecured and will bear interest at our option at libor plus 0925 or the prime rate we intend to refinance the bridge loan by means of a permanent financing or if a permanent financing can be arranged prior to the consummation of the acquisition we will pay the purchase price with the proceeds of such permanent financing the acquisition is subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close midyear 2004 some holders of minority interests in entities we have acquired have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price based on earnings of the entity additionally some prior owners of acquired businesses are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions since the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 33 

we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments in short and longterm marketable securities ability to access public and private debt and equity markets and availability of funds under our existing credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and longterm capital needs seasonality and other factors affecting our business our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences net sales and operating profits are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters due to timing of seasonal product sales software and equipment sales yearend promotions and purchasing patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and are generally lower in the first quarter primarily due to the increased purchases in the prior quarter quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other factors including the timing of acquisitions and related costs timing of sales special promotional campaigns fluctuations in exchange rates and adverse weather conditions ecommerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are impacted by the advancement of electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and is highly competitive the rapid advancement of online commerce requires us to provide continuous improvement in performance security features and reliability of internet content and technology particularly in response to competitive offerings through our proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships positions us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate estimates including those related to sales allowance provisions as described below volume purchase rebates income taxes inventory and bad debt reserves and contingencies we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and veterinary consumable products as well as dental equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to 34 

customers customer returns and other adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail highvolume lowdollar orders shipped utilizing thirdparty common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no postshipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from postcontract customer support for software including annual support andor training is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are provided revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “fas” no 141 “business combinations” and no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include the following    if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income based on our 2003 impairment review process we have not recorded any impairments during the year ended december 27 2003 35 

longlived assets longlived assets other than goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of such assets other definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives such definitelived intangible assets primarily consist of noncompete agreements and customer relationships when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value we have not recorded any impairments during the year ended december 27 2003 stockbased compensation we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic valuebased method of accounting prescribed by apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair valuebased method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stockbased compensation had been applied as required by fas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the fair valuebased method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected riskfree interest rates stock price volatility dividend yield and weightedaverage option life recently issued accounting standards in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to fas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” this statement does not change the measurement or recognition aspects for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans however it does revise employers’ disclosures to include more information about the plan assets obligations to pay benefits and funding obligations fas 132 as revised was effective for our 2003 consolidated financial statements the adoption of fas 132 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in may 2003 the fasb issued fas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” fas no 150 clarifies the definition of a liability as currently defined in fasb concepts statement no 6 “elements of financial statements” as well as other planned revisions this statement requires a financial instrument that embodies an obligation of an issuer to be classified as a liability in addition the statement establishes standards for the initial and subsequent measurement of these financial instruments and disclosure requirements fas 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 for all instruments entered into or last modified prior to may 31 2003 fas 150 was effective at the beginning of our third quarter of 2003 the adoption of fas 150 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in april 2003 the fasb issued fas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” fas no 149 amends fas no 133 for decisions made by the fasb’s derivatives implementation group other fasb projects dealing with financial instruments and in response to implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative this statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of fas 149 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and in december 2003 a revised interpretation was issued fin no 46r in general a variable 36

industry overview

     the officebased healthcare practitioner industry in the geographic
markets in which we operate is highly fragmented and diverse encompassing the
dental medical and veterinary markets this industry accounted for revenues of
approximately 163 billion in 2002 the industry ranges from sole practitioners
working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service
organizations comprised of a few to a large number of practitioners who have
combined or otherwise associated their practices due in part to the inability
of officebased practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies
in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to
officebased healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by
frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and
substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decision within an
officebased healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or by an
administrative assistant and supplies and small equipment are generally
purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the
primary supplier

     we believe that consolidation within the supply industry serving
officebased healthcare practitioners will result in a number of distributors
particularly companies with limited financial and marketing resources seeking
to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth this
consolidation may also result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that
can enhance their current product offerings and expand the services they can
offer or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base

     in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost
containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad
array of products and services at low prices this trend has also accelerated
the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective
buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at low
prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management
information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the
potential to favorably impact demand for practice management systems and
software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitate the management of the
practice

sales and marketing strategies

customers

     through our healthcare distribution and technology businesses we serve
over 400000 customers worldwide in the dental and medical markets no single
customer accounted for more than 13 of our net sales in 2002 our dental
customers include officebased dental practices dental laboratories
universities institutions government agencies and large group accounts
medical customers include

                                        2
page

officebased physician practices podiatrists surgery centers institutions
hospitals government agencies and officebased veterinarians serving primarily
small companion animals

     we believe that our healthcare distribution customers generally order from
two or more suppliers for their healthcare product needs and often use one
supplier as their primary resource we also believe that our customers generally
place larger orders and order more frequently from their primary suppliers we
estimate that in 2002 we served as primary supplier to less than 15 of our
total customer base and believe we have an opportunity to increase sales by
increasing our level of business with those customers for which we serve as a
secondary supplier

     over the past several years we have expanded our customer base to include
larger purchasing organizations including dental laboratories institutions
government agencies hospitals and surgery centers more recently as cost
containment pressures have resulted in increased demand for lowcost products
and valueadded services we have targeted specific groups of practices under
common ownership institutions and professional groups for example we have an
exclusive direct marketing agreement with an american medical association
ama sponsored service pursuant to which member practitioners have access to
the services lower prices for products in 2002 the ama sponsored service
accounted for net sales of approximately 315 million these organizations
government institutions and agencies hospitals and other large or collective
purchasers require lowcost pricing and detailed product and usage information
and reporting we believe that we are well situated to meet the needs of these
customers given our broad offerings of lowcost products and our management
information systems capabilities

sales and marketing

     our 70 years of healthcare distribution experience has helped to build the
henry scheinr brand among our customers our sales and marketing efforts are
designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal
visits by field sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact
emphasizing our broad product lines competitive prices and ease of order
placement the key elements of our program are

     field sales consultants

          we have over 1350 field sales consultants including equipment sales
     specialists covering major north american and international markets these
     field sales consultants concentrate on attracting new customers and
     increasing sales to existing customers this strategy is designed to
     complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and to enable us to
     better market service and support the sale of more sophisticated products
     and equipment once a field sales consultant has established a relationship
     with a customer the consultant encourages the customer to use our
     automated ordering process or telesales representatives for the customers
     daytoday needs this reduces the ordering requirements for the customer
     and increases the effectiveness of the field sales consultant we have
     career development initiatives for our field sales consultants that are
     designed to supplement the consultants skill set to provide valueadded
     practice management services to our customers

     direct marketing

          during 2002 we distributed over 22 million pieces of direct marketing
     material including catalogs flyers order stuffers and other promotional
     materials to over 650000 officebased healthcare practitioners our
     principal printed us dental consumable catalog which is issued annually
     contains over 500 pages and includes approximately 26000 skus the number
     of catalogs and other direct marketing materials received by each customer
     depends upon their practice specialty as well as their purchasing history
     our catalogs include detailed descriptions and specifications of both
     branded and private brand products and are utilized by healthcare
     practitioners as a reference source by identifying our customers
     purchasing patterns area of specialty past

                                        3

     product selections and other criteria we are able to identify customers
     who may respond better to specific promotions or products to facilitate
     our direct marketing activities we maintain an inhouse advertising
     department that we believe streamlines the production process provides
     greater flexibility and creativity in catalog production and results in
     cost savings

     telesales

          we support our direct marketing effort with almost 800 inbound and
     outbound telesales representatives who facilitate order processing and
     generate new sales through direct and frequent contact with customers
     inbound telesales representatives are responsible for assisting customers
     in purchasing decisions as well as answering product pricing and
     availability questions in addition to assisting customers inbound
     telesales representatives also market complementary or promotional
     products our telesales representatives utilize online technology to enter
     customer orders and to access information about products product
     availability pricing promotions and customer preferences and history

          we utilize outbound telesales activities to market our services to
     customer accounts that we identify as either being high volume or high
     frequency order accounts outbound telesales representatives strive to
     manage longterm relationships with these customers through frequent andor
     regularly scheduled phone contact and personalized service

          our telesales representatives generally participate in training
     courses designed to familiarize them with our products services and
     systems in addition telesales representatives attend periodic training
     sessions and special sales programs and receive incentives including
     monthly commissions

customer service

     a principal element of our customer service approach is a customer order
entry process that is convenient easy and flexible customers typically place
orders through one of our experienced telesales representatives customers may
place orders 24 hours a day 7 days a week 247 by mail fax telephone
email and using our computerized order entry systems known as arubar
windows arubar ez or arubar touchtone our 247 automated phone service
and the internet at wwwhenryscheincom or wwwsullivanscheincom the
information contained on our websites is not a part of this form 10k

     we focus on providing rapid and accurate order fulfillment and high fill
rates we estimate that approximately 99 of all items ordered in the united
states and canada are shipped without back ordering and that approximately 99
of all orders in the united states and canada received before 500 pm are
shipped on the same day the order is received in addition because we seek to
service a customers entire order from the distribution center nearest the
customers facility approximately 99 of all orders are received within two
days of placing the order we frequently monitor our customer service through
customer surveys focus groups and daily statistical reports we maintain a
liberal return policy to help bolster customer satisfaction

infrastructure strategy

information systems

     our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key
functions including accounts receivable inventory accounts payable payroll
purchasing sales and order fulfillment a key attribute of our management
information systems is the daily operating control reports that allow managers
throughout our organization to share information and monitor daily progress
relating to sales activity gross profit credit and returns inventory levels
stock balancing unshipped orders order fulfillment and other operational
statistics we continually seek to enhance and upgrade our order processing
information system in the united states we have recently introduced fieldcom
a new dental equipment service and repair technology tool that provides an
immediate and paperless communication link between our service and repair
technicians and us additionally in the united states we have installed an
integrated information system for our large dental equipment sales and service
functions such systems centralize the tracking of customers equipment orders
as well as spare parts inventories and repair services

distribution

     we distribute our products in the united states primarily from our
strategically located distribution centers in eastern central south eastern
south western and western united states customers in

                                       6
page

canada are serviced from distribution centers located in eastern and western
canada we maintain appropriate inventory levels in order to satisfy customer
demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment of their product
needs these inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our
sophisticated purchasing and stock status management information systems once a
customers order is entered it is electronically transmitted to the
distribution center nearest the customers location and a packing slip for the
entire order is printed for order fulfillment our automated freight manifesting
and laser bar code scanning facilitates the speed of the order fulfillment we
currently ship substantially all of our orders in the united states by united
parcel service in certain areas of the united states we deliver our orders via
contract carriers our international distribution centers include locations in
the united kingdom france the netherlands germany spain australia and new
zealand

purchasing

     we believe that effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and
enhancing our position as a lowcost provider of healthcare products we
frequently evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers offerings and
prices in order to obtain products at the best possible cost we believe that
our ability to make high volume purchases has enabled us to obtain favorable
pricing and terms from our suppliers we obtain the products for our north
american distribution centers from about 2300 suppliers of name brand products
in addition we have established relationships with numerous local vendors to
obtain products for our international distribution centers in 2002 our top 10
healthcare distribution vendors and our single largest vendor accounted for
approximately 319 and 66 respectively of our aggregate purchases

growth strategies

     we pursue growth in the following ways first we seek to increase sales to
our existing customer base and enhance our position as a prime vendor we
estimate that we are the primary vendor to less than 15 of our customers for
example in the us dental market total consumable sales per practitioner are
estimated to be approximately 25000 of which our average us dental
customers sales are approximately 8000 or 32 of those sales in the us
medical market total sales per practitioner are estimated to be 12000 of which
our average us medical customers sales are approximately 4000 or 33 of
those sales in the western european dental market total sales per practitioner
are estimated to be approximately 20000 of which our average western european
dental customers sales are approximately 3000 or 15 of those sales

     to increase market share we seek to expand our dental equipment sales and
services this includes selling digital xray and intraoral imaging to existing
customers as well as to providing innovative valueadded services to help our
customers run more efficient and profitable practices these valueadded
services include practice management software systems electronic claims and
credit card processing we processed approximately 23 million claims during
2002 practice and patient financing equipment leasing and continuing
education

     our second growth strategy is to increase the total number of customers we
serve we estimate that 5560 of us medical practices and 45 of western
european dental practices are not customers of the company we believe that
there is substantial opportunity in the western european medical market as well
this strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales
consultants as well as utilizing our customer database to focus our marketing
efforts

     our third growth strategy is to increase crossselling efforts of key
product lines in the dental business we have significant crossselling
opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our over
90000 dental distribution customers in the medical business we have
opportunities to expand our vaccine injectables and other pharmaceuticals
sales to medical distribution customers as well as crossselling core products
with these key products like dental the veterinary

                                       7
page

business provides opportunities for crossselling between our veterinary
practice management software users and our estimated 17000 veterinary
distribution clients

     finally we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions we believe that
there has been consolidation among healthcare product distributors serving
officebased healthcare practitioners and that this trend will continue to
create opportunities for us to expand through acquisitions in recent years we
have acquired a number of companies engaged in businesses that are complementary
to us our acquisition strategy includes acquiring targets that will provide
additional sales that will be channeled through our existing infrastructure
acquiring access to additional product lines acquiring regional distributors
with networks of field sales consultants and expanding internationally we have
completed 20 acquisitions in the past five years

     as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to
capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased
sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we
estimate that there are currently over 300 smaller distributors holding
approximately 40 of the market in the us medical market we estimate that
over 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 60 of the market and in the
european dental market we estimate that over 200 smaller competitors hold
approximately 80 market share

competition

     the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is
highly competitive many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are
available to our customers from a number of suppliers in addition our
competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market
particular products manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to
endusers and thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors like us

     in the united states we compete with other distributors as well as
several major manufacturers of dental medical and veterinary products
primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and
valueadded products and services in the sale of our dental products our
principal national competitor is patterson dental company in addition we
compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national
regional and local level our principal competitors in the sale of medical
products are pss world medical inc the general medical division of mckesson
corp and the allegiance division of cardinal health inc which are national
distributors in the veterinary market our two principal national competitors
include the butler company and burns veterinary supply inc we also compete
against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors as
well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and
veterinarians with regard to our practice management software we compete
against numerous other firms including firms such as practiceworks inc which
primarily targets dental practices and idexx laboratories inc which serves
veterinary practices we believe that we compete in canada substantially on the
same basis as in the united states

     we also face significant competition internationally where we compete on
the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors
including demedis dental deport gmbh the gacd group the pluradent ag  co
and bilricay as well as a large number of dental product distributors and
manufacturers in the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france
austria ireland portugal and spain

     significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar
reduction in our prices as a consequence of our policy of matching our
competitors lowest advertised prices any of these competitive pressures may
materially adversely affect operating results

markets served

     demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging us
population is increasingly using healthcare services between 1995 and 2000 the
45to65 age group grew by 50 and this group is expected to double by 2020 in
the dental industry there is predicted to be an attendant rise in oral
healthcare expenditures as this segment of the population increases cosmetic
dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies
allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients seek at the same time
there is an increase in dental insurance coverage just over 56 of the us
population now has some form of dental coverage up from 44 in 1994

     we support dental professionals through the 60000 skus we offer as well
as through important valueadded services including practice management
software electronic claims processing financial services and continuing
education all designed to help maximize a practitioners efficiency and
profitability

     we believe our medical group is the fastest growing distributor among the
major competitors in the physician and alternate care markets there continues
to be a migration of procedures from acutecare settings to physicians offices

item 3 legal proceedings

     our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims
in the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as a
defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other
healthcare products as of december 28 2002 we were named a defendant in
approximately 57 product liability cases of these claims 47 involve claims
made by healthcare workers who claim allergic reaction relating to exposure to
latex gloves in each of these cases we acted as a distributor of both brand
name and henry schein private brand latex gloves which were manufactured by
third parties to date discovery in these cases has generally been limited to
product identification issues the manufacturers in these cases have withheld
indemnification of the company pending product identification however we have
impleaded or filed cross claims against those manufacturers subject to
jurisdiction in each case in which we are a defendant

     on january 27 1998 in district court in travis county texas we and one
of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a matter entitled shelly e
stromboe and jeanne taylor on behalf of

                                       13

themselves and all others similarly situated vs henry schein inc easy dental
systems inc and dentisoft inc case no 9800886 the petition alleges
among other things negligence breach of contract fraud and violations of
certain texas commercial statutes involving the sale of certain practice
management software products sold prior to 1998 under the easy dentalr name
in october 1999 the trial court on motion certified both a windowsr
subclass and a dos subclass to proceed as a class action pursuant to tex r
civ p 42 it is estimated that 5000 windowsr customers and 10000 dos
customers were covered by the class action that was certified by the trial
court in november of 1999 we filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial
courts determination to the texas court of appeals on the issue of whether this
case was properly certified as a class action on september 14 2000 the court
of appeals affirmed the trial courts certification order on january 5 2001
we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court asking the court to
find that it had conflicts jurisdiction to permit review of the trial courts
certification order the texas supreme court heard oral argument on february 6
2002 on october 31 2002 the texas supreme court issued an opinion in the case
holding that it had conflicts jurisdiction to review the decision of the court
of appeals and finding that the trial courts certification of the case as a
class action was improper the supreme court further held that the judgment of
the court of appeals which affirmed the class certification order must be
reversed in its entirety upon reversal of the class certification order the
supreme court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings
consistent with its opinion on january 31 2003 counsel for the class filed a
motion for rehearing with the texas supreme court seeking a reversal for the
supreme courts earlier opinion reversing the class certification order the
motion for rehearing has not yet been ruled upon and remains pending before the
texas supreme court because the texas supreme court has not yet ruled upon the
motion for rehearing and because this matter has not yet come before the trial
court for consideration consistent with the texas supreme courts opinion
reversing the trial courts certification order it is not possible to determine
what the trial court will do if the plaintiffs file another motion for class
certification further because of the decertification of the class by the texas
supreme court the pending motion for rehearing before the texas supreme court
and other factors it is not possible to determine whether the trial court will
certify a different class upon motion if any or the possible range of damages
or other relief sought by the plaintiffs in the trial court

     in february 2002 we were served with a summons and complaint in an action
commenced in the superior court of new jersey law division morris county
entitled west morris pediatrics pa vs henry schein inc doing business as
caligor case no mrsl42102 the complaint by west morris pediatrics purports
to be on behalf of a nationwide class but there has been no court determination
that the case may proceed as a class action plaintiff seeks to represent a
class of all physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers throughout new
jersey and across the united states this complaint as amended in august 2002
alleges among other things breach of oral contract breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act
unjust enrichment conversion and promissory estoppel relating to sales of a
vaccine product in the year 2001 we filed an answer in october 2002 because
damages have not been specified by the plaintiffs it is not possible to
determine the range of damages or other relief sought by the plaintiffs we
intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this claim as well as all other
claims suits and complaints

     we have various insurance policies including product liability insurance
covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate in many cases in which we
have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others we are
provided indemnification by the manufacturer there can be no assurance that the
coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or
at a reasonable cost or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate
protection for the company in the opinion of the company all pending matters

critical accounting policies and estimates

     securities exchange commission financial reporting release no 60 requires
all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods
used in the preparation of financial statements

     we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial
statements

managements estimates

     the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities
revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate estimates including those related
to sales allowance provisions as described below volume purchase rebates
income taxes inventory and bad debts reserves and contingencies we base our
estimates on historical data when available
                                       19
page

experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results
may differ from these estimates

revenue recognition

     sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to
customers as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations the
product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable
is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable revenues derived from
post contract customer support for practice management software are deferred and
recognized ratably over the period in which the support is to be provided
generally one year revenues from freight charged to customers are recognized
when products are shipped provisions for discounts rebates to customers
customer returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the
related sales are recorded based upon historical data

accounts receivable and credit policies

     the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation
allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be
collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider
many factors in estimating our general allowance including historical data
experience customer types credit worthiness and economic trends from time to
time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of those or
other factors expected to affect collectability

     allowances for accounts receivable comprised primarily of the allowance
for doubtful accounts and the allowance for sales returns were 362 million
and 319 million at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 respectively

longlived assets

     longlived assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows from the use of these assets when any such impairment exists the related
assets are written down to fair value

     other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we
have reassessed the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets which
primarily consist of noncompete agreements and no changes were deemed
necessary

goodwill

     at december 28 2002 we had recorded approximately 3103 million in
goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization primarily
related to acquisitions made in 2002 and prior years in june 2001 the
financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting
standards no 141 business combinations fas 141 and no 142 goodwill
and other intangible assets fas 142 effective for fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 under the new standards goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to
annual impairment tests in accordance with fas 142 we estimated the fair value
of our reporting units in accordance with the new standard and compared these
valuations with the respective book values for each of the reporting units to
determine whether any goodwill impairment existed the goodwill is substantially
related to our healthcare distribution segment in determining the fair value
we consider past present and future expectations of performance as required by
fas 142 we will complete subsequent goodwill impairment tests at least
annually during the fourth quarter of 2002

                                       20
page

we completed the annual test using a methodology similar to the transitional
test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the first day
of the fourth quarter changes in market conditions among other factors could
have a material impact on these estimates

stockbased compensation

     we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic
valuebased method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board
opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees under this method no
compensation expense is recorded so long as the quoted market price of the stock
at the date of grant is equal to the exercise price we make pro forma
disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair valuebased
method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stockbased
compensation had been applied as required by statement of financial accounting
standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation fas 123 had
we elected to use fas 123 to account for stockbased compensation under the fair
value method we would have been required to record compensation expense and as
a result diluted earnings per common share for the fiscal years ended december
2002 2001 and 2000 would have been lower by 021 016 and 019
respectively

plan of restructuring

     on august 1 2000 we announced a comprehensive restructuring plan designed
to improve customer service and increase profitability by maximizing the
efficiency of our infrastructure in addition to closing or downsizing certain
facilities this worldwide initiative included the elimination of approximately
300 positions including open positions or approximately 5 of the total
workforce throughout all levels within the organization the restructuring plan
was substantially completed at december 30 2000

     for the years ended december 28 2002 and december 30 2000 we incurred
onetime restructuring costs of approximately 04 million 04 million after
taxes and 144 million 93 million after taxes or approximately 001 and
022 per diluted share respectively consisting primarily of employee
severance costs including severance pay and benefits of approximately 01
million and 72 million respectively facility closing costs primarily lease
termination and asset writeoff costs of approximately 03 million and 44
million respectively and outside professional and consulting fees directly
related to the restructuring plan of approximately 00 million and 28
million respectively

acquisition strategy

     our results of operations in recent years have been significantly impacted
by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business both
domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the
healthcare industry including potential healthcare reform trends toward
managed care cuts in medicare consolidation of healthcare distribution
companies and collective purchasing arrangements

     in connection with certain acquisitions completed during the year ended
december 30 2000 we incurred certain merger and integration costs of
approximately 06 million net of taxes merger and integration costs were
approximately 001 per share on a diluted basis merger and integration costs
for the healthcare distribution and technology segments were 00 million and
06 million for 2000 merger and integration costs consist primarily of
investment banking legal accounting and advisory fees severance and
impairment of goodwill arising from acquired businesses integrated into our
medical and dental businesses as well as certain other integration costs
associated with these mergers during 2002 we revised our original estimates of
our merger and integration costs from prior years the change in estimates was
attributable to facts and circumstances that arose subsequent to the original
charges as a result in the fourth quarter of 2002 we reversed 12 million of
our previously recorded expenses net of taxes merger and integration credits
were approximately 003 per share on a diluted basis

2002 compared to 2001

     for the year ended december 28 2002 our net sales increased 2668
million or 104 to 28250 million in 2002 from 25582 million in 2001
of the 2668 million increase approximately 2563 million or 961
represented a 102 increase in our healthcare distribution business as part of
this increase approximately 1114 million represented an 113 increase in our
medical business 1059 million represented a 94 increase in our dental
business and 390 million represented a 98 increase in our international
business the increase in medical net sales was primarily attributable to
increased sales to core physicians offices and alternate care markets in the
dental market the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased dental
equipment sales and services and increased penetration to existing customers
primarily driven by our privileges loyalty program net sales of dental
consumable merchandise increased by 73 while net sales of dental equipment
increased by 185 in the international market the increase in net sales was
primarily due to increased account penetration in france the united kingdom
and australia and by favorable exchange rates to the us dollar had net sales
for the international market been translated at the same exchange rates in 2001
net sales would have increased by 47 the remaining increase in 2002 net sales
was due to the technology business which increased 105 million or 187 to
667 million for 2002 from 562 million for 2001 the increase in technology
and valueadded product net sales was primarily due to increased sales of
software products and related services as part of a new marketing initiative
marketone certain technology and equipment products were sold directly to
enduser customers beginning with the third quarter of 2002 rather than through
resellers which resulted in a higher growth rate for the technology business
without this change the technology business net sales would have increased

administrative expenses decreased 04 to 81 in 2002 from 85 in 2001 the
decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the
elimination of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with fas 142

     other income expense  net decreased by 08 million to 66 million
in 2002 from 74 million for 2001 due primarily to the favorable settlement
of a real estate transaction

administrative expenses decreased 03 to 85 in 2001 from 88 in 2000 the
decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reductions
in expenses associated with our restructuring program

     other income expense  net decreased by 87 million to 74 million
in 2001 from 161 million for 2000 due primarily to higher interest income
on longterm loans receivable and shortterm investments higher finance charge

longterm debt and bank credit line balances and lower interest rates and in
2000 the nonrecurring loss of 16 million after tax on the sale of our
software development unit in the united kingdom

     equity in earnings losses of affiliates increased 23 million to 04

seasonality

     our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences net
sales and operating profits are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to
timing of sales of software and equipment year end promotions and purchasing
patterns of officebased healthcare practitioners and are generally lower in the
first quarter due primarily to the increased purchases in the prior quarter
quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other factors
including the timing of acquisitions and related costs timing of purchases
andor sales special promotional campaigns seasonal products fluctuations in
exchange rates associated with international operations and adverse weather
conditions

ecommerce

     traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being
impacted by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is
characterized by rapid technological developments and is highly competitive the
rapid evolution of online commerce will require us to provide continuous
improvement in performance features and reliability of internet content and
technology particularly in response to competitive offerings through our
proprietary technologicallybased suite of products we offer customers a
variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable
service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base built on solid
customer relationships makes us well situated to participate in this growing
aspect of the distribution business we are exploring ways and means of
improving and expanding our internet presence and will continue to do so

inflation

     management does not believe inflation had a material effect on the
financial statements for the periods presented

effect of recently issued accounting standards

     in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statements of financial accounting standards no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities fas 146 this statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue
no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and
other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a
restructuring eitf 943 the principal difference between this statement
and eitf 943 relates to the statements requirements for recognition of a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity this
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf 943
a liability was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit
plan this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after december 31 2002 we do not expect the adoption of fas 146 to
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

     in september 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue 0021 accounting
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 0021 eitf 0021
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which it will perform multiple revenuegenerating activities those arrangements
could involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or
rights to use assets and the performance could occur at different points in
time or over different periods of time the issue addresses when and if so how
a company should divide an arrangement involving multiple deliverables into
separate units of accounting eitf 0021 is effective for revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2002 we do not expect
the adoption of eitf 0021 to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations

     on december 31 2002 the fasb amended the transition and disclosure
requirements of fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased
compensation fas 123 through the issuance of fasb statement no 148
accounting for stockbased compensationtransition and disclosure fas
148 fas 148 amends the existing disclosures that a company should make in its
annual financial statements and requires for the first time disclosures in
interim financial reports those disclosures are required regardless of the
method being used to account for stockbased employee compensation the amended
and new disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ending
december 27 2003 the adoption of the disclosure requirements of fas 148 will
not have a material effect on our financial statements as permitted under fas
123 we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock
issued to employees apb 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
our employee stock options under apb 25 because the exercise price of our
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant no compensation expense is recognized

     in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 guarantors
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect
guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 fin 45 addresses the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under guarantees the disclosure requirements
in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or
annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we do not expect this
interpretation to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements

     in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation
of variable interest entities fin 46 fin 46 clarifies the application of
accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements to
certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties fin 46 is applicable immediately for variable
interest entities created after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities
created prior to january 31 2003 the provisions of fin 46 are applicable no
later than july 1 2003 we do not expect this interpretation to have an effect
on our consolidated financial statements

risk management

     we have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the
netherlands belgium germany france austria spain ireland portugal
australia and new zealand we endeavor to protect substantially all of our
operations financial results by using foreign currency forward contracts to
hedge intercompany debt and the foreign currency payments to foreign vendors
the total us dollar equivalent of all foreign currency forward contracts
hedging intercompany debt and the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors
was 736 million and 44 million respectively as of the end of fiscal 2002
as of december 28 2002 the fair value of these contracts which expire through
january 2004 is determined by quoted market prices and was not material for
the year ended december 28 2002 we recognized an immaterial loss relating to
our foreign currency forward contracts

     we consider our investment in foreign operations to be both longterm and
strategic as a result we do not hedge the longterm translation exposure to
our balance sheet we have experienced positive and negative translation
adjustments of approximately 190 million and 57 million in 2002 and 2001
respectively which were reflected in the balance sheet as a component of
stockholders equity the cumulative translation adjustment at the end of 2002
showed a net negative translation adjustment of 48 million

liquidity and capital resources

     our principal capital requirements have been to fund a capital
expenditures b acquisitions and c working capital needs resulting from
increased sales and special inventory forward buyin opportunities since sales
tend to be strongest during the fourth quarter and special inventory forward
buyin opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our
working capital requirements have been generally higher from the end of the
third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year we have
financed our business primarily through our operations our revolving credit
facilities private placement loans and stock issuances

     net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 28
2002 of 1347 million resulted primarily from net income of 1180 million and
noncash charges of approximately 362 million offset by a net increase in
operating items of working capital of approximately 195 million the increase
in working capital items was primarily due to an increase in inventories of
231 million a 184 million increase in other current assets and a 20
million increase in accounts receivable offset by a 240 million increase in
accounts payable and accruals our accounts receivable days sales outstanding
ratio improved to 482 days for the period ending december 28 2002 from 535
days for the period ending december 29 2001 primarily due to greater focus in
this area our inventory turns were 66 inventory turns for the period ending
december 28 2002 compared to 69 inventory turns for the period ending december
29 2001 primarily due to an increase in forward buyins and inventory stocking
for warehouses opened in 2002 we anticipate future increases in working capital
requirements as a result of our continued sales growth extended payment terms
and special inventory forward buyin opportunities

     net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 28 2002
of 1428 million resulted primarily from cash used for the purchases of united
states government and government agency bonds municipal bonds and corporate
bonds rated aaa by moodys or an equivalent rating and commercial paper rated
p1 by moodys or an equivalent rating with maturities of more than three
months for which fair values are determined by quoted market prices of 552
million capital expenditures of 475 million of which approximately 116
million was for the purchase of a building used for our corporate headquarters
and business acquisitions of 362 million of which 274 million represented
contingent earnout payments associated with acquisitions made in prior years
during the past three years we have invested 1234 million in the development
of new computer systems and for new and existing operating facilities in the
coming year we expect to invest in excess of 350 million in capital projects
to modernize and expand our facilities and infrastructure computer systems and
integrate operations

     net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 28
2002 of 187 million resulted primarily from proceeds from the issuance of
stock upon exercise of stock options of 341 million offset primarily by net
payments on longterm debt of 149 million

     certain holders of minority interests in entities we have acquired have the
right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that
approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price based on earnings of the
entity

     our cash and cash equivalents as of december 28 2002 of 2007 million
consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds these
investments have staggered maturity dates none of which exceed three months
and have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are actively traded in
public markets

     on may 2 2002 we renewed and increased our revolving credit facility to
2000 million from 1500 million the new facility is a four year committed
line scheduled to terminate on may 2 2006 there were no borrowings under the
credit facility at december 28 2002 we also have one uncommitted bank line of
150 million of which no amounts have been borrowed against at december 28

     on march 12 2003 we announced that our board of directors had authorized
the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock which
represented approximately 45 of shares outstanding on the announcement date
we expect purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through
negotiated transactions

     we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of 2007 million and our
investment in shortterm marketable securities of 312 million as of december
28 2002 our ability to access public and private debt and equity markets and
the availability of funds under our existing credit agreements will provide us
with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable shortterm and
longterm capital needs




item 7a  market risks

     we are exposed to market risks which include changes in us and
international interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates as measured against the us dollar and each other we attempt to reduce
these risks by utilizing financial instruments that are consistent with our
internal policies

forward foreign currency contracts

     the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may
affect our financial results changes in exchange rates may positively or
negatively affect our revenues as expressed in us dollars gross margins
operating expenses and retained earnings where we deem it prudent we engage
in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency
fluctuations using primarily forward exchange contracts we hedge those
transactions that when remeasured according to accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states may impact our statement of income from time to
time we purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts to protect against
currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans of a longterm
investment nature due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of
merchandise purchases to foreign vendors as of december 28 2002 we had
outstanding foreign currency forward contracts aggregating 780 million of
which 736 million

                                       28
page

related to intercompany debt and 44 million related to the purchase of
merchandise from foreign vendors the contracts hedge against currency
fluctuations of british pounds 381 million euros 349 million
australian dollars 39 million swiss francs 08 million japanese yen
02 million and new zealand dollars 01 million as of december 28 2002
the fair value of these contracts which are determined by quoted market prices
and expire through january 2004 was not material for the year ended december
28 2002 we recognized an immaterial loss relating to our foreign currency
forward contracts

     these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency
exchange risks factors that could impact the effectiveness of our programs
include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging
instruments all currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging
programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or
anticipated currency exposure not for speculation although we maintain these
programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates when the
us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we
sell products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in
which we incur costs our revenues or costs are adversely affected

interest rates

     we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates from borrowings under
certain variable bank credit lines and loan agreements we have fixed rate debt
of 1300 million at 694 and 1000 million at 666 if the remaining
outstanding debt at december 28 2002 of 200 million was the average balance
for the following twelve month period and we experienced a 1 increase in
average interest rates the interest expense for that period would have
increased by 02 million based upon current economic conditions we do not
believe interest rates will increase substantially in the near future as a
result we do not believe that it is currently necessary to hedge our exposure
against potential future interest rate increases

risk factors

     stockholders and investors should carefully consider the risks described
below and other information in this annual report our business financial
condition and operating results and the trading price of our common stock could
be adversely affected if any of these risks materialize

         the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive
          and we compete with numerous companies including major manufacturers
          and distributors that have greater financial and other resources than
          us competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular
          products or manufacturers could increase their efforts to sell
          directly to endusers thereby bypassing distributors like us
          consolidation among healthcare products distributors could result in
          existing competitors increasing their market position in addition
          unavailability of products whether due to our inability to gain
          access to products or interruptions in supply of products from
          manufacturers could adversely affect our operating results

         in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant
          change driven by various efforts to reduce costs including the
          reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance
          programs such as medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance
          plans trends toward managed care consolidation of healthcare
          distribution companies electronic commerce and collective purchasing
          arrangements among officebased healthcare practitioners if we are
          unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the
          healthcare industry our operating results could be adversely
          affected

         our technology segment which primarily sells practice management
          software and other valueadded products depends upon continued
          product development technical support and marketing failures in
          these and related areas could adversely affect our results of
          operations

         our business is subject to requirements under various local state
          federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to
          the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical
          devices including the federal food drug and cosmetic act the
          prescription drug marketing act of 1987 and the controlled substances
          act there is no assurance that current or future government
          regulations will not adversely affect our business

         our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in
          the ordinary course of business and from time to time we are named as
          a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical
          and other healthcare products we have insurance policies including
          product liability insurance and in many cases we have indemnification
          rights from manufacturers with respect to the products we distribute
          there is no assurance that insurance coverage or manufacturers
          indemnity will be available in all of the pending or any future cases
          brought against us or that an unfavorable result in any such case
          will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of
          operations

         our business is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain
          qualified sales representatives service specialists and other sales
          agents due to the relationships developed between our field sales
          representatives and their customers upon the departure of a sales
          representative we face the risk of losing the representatives
          customers especially if the representative becomes an employee of one
          of our competitors

         our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly
          fluctuations net sales and operating profits generally have been
          higher in the fourth quarter due to purchasing patterns of
          officebased healthcare practitioners and year end promotions net
          sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first
          quarter primarily due to increased purchases in the prior quarter

         our international operations are subject to inherent risks which
          could adversely affect our operating results these risks include
          difficulties in opening and managing foreign offices and distribution
          centers difficulties in establishing channels of distribution
          fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies longer payment cycles
          of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in
          foreign jurisdictions importexport duties and quotas and unexpected
          regulatory economic and political changes in foreign markets

         our expansion through acquisitions andor joint ventures could result
          in a loss of customers diversion of management attention and
          increased demands on our operations information systems and financial
          resources

         we rely on third parties to ship products to our customers increases
          in shipping rates or interruptions of service could adversely affect
          our operating results

         changes in ecommerce could affect our business relationships and
          could require significant resources the evolution of online
          commerce including businesstobusiness exchanges will require us to
          continuously improve the performance security features and
          reliability of internet content and technology

acquisition strategy

     the company  believes that there has been  consolidation  among  healthcare
product distributors serving  officebased  healthcare  practitioners in part to
address  significant  changes in the healthcare  industry  including  potential
healthcare reform  trends toward managed care cuts in medicare  consolidation
of healthcare  distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements and
that this trend will continue to create  opportunities for the company to expand
through  acquisitions  in recent  years  the company has  acquired a number of
companies  engaged in businesses that are complementary to those of the company
the companys acquisition strategy includes acquiring additional sales that will
be channeled through the companys existing infrastructure  acquiring access to
additional product lines acquiring regional distributors with networks of field
sales consultants and international expansion

     the company believes that its healthcare  distribution  customers generally

customers  generally  place larger orders and order more  frequently  from their
primary suppliers the company estimates that it serves as a primary supplier to
less than 15 of its total  customer base and believes it has an  opportunity to
increase  sales by  increasing  its level of business  with those  customers for
which it serves as a secondary supplier

include larger purchasing organizations  including certain dental laboratories
institutions government agencies hospitals and surgery centers more recently

products and valueadded  services  the company has targeted specific groups of
practices  under  common  ownership  institutions and professional groups  for

item 7a  market risks

     the company is exposed to market risks  which include  changes in us and
international  interest  rates as well as changes in foreign  currency  exchange
rates as measured  against the us dollar and each other  the company attempts
to reduce these risks by utilizing  financial  instruments  pursuant to company
policies

forward foreign currency contracts

     the value of certain foreign  currencies as compared to the us dollar may
affect the companys financial results changes in exchange rates may positively
or  negatively  affect the companys  revenues as  expressed in us  dollars
gross margins  operating  expenses  and retained  earnings  where the company
deems it prudent it engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the
impact of currency fluctuations using primarily forward exchange contracts the
company hedges those transactions that when remeasured  according to accounting
principles  generally accepted in the united states may impact its statement of
income  from time to time the company  purchases  shortterm  forward exchange
contracts  to  protect  against  currency  exchange  risks  associated  with the
ultimate  repayment of intercompany  loans due from the companys  international
subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise  purchases to foreign vendors as of
december  29  2001  the  company  had  outstanding  foreign  currency  forward
contracts   aggregating  467  million  of  which  441  million  related  to
intercompany  debt and 26 million related to the purchase of merchandise  from
foreign vendors  the contracts hedge against  currency  fluctuations of british
pounds 241 million euros 211 million australian dollars 13 million
and new zealand dollars 02  million  as of december 29 2001 the fair value
of these  contracts  which are  determined  by quoted  market prices and expire
through  november 2002 was not material  for the year ended december 29 2001
the company  recognized  an  immaterial  loss  relating to its foreign  currency
forward contracts

     these hedging  activities  provide only limited protection against currency
exchange  risks  factors that could impact the  effectiveness  of the companys
programs include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging
instruments  all  currency  contracts  that are entered into by the company are
components  of hedging  programs  and are entered  into for the sole  purpose of
hedging an existing  or  anticipated  currency  exposure  not for  speculation
although the company maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in
currency exchange rates when the u s dollar sustains a strengthening position
against  currencies  in which the company  sells  products  and  services  or a
weakening  exchange rate against  currencies in which the company  incurs costs
the companys revenues or costs are adversely affected

interest rates

     the  company  is  exposed  to risk from  changes  in  interest  rates  from
borrowings  under certain  variable bank credit lines and loan  agreements  the
company  has fixed rate debt of 1300  million  at 694 and 1000  million at
666 if the remaining  outstanding  debt at december 29 2001 of 314 million
was the average  balance for the  following  twelve month period and the company
experienced a 1 increase in average  interest rates  the interest  expense for
that period would have  increased by 03 million  based upon current  economic
conditions   the  company  does  not  believe   interest  rates  will  increase
substantially in the near future  as a result  the company does not believe it
is  necessary to hedge its  exposure  against  potential  future  interest  rate
increases

competition

         the distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment
is intensely competitive many of the healthcare distribution products the
company sells are available to the companys customers from a number of
suppliers in addition competitors of the company could obtain exclusive rights
from manufacturers to market particular products manufacturers could also seek
to sell directly to endusers and thereby eliminate the role of distributors
such as the company significant price reductions by the companys competitors
could result in a similar reduction in the companys prices as a consequence of
its policy of matching its competitors lowest advertised prices any of these
competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results

         in the united states the company competes with other distributors as
well as several major manufacturers of dental medical and veterinary products
primarily on the basis of price breadth of product line customer service and
valueadded services and products in the sale of its dental products

item 7a  market risks

     the company is exposed to market risks which include changes in us and
international interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates as measured against the us dollar and each other the company attempts
to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments pursuant to company
policies

forward foreign currency contracts

     the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may
affect the companys financial results changes in exchange rates may positively
or negatively affect the companys revenues as expressed in us dollars
gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings where the company
deems it prudent it engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the
impact of currency fluctuations using primarily forward exchange contracts the
company hedges those transactions that when remeasured according to accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states may impact its statement of
operations from time to time the company purchases shortterm forward exchange
contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the
ultimate repayment of intercompany loans due from the companys international
subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors as of
december 30 2000 the company had outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts aggregating 580 million of which 512 million related to
intercompany debt and 68 million related to the purchase of merchandise from
foreign vendors the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of australian
dollars 04 million canadian dollars 139 million deutsche mark 119
million euro 01 million french francs 92 million british pounds
142 million netherland guilders 25 million swiss francs 07
million belgium francs 20 million and spanish pesetas 31 million at
december 30 2000 the company had net deferred losses from foreign currency
forward contracts of approximately 04 million the contracts expire at various
dates through 2001

     these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency
exchange risks factors that could impact the effectiveness of the companys
programs include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging
instruments all currency contracts that are entered into by the company are
components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of
hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure not for speculation
although the company maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in
currency exchange rates when the u s dollar sustains a strengthening position
against currencies in which the company sells products and services or a
weakening exchange rate against currencies in which the company incurs costs
the companys revenues or costs are adversely affected

interest rate swaps and cap

     as of december 30 2000 the company had approximately 178 million
outstanding in interest rate swaps these swaps are used to convert 130
million of floating rate debt relating to the companys revolving credit
agreement and 48 million relating to a deutsche mark floating rate debt of
dm100 million to fixed rate debt to reduce the companys exposure to interest
rate fluctuations the net result was to substitute a weighted average fixed
interest rate of 72 for the variable libor rate on 130 million and 53
fixed interest rate for the variable euribor for the deutsche mark loan of the
companys debt the swaps expire in december 2003 december 2004 and april 2005
under the interest rate environment during the year ended december 30 2000 the
companys interest rate swap agreements resulted in additional expense of
approximately 01 million

in addition the company has an interest rate cap of 55 on a deutsche mark
floating rate debt of dm 63 million approximately 30 million

     the company is exposed to risk from changes in interest rates from
borrowings under certain variable bank credit lines and loan agreements if the
outstanding balance at december 30 2000 of 467 million was the average
balance for the following twelve month period and the company experienced a 1
increase in average interest rates the interest expense for that period would
have increased by 05 million based upon current economic conditions the
company does not believe interest rates will increase substantially in the near
future as a result the company does not believe it is necessary to hedge its
exposure against potential future interest rate increases
