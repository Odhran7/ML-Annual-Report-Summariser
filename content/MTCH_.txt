the business of creating meaningful connections 

our goal is to spark meaningful connections for users around the world consumers’ preferences vary significantly influenced in part by demographics geography cultural norms religion and intent for example seeking friendship casual dating or more serious relationships as a result the market for connecting with others through relationship technologies is fragmented and no single service has been able to effectively serve the relationship technology category 

prior to the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices human connections traditionally were limited by social circles geography and time people met through work colleagues friends and family in school at church at social gatherings in bars and restaurants or in other social settings today the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can create new interactions and develop meaningful connections and relationships additionally the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas across the world that previously served as barriers to individuals using technology to help find and develop those connections 

we believe that technologies that bring people together serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for users including 

• expanded options  relationship technologies provide users access to a large pool of people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet 

• efficiency  the search and recommending features as well as the profile information available on relationship technologies allow users to filter a large number of individuals in a short period of time increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone 

• more comfort and control  compared to the traditional ways that people meet relationship technologies provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around identifying and reaching out to new people who are interested in connecting this leads to many people who would otherwise be passive participants taking a more active role 

• safely meet new people relationship technologies can offer a safer way to contact new people for the firsttime by limiting the amount of personal information exchanged and providing an opportunity to vet a new connection before meeting in person including via video communication 

• convenience  the nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time regardless of where they are 

depending on a person’s circumstances at any given time relationship technologies can act as a supplement to or substitute for traditional means of meeting people when selecting a relationship technology service we believe that users consider the following attributes 

• brand recognition and scale  brand is very important users generally associate strong brands with a higher likelihood of success and more tools to help the user connect safely and securely generally successful brands depend on large active communities of users strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users 

• successful experiences  demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through wordofmouth recommendations successful experiences also drive repeat usage 

• community identification  users typically look for relationship technologies that offer a community or communities to which the user can relate by selecting a relationship technology service that is focused on a particular demographic religion geography or intent users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify 

• service features and user experience  users tend to gravitate towards relationship technologies that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them such as questionbased matching algorithms locationbased features or search capabilities user experience is also driven by the type of user interface for example using our patented swipe ® technology versus scrolling a particular mix of free and paid features ease of use privacy and security users expect every interaction with a relationship technology service to be seamless and intuitive 

given varying consumer preferences we have adopted a brand portfolio approach through which we attempt to offer relationship technologies that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers we believe that this approach maximizes our ability to attract additional users 

our portfolio 

making connections with other people online is a highly personal endeavor and consumers have a wide variety of preferences that determine what type of technologies they choose to make those connections as a result our strategy focuses on a portfolio approach of various brands in order to reach a broad range of users many of our brands have a long legacy while others emerged during the time when mobile devices proliferated the following is a list of our key brands

we strive to empower individual brand leaders with the authority and incentives to grow their respective brands our brands compete with each other and with thirdparty businesses on brand characteristics service features and business model 

we also work to apply a centralized discipline to our portfolio of brands and share best practices across our brands in order to quickly introduce new services and features optimize marketing increase growth reduce costs improve user safety and maximize profitability additionally we centralize certain other administrative 

functions such as legal accounting finance and tax we attempt to centrally facilitate excellence and efficiency across the entire portfolio by 

• centralizing operational functions across certain brands where we have strength in personnel and sufficient commonality of business interest for example ad sales online marketing and information technology are centralized across some but not all brands 

• developing talent across the portfolio to allow for development of specific proficiencies and promoting career advancement while maintaining the ability to deploy the best talent in the most critical positions across the company at any given time and 

• sharing analytics to leverage services and marketing successes across our businesses rapidly for competitive advantage 

staying competitive 

the industry for relationship technologies is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar technologies for people to meet each other including other online dating platforms social media platforms socialdiscovery apps offline dating services such as inperson matchmakers and other traditional means of meeting people 

we believe that our ability to attract new users to our brands will depend primarily upon the following factors 

• our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of technologies to meet other people particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the associated stigma has not yet fully eroded 

• continued growth in internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world particularly emerging markets 

• the continued strength of our established brands and the growth of our emerging brands 

• the breadth and depth of our active communities of users 

• our brands’ reputation for trust and safety 

• our ability to evolve our services to keep up with user requirements social trends and the everevolving technological landscape 

• our brands’ ability to keep up with the constantly changing regulatory landscape in particular as it relates to the regulation of consumer digital media platforms 

• our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our services 

• our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies and 

• the design and functionality of our services 

a large portion of customers use multiple services over a given period of time either concurrently or sequentially making our broad portfolio of brands a competitive advantage 

where we earn our revenue 

all our brands enable users to establish a profile and review other users’ profiles without charge each brand also offers additional features some of which are free and some of which require payment depending on the particular service in general access to premium features requires a subscription which is typically offered in packages generally ranging from one to six months depending on the service and circumstance prices can differ meaningfully within a given brand depending on the duration of a subscription the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a user is taking advantage of any special offers in addition to subscriptions many of our brands offer users certain features such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or highlight themselves to a specific user and these features are offered on a payperuse or à la carte basis the precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brandbybrand basis and is subject to constant iteration and evolution 

our direct revenue is primarily derived from users in the form of recurring subscriptions which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specified period of time and to a lesser extent from à la carte features where users pay a nonrecurring fee for a specific consumable benefit or feature each of our brands offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its unique community in addition to direct revenue from our users we generate indirect revenue from advertising which comprises a much smaller percentage of our overall revenue as compared to direct revenue 

dependencies on services provided by others 

app stores 

we fully rely on the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications and related inapp services while our mobile applications are free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features through these applications we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold however currently purchases of these subscriptions and features are required in most cases to be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and google due to these requirements we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 although as of january 1 2022 google has reduced the percentage applicable to subscriptions to 15 of the revenue we receive from these transactions 

additionally when our users and subscribers access and pay through the app stores apple and google may receive personal data about our users and subscribers that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly apple and google have restricted our access to much of that data 

both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our applications including the amount of and requirement to pay certain fees associated with purchases required to be facilitated by apple and google through their payment systems and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our applications through their stores the features we provide the manner in which we market our inapp services and our ability to access information about our users and subscribers that they collect apple or google could also make changes to their operating systems or payment services that could negatively impact our business including by unilaterally raising the prices for those services 

the manner in which apple and google operate these services is being reviewed by legislative and regulatory bodies globally notably the republic of korea recently adopted legislation that prohibits apple and google from requiring that developers exclusively use apple and google to process payments in the netherlands the authority for consumers and markets found apple’s requirement that online dating companies must exclusively use apple’s inapp payment violates both dutch and european union law multiple other jurisdictions including the european union united kingdom russia japan and india are investigating considering regulatory action or considering legislation to restrict or prohibit these practices the united states congress as well as a number of state legislatures are also considering legislation that would regulate certain terms of the relationships between developers and apple and google and prohibit apple and google from requiring inapp payment processing 

cloud and other services 

we rely on third parties primarily datacenter service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services as well as third party computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our applications generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

problems experienced by thirdparty data center service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services upon which brands including tinder pairs and hinge rely the telecommunications network providers with which we or they contract or with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers could also adversely affect us any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers such as amazon web services or any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the 

performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our services or process transactions with our users which would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

sales and marketing 

all of our brands rely on wordofmouth or free user acquisition to varying degrees our brands also rely on paid user acquisition for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns video advertising business development or partnership arrangements creating content and partnering with influencers among other means to promote our services our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising outofhome advertising and public relations efforts 

intellectual property 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success 

for example we rely heavily upon the use of trademarks primarily tinder ®  match ®  plentyoffish ®  okcupid ®  meetic ®  ourtime ®  pairs™ hinge ®  swipe ®  azar ®  and hakuna™ and associated domain names taglines and logos to market our services and applications and build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition we maintain an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names service names taglines and logos and renew existing trademark and service mark registrations in the united states and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine it to be necessary or otherwise appropriate and costeffective in addition we have a trademark and service mark monitoring policy pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours as well as potential unauthorized use of our material trademarks and service marks our enforcement of this policy affords us valuable protection under current laws rules and regulations we also reserve and register to the extent available and renew existing registrations for domain names that we believe are material to our business 

we also rely upon a combination of inlicensed thirdparty and proprietary trade secrets including proprietary algorithms and upon patented and patentpending technologies processes and features relating to our recommendation process systems or features and services with expiration dates from 2023 to 2040 we have an ongoing invention recognition program pursuant to which we apply for patents to the extent we determine it to be core to our service or businesses or otherwise appropriate and costeffective 

we rely on a combination of internal and external controls including applicable laws rules and regulations and contractual restrictions with employees contractors customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish protect and otherwise control access to our various intellectual property rights 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business including among others broadband internet access online commerce advertising user privacy data protection intermediary liability protection of minors consumer protection general safety sextrafficking taxation money laundering and securities law compliance as a result we could be subject to actions based on negligence regulatory compliance various torts and trademark and copyright infringement among other actions see “risk factors—risks relating to our business—our business is subject to complex and evolving us and international laws and regulations including with respect to data privacy and platform liability these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in changes to our business practices increased cost of operations declines in user growth or engagement claims monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business” and “—risks relating to our business—we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties” 

because we receive store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users we are particularly impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy the storage sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches in many of the countries in which we operate for example in 2016 the european commission adopted the general data protection act which we 

refer to as “gdpr” a comprehensive eu privacy and data protection reform that became effective in may 2018 the act applies to companies established in the eu or otherwise providing services or monitoring the behavior of people located in the eu and provides for significant penalties in case of noncompliance as well as a private right of action for individual claimants gdpr will continue to be interpreted by eu data protection regulators which have and may in the future require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional costs risks and liabilities the eu is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communications socalled “eprivacy” directive notably to amend rules on the use of cookies direct marketing and processing of private communications and related metadata which may also require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional costs risks and liabilities in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu declared transfers of personal data on the basis of the european commission’s privacy shield decision illegal and stipulated stricter requirements for the transfer of personal data based on standard contract clauses this judgement and the resulting decisions and guidelines from eu supervisory authorities may require changes to our business practices and generate additional costs risks and liabilities brexit could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the united kingdom at the same time many countries in which we do business have already adopted or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information have been introduced in the us congress various us state legislatures including those in new york illinois california and many other states are considering privacy legislation in 2022 and beyond other us state legislatures have already passed and enacted privacy legislation most prominently the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which was signed into law in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1 2020 with full enforcement commencing on june 30 2020 on november 3 2020 the “california privacy rights act of 2020” cpra was enacted which expands the state’s consumer privacy laws and creates a new government organization the california privacy protection agency cppa to enforce the law the majority of the cpra’s provisions will enter into force on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 2022 in addition to california comprehensive privacy laws were passed in virginia and colorado and are scheduled to enter into force in 2023 additionally the federal trade commission has increased its focus on privacy and data security practices at digital companies as evidenced by its levying in july 2019 of a firstofits kind 5 billion fine against facebook for privacy violations finally talks of a us federal privacy law are ongoing in congress with multiple proposals being considered and may lead to the passing of a new law in 2022 or the coming years 

concerns about harms and the use of dating products and social networking platforms for illegal conduct such as romance scams promotion of false or inaccurate information financial fraud and sextrafficking have produced and could continue to produce future legislation or other governmental action for example the eu and the united kingdom are considering new legislation on this topic with the united kingdom having released its online harms white paper and the eu introducing the digital services act which in each case would expose platforms to similar or more expansive liability in the united states government authorities elected officials and political candidates have called for amendments to section 230 of the communications decency act that would purport to limit or remove protections afforded to interactive computer service providers proposed legislation includes the earn it act the pact act the bad ads act the safe tech act and others if these proposed laws are passed or if future legislation or governmental action is proposed or taken to address concerns regarding such harms changes could be required to our products that could restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business generally or cause users to abandon our products see “risk factors—risks relating to our business—inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our business” 

our global businesses are subject to a variety of complex and continuously evolving income and other tax frameworks for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has reached political agreement for international tax reform which includes expanding the jurisdiction of member countries to tax businesses based on some level of digital presence as well as subjecting these companies to a global minimum tax rate of 15 the oecd’s framework calls for countries to repeal digital services taxes once the oecd’s reforms around allocating new taxing rights to markets come into full force the political agreement calls for reforms to be in force by 2023 and for the european commission to put forward a draft directive to implement the oecd framework within the eu by the end of 2022 given disagreements among the eu member countries on the implementation of the oecd framework it is not clear that the deadline will be met 

as a provider of services with a subscriptionbased element we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain us states and other countries that apply to our automaticallyrenewing subscription payment models for example the eu’s payment services directive psd2 which became effective in 2018 could impact our ability to process autorenewal payments or offer promotional or differentiated pricing for users in the eu similar legislation or regulation or changes to existing laws or regulations governing subscription payments have been adopted or are being considered in many us states 

finally certain us states and certain countries in the middle east and asia have laws that specifically govern dating services

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

the industry for relationship technologies is competitive with low switching costs and a consistent stream of new services and entrants and innovation by our competitors may disrupt our business 

the industry for relationship technologies is competitive with a consistent stream of new services and entrants some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical regions user demographics or other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future these advantages could enable these competitors to offer services that are more appealing to users and potential users than our services or to respond more quickly andor costeffectively than us to new or changing opportunities 

in addition within the industry for relationship technologies generally costs for consumers to switch between services are low and consumers have a propensity to try new approaches to connecting with people and to use multiple services at the same time as a result new services entrants and business models are likely to continue to emerge it is possible that a new service could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands through harnessing a new technology or a new or existing distribution channel creating a new or different approach to connecting people or some other means 

potential competitors include larger companies that could devote greater resources to the promotion or marketing of their services take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their services more quickly than we do potential competitors also include established social media companies that may develop features or services that may compete with ours or operators of mobile operating systems and app stores for example facebook has introduced a dating feature on its platform which it has rolled out globally and has grown dramatically in size supported by facebook’s massive worldwide user footprint these social media and mobile platform competitors could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets and ready access to existing large pools of potential users and personal information regarding those users to gain competitive advantages over us including by offering different features or services that users may prefer or offering their services to users at no charge which may enable them to acquire and engage users at the expense of our user growth or engagement 

if we are not able to compete effectively against our current or future competitors and services that may emerge the size and level of engagement of our user base may decrease which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the limited operating history of our newer brands and services makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

we seek to tailor each of our brands and services to meet the preferences of specific communities of users building a given brand or service is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures although certain of our newer brands and services have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time the historical growth rates of these brands and services may not be an indication of future growth rates for such services or our newer brands and services generally we have encountered and may continue to encounter risks and difficulties as we build our newer brands and services the failure to successfully scale these brands and services and address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth and profitability rely in part on our ability to attract and retain users through costeffective marketing efforts any failure in these efforts could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

attracting and retaining users for our services involve considerable expenditures for online and offline marketing historically we have had to increase our marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and sustain our growth 

evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities for example as traditional television viewership declines and as consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers the reach of many of our traditional advertising channels continues to contract similarly as consumers communicate less via email and more via text messaging messaging apps and other virtual means 

the reach of email campaigns designed to attract new and repeat users and retain current users for our services is adversely impacted additionally recent and future changes by large tech platforms such as apple and google to advertisers’ ability to access and use unique advertising identifiers cookies and other information to acquire potential users such as apple’s new rules regarding the collection and use of identifiers for advertising “idfa” have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our advertising efforts to continue to reach potential users and grow our businesses we must identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels such as mobile and online video platforms generally the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels and methods continue to be less developed proven and precise making it more difficult to assess returns on investment associated with our advertising efforts and to costeffectively identify potential users there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry any failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the recent covid19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic including the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has reached across the globe resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures intended to control the spread of the virus including lockdowns closures quarantines and travel bans as well as changes in consumer behavior as individuals have become reluctant to engage in social activities with people outside their households while some of these measures have been relaxed in certain parts of the world ongoing and future prevention and mitigation measures as well as the potential for some of these measures to be reinstituted in the event of repeat waves of the virus have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending and could materially adversely affect demand or users’ ability to pay for our services 

a public health epidemic including covid19 poses the risk that match group or its employees contractors vendors and other business partners may be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary course business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns necessitated for the health and wellbeing of our employees the employees of business partners or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities for example early on in the pandemic certain of our customer support vendors were impacted by government mandated shutdowns which adversely impacted the capability of the affected brands to respond timely and effectively to user inquiries and requests in addition in response to the covid19 outbreak we have taken several precautions that may adversely impact employee productivity such as continuing to allow employees to work remotely imposing travel restrictions and ongoing closures of office locations 

the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic pandemic or other health crisis on our business will depend on multiple factors that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including its severity location and duration and actions taken to contain or prevent further its spread additionally the covid19 pandemic could increase the magnitude of many of the other risks described in this annual report and have other adverse effects on our operations that we are not currently able to predict if our business and the markets in which we operate experience a prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions such as covid19 it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—trends affecting our business—impacts of the coronavirus” 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in various international markets including jurisdictions within the european union which we refer to as the “eu” and asia during periods of a strengthening us dollar our international revenues will be reduced when translated into us dollars in addition as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of our international revenues into us dollardenominated operating results affects the periodoverperiod comparability of such results and can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

the departure of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” has caused and may continue to cause volatility in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and the full impact of brexit remains uncertain see ‘‘item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations—principles of financial reporting—effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on revenue“ and item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency exchange risk” 

distribution and marketing of and access to our services relies in significant part on a variety of thirdparty platforms in particular mobile app stores if these third parties limit prohibit or otherwise interfere with features or services or change their policies in any material way it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we market and distribute our services including related mobile applications through a variety of thirdparty distribution channels including facebook which has rolled out its own dating service our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party certain platforms and channels have from time to time limited or prohibited advertisements for our services for a variety of reasons including poor behavior by other industry participants there is no assurance that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain marketing channels in the future if this were to happen with a significant marketing channel andor for a significant period of time our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally our mobile applications are almost exclusively accessed through the apple app store and google play store both apple and google have broad discretion to change their policies regarding their mobile operating systems and app stores in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute or market our applications through their stores our ability to update our applications including to make bug fixes or other feature updates or upgrades the features we provide our ability to access native functionality or other aspects of mobile devices and our ability to access information about our users that they collect to the extent either or both of them do so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected for example apple made changes to its policy on the processing of apple’s idfa requiring app users to opt in before their idfa can be accessed by an app as a consequence the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns at the user level has been limited and we and other app developers have experienced increased cost per registration additionally apple and google are known to retaliate against app developers who publicly or privately challenge their app store rules and policies and such retaliation has and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our services will depend in part on our ability to access collect and use personal data about our users and subscribers 

we rely on the apple app store and google play store to distribute and monetize our mobile applications our users and subscribers engage with these platforms directly and may be subject to requirements regarding the use of their payment systems for various transactions as a result of this disintermediation these platforms receive and do not share with us key user data that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly if these platforms continue to or increasingly limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to access collect and use key user data our ability to identify and communicate with a meaningful portion of our user and subscriber bases and provide services to help keep our users safe may be adversely impacted if so our customer relationship management efforts our ability to reach new segments of our user and subscriber bases and the population generally the efficiency of our paid marketing efforts the rates we are able to charge advertisers seeking to reach users and subscribers on our various properties our ability to comply with applicable law and our ability to identify and exclude users and subscribers whose access would violate applicable terms and conditions including underage individuals and bad actors may be negatively impacted and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as the distribution of our services through app stores increases in order to maintain our profit margins we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we rely on the apple app store and the google play store to distribute and monetize our mobile applications and related inapp services while our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features within these applications we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold however 

purchases of these subscriptions and features via our mobile applications are required to be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and google due to these requirements we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions google reduced its inapp purchase fees for subscription payments to 15 as of january 1 2022 while we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods given the ever increasing distribution of our services through app stores and the strict mandates to use the inapp payments systems tied into apple’s and google’s app stores we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected google announced that it will require all developers to process all inapp purchases of subscriptions and features entirely through their inapp payment system beginning on march 31 2022 instead of the original date announced by google of september 30 2021 to date google has not enforced such a requirement but if google does so our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected see “item 1—business—dependencies on services provided by others—app stores” 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals across the globe with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across match group and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and on our ability to enhance expand and adapt these systems and infrastructures in a timely and costeffective manner 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis we have experienced and may from time to time experience system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable and prevent our services from functioning properly for our users any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons further our systems and infrastructures are vulnerable to damage from fire power loss telecommunications failures acts of god and similar events while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations not all of our systems and infrastructures are fully redundant disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities and our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses that we may suffer any interruptions or outages regardless of the cause could negatively impact our users’ experiences with our platforms tarnish our brands’ reputations and decrease demand for our services any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experience of our users accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our various platforms ensure acceptable load times for our services and keep up with changes in technology and user preferences any failure to do so in a timely and costeffective manner could adversely affect our users’ experience with our various services and thereby negatively impact the demand for our services and could increase our costs either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced by third parties 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks and attempts to misappropriate customer information including personal user data credit card information and account login credentials while we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of our systems and infrastructure in related personnel and training and in employing a data minimization strategy where appropriate there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent 

significant breaches in our systems or other such events from occurring some of our systems have experienced past security incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future any cyber or similar attack we are unable to protect ourselves against could damage our systems and infrastructure prevent us from providing our services tarnish our brand reputation result in the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information of our users andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties 

the impact of cyber or similar attacks experienced by third parties who provide services to us or otherwise process data on our behalf could have a similar effect on us moreover even cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect us or our third party service providers or data processors may result in widespread access to user account login credentials that such users have used across multiple internet sites including our sites or a loss of consumer confidence generally which could make users less likely to use or continue to use online services generally including our services the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on the integrity of thirdparty systems and infrastructure 

we rely on third parties primarily data center and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services as well as third party computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers or any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers deterioration in the performance of these systems or cyber or similar attacks on these systems could impair our ability to provide our services or process transactions with our users which would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 1—business—dependencies on services provided by others—cloud and other services” 

if the security of personal and confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event and our reputation could be harmed 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential or sensitive information including credit card information and usertouser communications and enable our users to share their personal information with each other in some cases we engage third party service providers to store this information we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information but we have experienced past incidents and cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur in the future or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts when such events occur we may not be able to remedy them be required by law to notify regulators and individuals whose personal information was used or disclosed without authorization be subject to claims against us including government enforcement actions fines and litigation and have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such events including developing and implementing protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring when breaches of security or the security of our service providers occur the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures the security measures of our service providers and our reputation may be harmed we may lose current and potential users and our various brands’ reputation and competitive positions may be tarnished any or all of which might adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and international laws and regulations including with respect to data privacy and platform liability these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in changes to our business practices increased cost of operations declines in user growth or engagement claims monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business see “item 1—business—government regulation” these us federal state and municipal and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and subject to change as a result 

the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from state to state and country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or other government actions may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new services require changes to or cessation of certain business practices result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or modifications to existing business practices 

in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also adversely affect our business see “item 1—business—government regulation” to the extent such new or more stringent measures are required to be implemented impose new liability or limit or remove existing protections our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet or our services including laws or regulations that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access could decrease user demand for our service offerings and increase our cost of doing business for example in december 2017 the federal communications commission adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the united states including the repeal of specific rules against blocking throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by internet service providers to the extent internet service providers engage in such blocking throttling “paid prioritization” of content or similar actions as a result of this order and the adoption of similar laws or regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers when we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards in the case of a breach experienced by a third party the more sizable the third party’s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach to the extent our users are affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party such users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users and even if we could some users’ new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online or choose alternative payment methods that are less convenient or more costly for us or otherwise restrict our ability to process payments without significant user effort 

additionally if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions we may face litigation fines governmental enforcement action civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures significantly higher credit cardrelated and remediation costs or refusal by credit card processors to continue to process payments on our behalf any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our business 

users of our services have been and may in the future be physically financially emotionally or otherwise harmed by other individuals that such users met or may meet through the use of one of our services when one or more of our users suffers or alleges to have suffered any such harm we have in the past and could in the future experience negative publicity or legal action that could damage our reputation and our brands similar events affecting users of our competitors’ services have in the past and could in the future result in negative publicity for the dating industry generally which could in turn negatively affect our business 

in addition the reputations of our brands may be adversely affected by the actions of our users that are deemed to be hostile offensive defamatory inappropriate untrue or unlawful while we have systems and processes in place that aim to monitor and review the appropriateness of the content accessible through our services and have adopted policies regarding illegal offensive or inappropriate use of our services our users have in the past and could in the future nonetheless engage in activities that violate our policies these safeguards may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation and brands especially if such hostile offensive or inappropriate use is wellpublicized 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition we also rely upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies and trade secrets relating to our services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or sought in every country in which our services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or registered even if available 

we generally seek to apply for patents or other similar statutory protections as and when we deem appropriate based on thencurrent facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization our existing trademarks patents or trade secrets may be determined to be invalid or unenforceable or laws and interpretations of laws regarding the enforceability of existing intellectual property rights may change over time in a manner that provides less protection the occurrence of any of these events could tarnish of our brands’ reputation limit our ability to market them or impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets and patents or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others for example in 2021 we settled patent and trademark infringement litigation against muzmatch and settled with several other infringers outside of litigation any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets including certain markets in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with certain of our international operations 

operating internationally particularly in countries in which we have limited experience exposes us to a number of risks in addition to those otherwise described in this annual report such as 

• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• differing levels of social and technological acceptance of our services or lack of acceptance of them generally 

• differing and potentially adverse tax laws 

• compliance challenges due to different laws and regulatory environments particularly in the case of privacy data security intermediary or platform liability and consumer protection 

• competitive environments that favor local businesses or local knowledge of such environments 

• limitations on the level of intellectual property protection and 

• trade sanctions political unrest terrorism war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events such as covid19 

the occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect our international operations which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions 

we have made acquisitions in the past including our acquisition of hyperconnect in june 2021 and continue to seek potential acquisition candidates we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with historical and future acquisitions if we are unable to 

• properly value prospective acquisitions especially those with limited operating histories 

• fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with acquired businesses 

• successfully integrate the operations and accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of the acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems 

• retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and 

• successfully support the acquired businesses in executing on strategic plans including expansion into geographies where we have presence and experience 

furthermore we may not be successful in addressing other challenges encountered in connection with our acquisitions and the anticipated benefits of one or more of our acquisitions may not be realized in addition such acquisitions can result in material diversion of management’s attention or other resources from our existing businesses the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are and from time to time may become subject to litigation and various legal proceedings including litigation and proceedings related to employment matters intellectual property matters privacy and consumer protection laws as well as stockholder derivative suits class action lawsuits mass arbitrations and other matters that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief results in significant costs for legal representation arbitration fees or other legal or related services or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is time consuming and expensive we evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate if possible the amount of potential losses based on these assessments and estimates we may establish reserves andor disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings as and when required or appropriate these 

assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment as a result actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 3—legal proceedings” 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness 

as of december 31 2021 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 40 billion and borrowing availability of 7496 million under our revolving credit facility 

our indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes 

• limiting our ability to use operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions or invest in other areas such as developing new brands services or exploiting business opportunities 

• restricting our business operations due to financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and certain of our subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness including certain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us and 

• exposing us to potential events of default if not cured or waived under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries’ debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

although the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures related to our senior notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the risks described above could increase 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 

our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

• our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control and 

• our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility the availability of which will depend on among other things our complying with the covenants in the thenexisting agreements governing our indebtedness 

there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business 

operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 

variable rate indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur under our credit agreement will subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

we currently have 425 million of indebtedness outstanding under our term loan and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement borrowings under term loan are and any borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be at variable rates of interest indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk see “item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

exchange of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

we are obligated as a guarantor under the indentures relating to the exchangeable notes the exchange of some or all of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon exchange while the exchangeable note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilutive effect on our common stock upon any exchange andor offset any cash payment the issuers of the exchangeable notes would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of the exchanged notes the warrants have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling of our common stock by market participants because the exchange of the exchangeable notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated exchange of the exchangeable notes could depress the price of our common stock 

risks relating to the separation 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve through the separation 

we believe that the intended strategic and financial benefits of the separation should be achieved however there can be no assurance of this or that we will be able to attract transaction partners using our capital stock as acquisition currency and that analysts and investors will regard our new corporate structure as more clear and simple than our former corporate structure 

if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to fail to qualify as generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and our stockholders could suffer material adverse consequences 

following the completion of the separation and the merger of former match group into a whollyowned subsidiary “merger sub” of former iac the “merger” former match group’s successor became a whollyowned subsidiary of match group and most of former iac’s existing other subsidiaries came to be held under a separate public company former iac and iac received opinions from outside counsel that the separation and related transactions taken together and the merger were taxfree for us federal income tax purposes these opinions were based upon and rely on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations and undertakings of former iac former match group iac and match group including relating to the past and future conduct of former iac former match group iac and match group if any of these representations or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if any of the representations or covenants contained in any of the transactionrelated agreements or in any document relating to the opinions of counsel is or becomes inaccurate or is not complied with by former iac former match group iac match group or any of their respective subsidiaries the opinions of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of counsel regarding the transactions the us internal revenue service “irs” could determine that some or all of the transactions effected in connection with the separation should be treated as taxable for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinions of counsel were based are inaccurate or have not been complied with moreover even if the foregoing representations assumptions or undertakings are accurate and have been complied with the opinions of counsel merely represent the judgment of such counsel and are not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in 

the opinions of counsel accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the transactions effected in connection with the separation do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such a challenge parties to the separation including match group could be subject to tax with respect to the separation 

for example if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” in general for us federal income tax purposes we would recognize a taxable gain as if the distribution of new iac stock in connection with the separation had been sold in a taxable sale for its fair market value even if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code taxable gain may be triggered under section 355e of the code if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were or later transactions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest by vote or value in us or iac for this purpose any acquisitions of i former iac stock or former match group stock before the separation or ii iac stock or match group stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after the separation are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or iac may be able to rebut that presumption 

in addition to potential tax liabilities relating to former match group we and our subsidiaries could be liable to satisfy any tax liabilities relating to former iac or iac with respect to the separation if their taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes were successfully challenged by the irs while in some cases iac may be obligated under the tax matters agreement to indemnify us for some or all of such taxes even in those cases there is no assurance that they will in fact indemnify us 

in addition if the merger were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we would be subject to tax on the transfer of the assets of former match to merger sub if we or our subsidiaries were required to pay taxes imposed on us with respect to the separation our cash flows would be adversely affected 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions following the separation 

we believe we will generally be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions however under current us federal income tax law a distribution that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the distributing corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of both the distributing corporation and the corporation the stock of which is distributed to preserve the taxfree treatment of the transactions effected in connection with the separation the tax matters agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the twoyear period following the separation except in specific circumstances we are generally restricted from 1 ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses 2 entering into certain transactions or series of transactions pursuant to which all or a portion of our shares of common stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 3 liquidating or merging or consolidating with any other person 4 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 5 repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain openmarket transactions or 6 taking or failing to take any other action that would cause the transactions effected in connection with the separation to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other hand 

certain of our directors and executive officers and directors of iac own both match group common stock and iac common stock this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when match group’s directors and iac’s executive officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for match group and iac for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between match group and iac regarding the terms of the agreements governing 

the separation and the relationship between match group and iac thereafter potential conflicts of interest could also arise if match group and iac enter into any commercial arrangements in the future 

in addition joseph levin serves as a director of match group while also serving as an executive officer of iac and alan g spoon serves as a director of each of match group and iac we believe that having a limited number of senior iac management members serve on our board for a transitional period will be beneficial to us however the fact that messrs levin and spoon hold positions with both match group and iac could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of them when facing decisions that may affect both match group and iac and each of them also faces conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between match group and iac 

our certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us 

our certificate of incorporation includes a “corporate opportunity” provision in which match group and its affiliates renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to any of match group’s directors or officers who are also officers or directors of iac 

generally match group’s officers or directors who are also iac’s officers or directors will not be liable to match group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty because such person fails to communicate or offer to match group a corporate opportunity that has been communicated or offered to iac that may also be a corporate opportunity of match group or because such person communicates or offers to iac any corporate opportunity that may also be a corporate opportunity of match group in order for any match group director or officer who is also an iac director or officer not to be liable to match group or its stockholders such opportunity cannot become known to the officer or director in his or her capacity as a match group director or officer and cannot be presented to any party other than iac in addition such officer or director cannot pursue such opportunity in his or her individual capacity the corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between match group and iac because the provision effectively permits any of match group’s directors or officers who also serve as an officer or director of iac to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of to match group 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

you may experience dilution due to the issuance of additional securities in the future  

our dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock restricted stock unit awards equity awards denominated in the equity of our nonpublic subsidiaries but settleable in shares of our common stock the exchangeable notes and the exchangeable note warrants 

these dilutive securities are reflected in our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 for more information see “note 10—earnings per share” to the consolidated financial statements included in “part ii item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” intraquarter movements in our stock price could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations 

we do not expect to declare any regular cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock instead we anticipate that all of our future earnings will be retained to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business we are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock consequently investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment investors seeking regular cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous including provisions which 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt 

• establish a classified board of directors as a result of which our board is divided into three classes with each class serving for staggered threeyear terms which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders 

• eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• provide that certain litigation against us can be brought only in delaware subject to certain exceptions and 

• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

consumer class action litigation challenging tinder’s agetiered pricing 

on may 28 2015 a putative statewide class action was filed against tinder in state court in california see allan candelore v tinder inc  no bc583162 superior court of california county of los angeles the complaint principally alleged that tinder violated california’s unruh civil rights act by offering and charging users age 30 and over a higher price than younger users for subscriptions to its premium tinder plus service the complaint sought certification of a class of california tinder plus subscribers age 30 and over and damages in an unspecified amount on december 29 2015 in accordance with a prior ruling sustaining tinder’s demurrer the

in a related development on june 21 2019 in a substantially similar putative class action asserting the same substantive claims and pending in federal district court in california the court entered judgment granting final approval of a classwide settlement the terms of which are not material to the company see lisa kim v tinder inc  no 18cv3093 central district of california because the approved settlement class in kim subsumes the proposed settlement class in candelore  the judgment in kim would effectively render candelore a singleplaintiff lawsuit accordingly on july 11 2019 two objectors to the kim settlement represented by the plaintiff’s counsel in candelore  filed a notice of appeal from the kim judgment with the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit oral argument on the appeal occurred on january 15 2021 on august 17 2021 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed and remanded the district court’s decision on november 3 2021 the trial court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on december 13 2021 plaintiff filed an amended motion for final approval of the proposed settlement agreement the terms of which are not material to the company 

on november 13 2019 the trial court in candelore issued an order staying the class claims in the case pending the ninth circuit’s decision on the kim appeal on october 5 2021 the trial court lifted the stay we believe that the allegations in the candelore lawsuit are without merit and will continue to defend vigorously against it

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2021 developments 

on march 26 2021 match group holdings ii llc “mg holdings ii” amended its credit agreement to provide for a 400 million incremental “delayed draw” term loan facility “delayed draw term loan” the proceeds of which could be used only to finance a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of hyperconnect inc “hyperconnect” the delayed draw term loan was terminated effective june 18 2021 according to its terms 

on june 17 2021 match group completed the acquisition of hyperconnect the purchase price was 175 billion net of cash acquired the acquisition was funded with cash on hand and the issuance of 59 million shares of match group common stock 

on october 4 2021 mg holdings ii completed a private offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3625 senior notes the proceeds from these notes were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding 2022 exchangeable notes for general corporate purposes and to pay expenses associated with the offering 

on october 4 2021 we repurchased approximately 414 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2022 exchangeable notes for approximately 15 billion including accrued and unpaid interest on the repurchased notes funded with 

i net proceeds of 8790 million from a registered direct offering to the holders of the 2022 exchangeable notes being repurchased of 5534098 shares of our common stock at a price of 15883 per share 

ii approximately 420 million of net proceeds from the 3625 senior notes offering and 

iii net proceeds of approximately 201 million from the unwind of a proportionate amount of outstanding hedges and warrants corresponding to the 2022 exchangeable notes being repurchased 

in connection with these transactions the statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 reflects a loss of 145 million included in other expense net primarily related to the change in fair value of the embedded derivative we recognized during the period between our entering into the various agreements on september 22 2021 and settlement on october 4 2021 

on december 1 2021 we agreed to settle the pending threatened and potential claims at issue in rad et al v iacinteractivecorp et al and related arbitrations under the terms of the agreement match group agreed to pay the plaintiffs and claimants 441 million and plaintiffs and claimants agreed to dismiss all claims in trial and in arbitration we expect to pay the settlement amount in 2022 utilizing cash on hand the 441 million settlement is included in other expense net for the year ended december 31 2021 

updated operating and financial metrics 

in 2021 we adjusted our key operating and financial data to provide better insight into the performance of our business we are disclosing this data in three geographic areas—americas europe and apac and other 

additionally rather than presenting average subscribers and average revenue per subscriber “arpu” we now present payers and revenue per payer “rpp” as defined below unlike average subscribers which included only users who purchase a subscription and were counted on a daily basis payers include all users from whom we earn revenue including those who make only à la carte purchases and are counted as unique users in a given month similarly arpu was a daily metric and included direct revenue sourced from subscribers only whereas rpp is a monthly metric and includes all direct revenue we believe that payers and rpp which account for nonsubscriber users and the associated revenue is more useful in evaluating the performance of our business 

we believe presenting direct revenue payers and rpp in three geographic regions enables investors to better understand our operating performance and is appropriate given our expanding global footprint the new metrics also better account for the increasing à la carte revenue as a percentage of total revenue that the company earns and enhance comparability with our peers 

additionally we have updated the title of our primary nongaap measure to “adjusted operating income” from our previous title “adjusted ebitda” we believe this updated title better reflects how management views the nongaap measure in relation to the closest gaap measure operating income the calculation of the nongaap measure has not changed and therefore the reconciliation of net income to operating income and to adjusted operating income have not changed see “nongaap financial measures” below for the full definition of adjusted operating income and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to match group inc shareholders to operating income and adjusted operating income 

separation from iac 

on june 30 2020 the companies formerly known as match group inc referred to as “former match group” and iacinteractivecorp referred to as “former iac” completed the separation of the company from iac through a series of transactions that resulted in two separate public companies—1 match group which consists of the businesses of former match group and certain financing subsidiaries previously owned by former iac and 2 iac consisting of former iac’s businesses other than match group the “separation” as part of the separation former match group merged with and into mg holdings ii an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of match group with mg holdings ii surviving the merger as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of match group as a result of the separation the operations of former iac businesses other than match group are presented as discontinued operations

trends affecting our business 

over the last several years we have seen significant changes in our business tinder has grown from incubation to the largest contributing brand in our portfolio with our more established brands returning to growth as well this has allowed us to invest in or acquire brands such as hyperconnect and hinge and incubate new brands such as chispa™ blk ®  and upward ®  where we have seen initial growth and we expect to see additional growth opportunities into the future with our evolving portfolio of brands we have seen a number of significant trends in our business in recent years including the following 

lower cost users all of our brands rely on wordofmouth or free user acquisition to varying degrees wordofmouth acquisition is typically a function of scale with larger communities driving greater numbers of referrals youthfulness with the viral effect being more pronounced in younger populations due in part to a significantly higher concentration of people seeking connections in any given social circle and the increased adoption of social media and similar platforms among such populations and monetization rate with people 

generally more likely to talk openly about using technologies to meet people that are less heavily monetized additionally some but not all of our brands spend meaningfully on paid marketing accordingly the average amount we spend to acquire a user differs significantly across brands based in large part on each brand’s mix of paid and free acquisition channels as our mix has shifted toward younger users our mix of acquisition channels has shifted toward lower cost channels driving a decline over the past several years in the average amount we spend to acquire a new user across our portfolio as a percentage of revenue our costs of acquiring users have declined 

changing paid acquisition dynamics even as our acquisition of lower cost users increases paid acquisition of users remains an important driver of our business the channels through which we market our brands are always evolving but we are currently in a period of rapid change as tv and video consumption patterns evolve and internet consumption occurs regularly on mobile devices as we adapt our paid marketing activities to maximize user engagement with our brands we may increase our use of paid advertising at brands where we traditionally relied on wordofmouth engagement to leverage these shifts in media consumption patterns and fuel international growth other brands in our portfolio may reduce paid marketing activities to reflect the change in audience engagement 

inapp purchase fees purchases made by our customers through mobile applications as opposed to desktop or mobile web continue to increase purchases processed through the inapp payments systems provided by the apple app store and google play store are subject to inapp purchase fees which are generally 30 of the purchase price google reduced its inapp purchase fees for subscriptions to 15 as of january 1 2022 as a result the percentage of our revenues paid to apple and google continues to be a significant expense in 2019 tinder began offering subscribers an alternative payment method to google’s inapp payment system similar to the payment alternatives other brands in our portfolio have historically offered to subscribers through mobile apps on android google has announced that beginning in march 2022 all purchases will be required to be processed through the google play store and subject to inapp purchase fees to the extent that app stores fee change or the mix of our revenue generated through app stores shifts our results in particular our profit measures could be impacted 

the manner in which apple and google operate these services is being reviewed by legislative and regulatory bodies globally notably the republic of korea recently adopted legislation that prohibits apple and google from requiring that developers exclusively use apple and google to process payments in the netherlands the authority for consumers and markets found apple’s requirement that online dating companies must exclusively use apple’s inapp payment violates both dutch and european union law multiple other jurisdictions including the european union united kingdom russia japan and india are investigating considering regulatory action or considering legislation to restrict or prohibit these practices the united states congress as well as a number of state legislatures are also considering legislation that would regulate certain terms of the relationships between developers and apple and google and prohibit apple and google from requiring inapp payment processing 

increase in acceptance and growth of technologies to meet people globally over the past decade there has been meaningful growth in the usage of technologies to meet people in north america and western europe and we see the potential for similar growth in the rest of the world in the years ahead as more internetconnected people seeking connections utilize technologies to meet people and the stigma around using such technologies continues to erode we believe that there is potential for accelerating growth in the use of these technologies globally 

increased consumption of video and live experiences with more recent advances in technology most notably live video and with an increasing amount of time spent online there are new ways that people want to meet and get to know one another that are more reflective of how people engage inperson our brands are evolving to incorporate a variety of new technologies that enable users to interact in a variety of ways including video capabilities and live experiences these technologies were already being incorporated at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 and we are continuing to further incorporate them into our portfolio of brands we expect new technologies to continue to drive user engagement and expect other technologies beyond video and live experiences to be tested in our services and incorporated into our apps in the future 

impacts of the coronavirus when the novel coronavirus “covid19” first hit western europe and then certain major metropolitan centers in the us in the spring of 2020 particularly new york city engagement 

messages sent daily active users swipe ® activity on the tinder platform increased significantly but subscribers who purchase a subscription for the first time “firsttime subscribers” declined at most of our brands as meeting in person was restricted as we entered the summer months of 2020 propensity to pay rebounded across our portfolio and firsttime subscribers climbed amid reduced covid19 cases but then faced new headwinds at the end of 2020 as the second wave of covid19 cases and related lockdowns took hold in 2021 we saw a new normalization level as vaccines continued to roll out globally even as several countries experienced a third wave of cases we saw strong recovery in the us and improvement in europe as well but important markets for us such as india south korea brazil and japan were further behind on the covid19 curve the recent omicron variant surge has caused a modest impact on our business with rolling global effects as the wave passes through the us europe and then we expect asia while we have continued to feel the effects of covid19 on our business as new waves and variants have emerged the business has proven to be quite resilient over the last two years 

other factors affecting the comparability of our results 

advertising spend our advertising spend which is included in our selling and marketing expense has consistently been one of our larger operating expenses how we deploy our advertising spend varies among brands with the majority of our advertising spend taking place online including search engines social media sites streaming services and influencers additionally some brands utilize television and outofhome marketing campaigns such as on outdoor billboards for established brands we seek to optimize for total return on advertising spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting spend to focus on marketing channels and markets that generate returns above our thresholds our datadriven approach provides us the flexibility to scale and optimize our advertising spend we spend advertising dollars against an expected lifetime value of a payer that is realized over a multiyear period and while this advertising spend is intended to be profitable on that basis it is nearly always negative during the period in which the expense is incurred for newer brands that are gaining scale or existing brands that are expanding into new geographies we may make incremental advertising investments to establish the brand before optimizing monetization of the brand in general our more established brands spend a higher proportion of their revenue on advertising while our newer brands spend a lower proportion and tend to rely more on word of mouth and other viral marketing additionally advertising spend is typically higher during the first quarter of our fiscal year and lower during the fourth quarter see “seasonality” below 

seasonality historically our business has experienced seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results particularly with respect to our profit measurements this is driven primarily by a higher concentration of advertising spend in the first quarter when advertising prices tend to be the lowest and demand for our services tends to be highest and a lower concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter when advertising costs tend to be highest and demand for our services tends to be lowest seasonality is not consistent across our brands with brands targeted at older users generally showing more seasonality than brands targeted at younger users 

international markets our services are available across the world our international revenue represented 54 and 53 of our total revenue for years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we vary our pricing to align with local market conditions and our international businesses typically earn revenue in local currencies as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results 

2021 consolidated results 

in 2021 revenue operating income and adjusted operating income grew 25 14 and 19 respectively yearoveryear revenue growth was primarily due to strong growth at tinder hinge and plentyoffish and the acquisition of hyperconnect in june 2021 operating income and adjusted operating income grew at a slower rate than revenue primarily due to the acquisition of hyperconnect higher cost of revenue primarily due to inapp purchase fees higher general and administrative expense primarily related to higher legal and other professional fees and increased compensation expense as a result of increased headcount higher product development expenses from increased headcount at tinder and hinge partially offset by lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue operating income was further impacted by higher amortization of intangibles due to the acquisition of hyperconnect and higher stockbased compensation expense primarily due to new grants made during the year and new grants associated with the hyperconnect acquisition partially offset by lower expense for award modifications

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with “item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue 

a our ability to eliminate duplicate payers at a brand level for periods prior to q2 2020 is impacted by data privacy requirements which require that we anonymize data after 12 months therefore payer data for those periods is likely overstated additionally as payers is a component of the rpp calculation rpp is likely commensurately understated for these same periods due to these data privacy limitations

nongaap financial measures 

match group reports adjusted operating income and revenue excluding foreign exchange effects both of which are supplemental measures to us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” adjusted operating income is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business on which our internal budget is based and by which management is compensated revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results these nongaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results match group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measures presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measures which we discuss below 

adjusted operating income 

adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors the above items are excluded from our adjusted operating income measure because they are noncash in nature adjusted operating income has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses 

noncash expenses that are excluded from adjusted operating income 

stockbased compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options restricted stock units “rsus” performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method however performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period to the extent that stockbased awards are settled on a net basis we remit the required taxwithholding amounts from our current funds 

depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions at the time of acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as customer lists trade names and technology are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to i acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of trade names and trademarks and ii goodwill which are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

the following table reconciles net earnings attributable to match group inc shareholders to operating income and adjusted operating income 

effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on revenue 

due to our global reach the impact of foreign exchange rates on the company may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant since our results are reported in us dollars international revenue is favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies we believe the presentation of revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange in addition to reported revenue helps improve the ability to understand the company’s performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match group’s core operating results 

revenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates the percentage change in revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue is translated using prior period exchange rates 

the following tables present the impact of foreign exchange effects on total revenue and direct revenue by geographic region and rpp on a total basis and by geographic region for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 and the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of match group’s accounting policies contained in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is the company’s largest asset with a carrying value of 24 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 representing 48 and 42 respectively of the company’s total assets indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the company’s acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 5767 million and 2266 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value 

in performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment the company has the option under gaap to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment the company does not perform a quantitative test which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of october 1 if needed the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded the 2021 and 2020 annual assessments did not identify any impairments 

as a result of the separation in 2020 the company had a negative carrying value for the company’s annual goodwill test at both october 1 2021 and 2020 additionally an impairment test of goodwill was not necessary because there were no factors identified that would indicate an impairment loss the company continued to have a negative carrying value at december 31 2021 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying values the company’s policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 in part because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent due to the recent acquisition of hyperconnect and the process to allocate the purchase price as of the purchase date the intangible assets of hyperconnect were considered qualitatively as of october 1 2021 for assets in which a quantitative assessment was performed the company determines the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future 

cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company’s trade names and trademarks the future cash flows are based on the company’s most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the company’s estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the company’s annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 10 to 16 in 2021 and 10 to 23 in 2020 and the royalty rates used ranged from 5 to 8 in both 2021 and 2020 

if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment equal to the excess is recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized an impairment charge related to the match ® brand in the uk and the meetic brand in europe of 46 million during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized an impairment charge on the match brand in the uk of 66 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 no indefinitelived intangible asset balance had an estimated fair value less than 110 of carrying value 

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets consisting of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets was 3583 million and 1121 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

income taxes 

match group is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of asset and liabilities as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment 

a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position such tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustment we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions the final outcome of these matters may vary significantly from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the income tax provision in 

the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

stockbased compensation 

the company recorded stockbased compensation expense of 1468 million and 1023 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

stockbased compensation at the company is complex due to our desire to attract retain and reward employees at many of our brands by allowing them to benefit from the value they help to create we also utilize equity awards as part of our acquisition strategy we accomplish these objectives in part by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our nonpublic subsidiaries as well as in match group inc we further refine this approach by tailoring the terms of equity awards as appropriate for example we issue certain equity awards with vesting conditioned on the achievement of specified performance targets such as revenue or profits these awards are referred to as performance awards in other cases we condition the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of value targets for a specific subsidiary or the company’s stock price these awards are referred to as marketbased awards 

the company issues restricted stock units “rsus” and performancebased stock units “psus” the value of rsus with vesting subject only to continued service is based on the fair value of match group common stock on the grant date the value of rsus that include a market condition is based on fair value estimated using a lattice model the value of rsus is expensed as stockbased compensation expense over the applicable vesting term for psu grants the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of match group common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s longterm debt 

at december 31 2021 the company’s outstanding longterm debt was 40 billion of which 35 billion consists of senior notes and exchangeable senior notes that bear interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the required payments on the fixedrate debt will exceed those on debt based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 1576 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period at december 31 2021 the 425 million term loan bore interest at a variable rate libor plus 175 at december 31 2021 the rate in effect was 191 if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense and payments on the term loan would increase or decrease respectively by 43 million based upon the outstanding balance and rate in effect at december 31 2021 

the credit facility and the term loan provide for a benchmark replacement should the libor rate not be available the rate used would be agreed to between the administrative agent and match group and may be based upon a secured overnight financing rate at the federal reserve bank of new york additional information about the benchmark replacement can be found amendment no 6 to the credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union “eu” and asia we are exposed to foreign exchange risk for primarily the euro and british pound “gbp” 

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 international revenue accounted for 54 53 and 53 respectively of our consolidated revenue we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions carried out in a currency other than the us dollar and investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results the average gbp and euro exchange rates strengthened against the us dollar by 7 and 4 respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 foreign currency exchange rate changes during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 positively impacted revenue by 352 million and negatively impacted revenue by 64 million respectively or 1 and less than 1 of total revenue respectively see “nongaap financial measures” in “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for the definition of revenue excluding foreign exchange effects and a reconciliation of revenue to revenue excluding foreign exchange effects 

foreign currency exchange losses included in the company’s earnings for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are 18 million 06 million and 09 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange gains or losses historically have not been material to the company as a result we have not historically hedged any foreign currency exposures although we may hedge foreign currencies in the future to limit the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies could adversely affect our future results of operations

the business of creating meaningful connections 

our goal is to spark meaningful connections for users around the world consumers’ dating preferences vary significantly influenced in part by demographics geography cultural norms religion and intent for example seeking casual dating or more serious relationships as a result the market for dating products is fragmented and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole 

prior to the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices human connections traditionally were limited by social circles geography and time people met through work colleagues friends and family in school at church at social gatherings in bars and restaurants or in other social settings today the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships create new interactions and develop meaningful connections additionally the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas across the world that previously served as barriers to individuals using technology to help find and develop those connections 

we believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users including 

• expanded options  dating products provide users access to a large pool of people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet 

• efficiency  the search and matching features as well as the profile information available on dating products allow users to filter a large number of individuals in a short period of time increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone 

• more comfort and control  compared to the traditional ways that people meet dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around identifying and reaching out to new people who are interested in connecting this leads to many people who would otherwise be passive participants in the dating process taking a more active role 

• safely meet new people dating products can offer a safer way to contact new people for the firsttime by limiting the amount of personal information exchanged and providing an opportunity to vet a new connection before meeting in person including via video communication 

• convenience  the nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time regardless of where they are 

depending on a person’s circumstances at any given time dating products can act as a supplement to or substitute for traditional means of meeting people when selecting a dating product we believe that users consider the following attributes 

• brand recognition and scale  brand is very important users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and more tools to help the user date safely and securely generally successful dating brands depend on large active communities of users strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users 

• successful experiences  demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through wordofmouth recommendations successful experiences also drive repeat usage 

• community identification  users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can relate by selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic religion geography or intent users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify 

• product features and user experience  users tend to gravitate towards dating products that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them such as questionbased matching algorithms locationbased features or search capabilities user experience is also driven by the type of user interface for example using our patented swipe ® technology versus scrolling a particular mix of free and paid features ease of use privacy and security users expect every interaction with a dating product to be seamless and intuitive 

given varying consumer preferences we have adopted a brand portfolio approach through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers we believe that this approach maximizes our ability to capture additional users 

our portfolio 

dating is a highly personal endeavor and consumers have a wide variety of preferences that determine what type of dating product they choose as a result our strategy focuses on a portfolio approach of various brands in order to reach a broad range of users many of our brands have a long legacy while others emerged during the time when mobile devices proliferated the following is a list of our key brands 

tinder tinder incubated at the company was launched in 2012 and has since risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the online dating category growing to over 67 million average subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2020 tinder’s patented swipe technology has led to significant adoption particularly among 18 to 30 yearold users who were previously underserved by the online dating category tinder employs a freemium model through which users are allowed to enjoy many of the core features of tinder for free including limited use of the swipe right ® feature with unlimited communication with other users however to enjoy premium features such as unlimited use of the swipe right feature a tinder user must subscribe to one of several subscription offerings tinder plus ®  launched in early 2015 tinder gold™ which was launched in late summer 2017 or tinder platinum™ launched in late 2020 tinder users and subscribers may also pay for certain premium features such as super likes™ and boosts on a payperuse basis in 2020 tinder launched face to face a onetoone real time video feature allowing users to connect in a new way within the app

staying competitive 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products in addition to these other dating brands we also compete with social media platforms socialdiscovery apps offline dating services such as inperson matchmakers and other traditional means of meeting people 

we believe that our ability to attract new users to our brands will depend primarily upon the following factors 

• our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of dating products particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the associated stigma is only beginning to erode 

• continued growth in internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world particularly emerging markets 

• the continued strength of our established brands and the growth of our newer brands 

• the breadth and depth of our active communities of users 

• our brands’ reputation for trust and safety 

• our ability to evolve our products to keep up with user requirements social trends and the everevolving technological landscape 

• our products’ ability to keep up with the constantly changing regulatory landscape in particular as it relates to the regulation of consumer digital media platforms 

• our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our products 

• our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies and 

• the design and functionality of our products 

a large portion of dating customers use multiple products over a given period of time either concurrently or sequentially making our broad portfolio of brands a competitive advantage 

where we earn our revenue 

all our products enable users to establish a profile and review other users’ profiles without charge each product also offers additional features some of which are free and some of which require payment depending on the particular product in general access to premium features requires a subscription which is typically offered in packages primarily ranging from one month to six months depending on the product and circumstance prices differ meaningfully within a given brand depending on the duration of a subscription the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers in addition to subscriptions many of our products offer users certain features such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or highlight themselves to a specific user and these features are offered on a payperuse or à la carte basis the precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brandbybrand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution 

our direct revenue is primarily derived from users in the form of recurring subscriptions which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time and to a lesser extent from à la carte features where users pay a nonrecurring fee for a specific consumable benefit or feature each of our brands offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its own unique community in addition to direct revenue from our users we generate indirect revenue from advertising which makes up a much smaller percentage of our overall revenue as compared to direct revenue 

dependencies on services provided by others 

app stores 

we fully rely on the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications and related inapp products while our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features through these applications we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold however purchases of these subscriptions and features are required in most cases to be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and google due to these requirements we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions 

additionally when our users and subscribers access and pay through the app stores the platforms may receive personal data about our users and subscribers that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly the platforms have restricted our access to much of that data 

both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our applications including the amount of and requirement to pay certain fees associated with purchases required to be facilitated by apple and google through our applications and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our applications through their stores the features we provide the manner in which we market our inapp products and our ability to access information about our users and subscribers that they collect apple or google could also make changes to their operating systems or payment services that could negatively impact our business including by unilaterally raising the prices for those services 

cloud services 

we rely on third parties primarily data center service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services as well as third party computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

problems experienced by thirdparty data center service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services upon which brands including tinder pairs and hinge rely the telecommunications network providers with which we or they contract or with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers could also adversely affect us any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers such as amazon web services or any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products or process transactions with our users which would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

sales and marketing 

all of our brands rely on wordofmouth or free user acquisition to varying degrees other brands rely on paid user acquisition for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns video advertising business development or partnership deals creating content and partnering with influencers to promote our products our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising outofhome advertising and public relations efforts 

intellectual property 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success 

for example we rely heavily upon the use of trademarks primarily tinder match plentyoffish okcupid meetic ourtime pairs and hinge and associated domain names taglines and logos to market our products and applications and build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition we have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names product names taglines and 

logos and renew existing trademark and service mark registrations in the united states and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine it to be necessary or otherwise appropriate and costeffective in addition we have a trademark and service mark monitoring policy pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours as well as potential unauthorized use of our material trademarks and service marks our enforcement of this policy affords us valuable protection under current laws rules and regulations we also reserve and file registrations to the extent available and renew existing registrations for domain names that we believe are material to our business 

we also rely upon a combination of inlicensed thirdparty and proprietary trade secrets including proprietary algorithms and upon patented and patentpending technologies processes and features relating to our matching process systems or features products and services with expiration dates from 2023 to 2036 we have an ongoing invention recognition program pursuant to which we apply for patents to the extent we determine it to be core to our product or businesses or otherwise appropriate and costeffective 

we rely on a combination of internal and external controls including applicable laws rules and regulations and contractual restrictions with employees contractors customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish protect and otherwise control access to our various intellectual property rights 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business including among others broadband internet access online commerce advertising user privacy data protection intermediary liability protection of minors consumer protection general safety sextrafficking taxation and securities law compliance as a result we could be subject to actions based on negligence regulatory compliance various torts and trademark and copyright infringement among other actions see “risk factors—risks relating to our business—our business is subject to complex and evolving us and international laws and regulations including with respect to data privacy and platform liability these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in changes to our business practices increased cost of operations declines in user growth or engagement claims monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business” and “—risks relating to our business—we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties” 

because we receive store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users we are particularly impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy the storage sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches in many of the countries in which we operate for example in 2016 the european commission adopted the general data protection act which we refer to as “gdpr” a comprehensive eu privacy and data protection reform that became effective in may 2018 the act applies to companies established in the eu or otherwise providing services or monitoring the behavior of people located in the eu and provides for significant penalties in case of noncompliance as well as a private right of action for individual claimants gdpr will continue to be interpreted by eu data protection regulators which have and may in the future require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional costs risks and liabilities the eu is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communications socalled “eprivacy” directive notably to amend rules on the use of cookies direct marketing and processing of private communications and related metadata which may also require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional costs risks and liabilities in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu declared transfers of personal data on the basis of the european commission’s privacy shield decision illegal and stipulated stricter requirements for the transfer of personal data based on standard contract clauses this judgement and the resulting decisions and guidelines from eu supervisory authorities may require changes to our business practices and generate additional costs risks and liabilities brexit could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the united kingdom at the same time many countries in which we do business have already adopted or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information have been introduced in the us congress various us state legislatures including those in new york illinois california and many other states are considering privacy legislation in 2021 other us state 

legislatures have already passed and enacted privacy legislation most prominently the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which was signed into law in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1 2020 with full enforcement commencing on june 30 2020 on november 3 2020 the “california privacy rights act of 2020” cpra was enacted which expands the state’s consumer privacy laws and creates a new government organization the california privacy protection agency cppa to enforce the law the majority of the cpra’s provisions will enter into force on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 2022 additionally the federal trade commission has increased its focus on privacy and data security practices at digital companies as evidenced by its levying in july 2019 of a firstofits kind 5 billion fine against facebook for privacy violations finally talks of a us federal privacy law are ongoing in congress with multiple proposals having been made already and may lead to the passing of a new law in 2021 or the coming years 

concerns about harms and the use of dating products and social networking platforms for illegal conduct such as romance scams promotion of false or inaccurate information financial fraud and sextrafficking have produced and could continue to produce future legislation or other governmental action for example in january 2020 the oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy of the us house of representatives launched an investigation into the online dating industry’s user safety policies including certain practices of match group’s businesses relating to the identification and removal of registered sex offenders and underage individuals from our platforms the eu and the united kingdom are also considering new legislation on this topic with the united kingdom having released its online harms white paper and the eu introducing the digital services act which in each case would expose platforms to similar or more expansive liability in the united states government authorities elected officials and political candidates have called for amendments to section 230 of the communications decency act that would purport to limit or remove protections afforded interactive computer service providers proposed legislation includes the earn it act the pact act the bad ads act the safe tech act and others if these proposed laws are passed or if future legislation or governmental action is proposed or taken to address concerns regarding such harms changes could be required to our products that could restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business generally or cause users to abandon our products see “risk factors—risks relating to our business—inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our business” 

our global businesses are subject to a variety of complex and continuously evolving income and other tax frameworks for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” is revising its recommendations on how to tax international businesses including expanding the jurisdiction of member countries to tax businesses based on some level of digital presence and subjecting these companies to a minimum tax also the european commission as well as several countries both inside and outside the eu have recently adopted or considered proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed including proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue 

as the provider of dating products with a subscriptionbased element we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain us states and other countries that apply to our automaticallyrenewing subscription payment models for example the eu’s payment services directive psd2 which became effective in 2018 could impact our ability to process autorenewal payments or offer promotional or differentiated pricing for users in the eu similar legislation or regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation governing subscription payments are being considered in many us states 

finally certain us states and certain countries in the middle east and asia have laws that specifically govern dating services 

human talent 

our people are critical to match group’s continued success and we work hard to attract retain and motivate qualified talent as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1880 fulltime and approximately 20 parttime employees which represents a 15 yearoveryear increase in employee headcount we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions such as software engineers in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy safety and data security initiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth we may also increase headcount through the completion of 

merger and acquisition transactions including the acquisition of hyperconnect inc announced in february 2021 which pending regulatory approvals is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021 and would increase our headcount by approximately 400 employees based primarily in south korea as of december 31 2020 approximately 68 1 20 and 11 of our employees reside in the north america latin america emea and asiapacific regions respectively spanning 22 countries and reflecting various cultures backgrounds ages sexes gender identities sexual orientations and ethnicities our global workforce is highly educated with the majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles that are central to the technological and product innovations that drive our business competition for qualified talent has historically been intense particularly for software engineers and other technical staff

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

the dating industry is competitive with low switching costs and a consistent stream of new products and entrants and innovation by our competitors may disrupt our business 

the dating industry is competitive with a consistent stream of new products and entrants some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical regions user demographics or other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future these advantages could enable these competitors to offer products that are more appealing to users and potential users than our products or to respond more quickly andor costeffectively than us to new or changing opportunities 

in addition within the dating industry generally costs for consumers to switch between products are low and consumers have a propensity to try new approaches to connecting with people and to use multiple dating products at the same time as a result new products entrants and business models are likely to continue to emerge it is possible that a new product could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands through harnessing a new technology or a new or existing distribution channel creating a new or different approach to connecting people or some other means 

potential competitors include larger companies that could devote greater resources to the promotion or marketing of their products and services take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their products and services more quickly than we do potential competitors also include established social media companies that may develop products features or services that may compete with ours or operators of mobile operating systems and app stores for example facebook has introduced a dating feature on its platform which it has rolled out in north america and other markets and has stated it plans to roll out globally these social media and mobile platform competitors could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets and ready access to existing large pools of potential users and personal information regarding those users to gain competitive advantages over us including by offering different product features or services that users may prefer or offering their products and services to users at no charge which may enable them to acquire and engage users at the expense of our user growth or engagement 

if we are not able to compete effectively against our current or future competitors and products that may emerge the size and level of engagement of our user base may decrease which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the limited operating history of our newer brands and products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

we seek to tailor each of our brands and products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users building a given brand or product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures although certain of our newer brands and products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time the historical growth rates of these brands and products may not be an indication of future growth rates for such products or our newer brands and products generally we have encountered and may continue to encounter risks and difficulties as we build our newer brands and products the failure to successfully scale these brands and products and address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth and profitability rely in part on our ability to attract and retain users through costeffective marketing efforts any failure in these efforts could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

attracting and retaining users for our products involve considerable expenditures for online and offline marketing historically we have had to increase our marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and sustain our growth 

evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities for example as traditional television viewership declines and as consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers the reach of many of our traditional advertising channels continues to contract similarly as consumers communicate less via email and more via text messaging messaging apps and other virtual means 

the reach of email campaigns designed to attract new and repeat users and retain current users for our products is adversely impacted additionally changes proposed by large tech platforms such as apple and google to advertisers’ ability to access and use unique advertising identifiers cookies and other information to acquire potential users may adversely impact our advertising efforts to continue to reach potential users and grow our businesses we must identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels such as mobile and online video platforms generally the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels and methods continue to be less developed proven and precise making it more difficult to assess returns on investment associated with our advertising efforts and to costeffectively identify potential users there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry any failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the recent covid19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic including the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has reached across the globe resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures intended to control the spread of the virus including lockdowns closures quarantines and travel bans as well as changes in consumer behavior as individuals have become reluctant to engage in social activities with people outside their households while some of these measures have been relaxed in certain parts of the world ongoing and future prevention and mitigation measures as well as the potential for some of these measures to be reinstituted in the event of repeat waves of the virus are likely to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending and could materially adversely affect demand or users’ ability to pay for our products and services 

a public health epidemic including covid19 poses the risk that match group or its employees contractors vendors and other business partners may be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary course business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns necessitated for the health and wellbeing of our employees the employees of business partners or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities for example early on in the pandemic certain of our customer support vendors were impacted by government mandated shutdowns which adversely impacted the capability of the affected brands to respond timely and effectively to user inquiries and requests in addition in response to the covid19 outbreak we have taken several precautions that may adversely impact employee productivity such as continuing to allow employees to work remotely imposing travel restrictions and ongoing closures of office locations 

the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic pandemic or other health crisis on our business will depend on multiple factors that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including its severity location and duration and actions taken to contain or prevent further its spread additionally the covid19 pandemic could increase the magnitude of many of the other risks described in this annual report and have other adverse effects on our operations that we are not currently able to predict if our business and the markets in which we operate experience a prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions such as covid19 it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—trends affecting our business—impacts of the coronavirus” 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in various international markets including jurisdictions within the european union which we refer to as the “eu” and asia during periods of a strengthening us dollar our international revenues will be reduced when translated into us dollars in addition as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of our international revenues into us dollardenominated operating results affects the periodoverperiod comparability of such results and can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

the departure of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” has caused and may continue to cause volatility in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and the full impact of brexit remains uncertain see ‘‘item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—principles of financial reporting—effects of changes in foreign 

exchange rates on revenue“ and item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency exchange risk” 

distribution and marketing of and access to our products relies in significant part on a variety of thirdparty platforms in particular mobile app stores if these third parties limit prohibit or otherwise interfere with or change their policies in any material way it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we market and distribute our products including related mobile applications through a variety of thirdparty distribution channels including facebook which has rolled out its own dating product our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party certain platforms and channels have from time to time limited or prohibited advertisements for our products for a variety of reasons including poor behavior by other industry participants there is no assurance that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain marketing channels in the future if this were to happen with a significant marketing channel andor for a significant period of time our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally our mobile applications are almost exclusively accessed through the apple app store and google play store both apple and google have broad discretion to change their policies regarding their mobile operating systems and app stores in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute or market our applications through their stores our ability to update our applications including to make bug fixes or other feature updates or upgrades the features we provide our ability to access native functionality or other aspects of mobile devices and our ability to access information about our users that they collect to the extent either or both of them do so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected for example apple has indicated that in the future it will require app users to opt in before their identifier for advertisers “idfa” can be accessed by an app which is currently expected to come into effect in 2021 as a consequence the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns at the user level may become significantly limited and we and other app developers may experience increased cost per registration additionally apple and google are known to retaliate against app developers who publicly or privately challenge their app store rules and policies and such retaliation has and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our products will depend in part on our ability to access collect and use personal data about our users and subscribers 

we rely on the apple app store and google play store to distribute and monetize our mobile applications our users and subscribers engage with these platforms directly and may be subject to requirements regarding the use of their payment systems for various transactions as a result of this disintermediation these platforms receive and do not share with us key user data that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly if these platforms continue to or increasingly limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to access collect and use key user data our ability to identify and communicate with a meaningful portion of our user and subscriber bases may be adversely impacted if so our customer relationship management efforts our ability to reach new segments of our user and subscriber bases and the population generally the efficiency of our paid marketing efforts the rates we are able to charge advertisers seeking to reach users and subscribers on our various properties and our ability to identify and exclude users and subscribers whose access would violate applicable terms and conditions including underage individuals and bad actors may be negatively impacted and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as the distribution of our products through app stores increases in order to maintain our profit margins we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we rely on the apple app store and the google play store to distribute and monetize our mobile applications and related inapp products while our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features within these applications we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold however purchases of these subscriptions and features via our mobile applications are required to be processed through 

the inapp payment systems provided by apple and google due to these requirements we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions while we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods given the ever increasing distribution of our products through app stores and the strict mandates to use the inapp payments systems tied into apple’s and google’s app stores we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected google announced that it will require all developers to process all inapp purchases of subscriptions and features entirely through their inapp payment system beginning on september 30 2021 to date google has not enforced such a requirement but if google does so our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals across the globe with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across match group and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and on our ability to enhance expand and adapt these systems and infrastructures in a timely and costeffective manner 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis we have and may from time to time experience system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable and prevent our products from functioning properly for our users any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons further our systems and infrastructures are vulnerable to damage from fire power loss telecommunications failures acts of god and similar events while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations not all of our systems and infrastructures are fully redundant disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities and our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses that we may suffer any interruptions or outages regardless of the cause could negatively impact our users’ experiences with our products tarnish our brands’ reputations and decrease demand for our products any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experience of our users accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our various products ensure acceptable load times for our products and keep up with changes in technology and user preferences any failure to do so in a timely and costeffective manner could adversely affect our users’ experience with our various products and thereby negatively impact the demand for our products and could increase our costs either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced by third parties 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks and attempts to misappropriate customer information including personal user data credit card information and account login credentials while we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of our systems and infrastructure in related personnel and training and in employing a data minimization strategy where appropriate there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breaches in our systems or other such events from occurring some of our systems have experienced past security incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future any cyber or similar attack we are unable to protect ourselves against could damage our systems and infrastructure prevent us from providing our products tarnish our brand 

reputation result in the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information of our users andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties 

the impact of cyber or similar attacks experienced by third parties who provide services to us or otherwise process data on our behalf could have a similar effect on us moreover even cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect us or our third party service providers or data processors may result in widespread access to user account login credentials that such users have used across multiple internet sites including our sites or a loss of consumer confidence generally which could make users less likely to use or continue to use online products generally including our products the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on the integrity of thirdparty systems and infrastructure 

we rely on third parties primarily data center and cloudbased hosted web service providers such as amazon web services as well as third party computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers or any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers deterioration in the performance of these systems or cyber or similar attacks on these systems could impair our ability to provide our products or process transactions with our users which would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the security of personal and confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event and our reputation could be harmed 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential or sensitive information including credit card information and usertouser communications and enable our users to share their personal information with each other in some cases we engage third party service providers to store this information we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information but we have experienced past incidents and cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur in the future or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts when such events occur we may not be able to remedy them be required by law to notify regulators and individuals whose personal information was used or disclosed without authorization be subject to claims against us including government enforcement actions fines and litigation and have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such events including developing and implementing protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring when breaches of security or the security of our service providers occur the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures the security measures of our service providers and our reputation may be harmed we may lose current and potential users and the our various brands’ reputation and competitive positions may be tarnished any or all of which might adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and international laws and regulations including with respect to data privacy and platform liability these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in changes to our business practices increased cost of operations declines in user growth or engagement claims monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business see “item 1—business—government regulation” these us federal state and municipal and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and subject to change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from state to state and country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or other government actions may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products require changes to or cessation of 

certain business practices result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or modifications to existing business practices 

in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also adversely affect our business see “item 1—business—government regulation” to the extent such new or more stringent measures are required to be implemented impose new liability or limit or remove existing protections our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet or our services including laws or regulations that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access could decrease user demand for our service offerings and increase our cost of doing business for example in december 2017 the federal communications commission adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the united states including the repeal of specific rules against blocking throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by internet service providers to the extent internet service providers engage in such blocking throttling “paid prioritization” of content or similar actions as a result of this order and the adoption of similar laws or regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers when we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards in the case of a breach experienced by a third party the more sizable the third party’s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach to the extent our users are affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party such users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users and even if we could some users’ new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online or choose alternative payment methods that are less convenient or more costly for us or otherwise restrict our ability to process payments without significant user effort 

additionally if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions we may face litigation fines governmental enforcement action civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures significantly higher credit cardrelated costs and remediation costs or refusal by credit card processors to continue to process payments on our behalf any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations which in turn could adversely affect our business 

users of our products have been and may in the future be physically financially emotionally or otherwise harmed by other individuals that such users met or may meet through the use of one of our products when one or more of our users suffers or alleges to have suffered any such harm we have in the past and could in the future experience negative publicity or legal action that could damage our reputation and our brands similar events affecting users of our competitors’ products have in the past and could in the future result in negative publicity for the dating industry generally which could in turn negatively affect our business 

in addition the reputations of our brands may be adversely affected by the actions of our users that are deemed to be hostile offensive defamatory inappropriate untrue or unlawful while we have systems and processes in place that aim to monitor and review the appropriateness of the content accessible through our products and have adopted policies regarding illegal offensive or inappropriate use of our products our users have in the past and could in the future nonetheless engage in activities that violate our policies these safeguards may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation and brands especially if such hostile offensive or inappropriate use is wellpublicized 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition we also rely upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies and trade secrets relating to our products 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or sought in every country in which our products are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or registered even if available 

we generally seek to apply for patents or other similar statutory protections as and when we deem appropriate based on thencurrent facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization our existing trademarks patents or trade secrets may be determined to be invalid or unenforceable or laws and interpretations of laws regarding the enforceability of existing intellectual property rights may change over time in a manner that provides less protection the occurrence of any of these events could tarnish of our brands’ reputation limit our ability to market them or impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets and patents or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others for example in june 2020 we settled our longstanding litigation with bumble trading inc for patent and trademark infringement as well as trade secret misappropriation any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets including certain markets in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with certain of our international operations 

operating internationally particularly in countries in which we have limited experience exposes us to a number of risks in addition to those otherwise described in this annual report such as 

• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• differing levels of social and technological acceptance of our products or lack of acceptance of them generally 

• compliance challenges due to different laws and regulatory environments particularly in the case of privacy data security intermediary liability and consumer protection 

• competitive environments that favor local businesses or local knowledge of such environments 

• limitations on the level of intellectual property protection and 

• trade sanctions political unrest terrorism war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events such as covid19 

the occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect our international operations which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions 

we have made acquisitions in the past have recently announced a pending acquisition and continue to seek potential acquisition candidates we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with historical and future acquisitions if we are unable to 

• properly value prospective acquisitions especially those with limited operating histories 

• fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with acquired businesses 

• successfully integrate the operations and accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of the acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems 

• retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and 

• successfully support the acquired businesses in executing on strategic plans including expansion into geographies where we have presence and experience 

furthermore we may not be successful in addressing other challenges encountered in connection with our acquisitions and the anticipated benefits of one or more of our acquisitions may not be realized in addition such acquisitions can result in material diversion of management’s attention or other resources from our existing businesses the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are and from time to time may become subject to litigation and various legal proceedings including litigation and proceedings related to employment matters intellectual property matters privacy and consumer protection laws as well as stockholder derivative suits class action lawsuits and other matters that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is time consuming and expensive we evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate if possible the amount of potential losses based on these assessments and estimates we may establish reserves andor disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings as and when required or appropriate these assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment as a result actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 3—legal proceedings” 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness 

as of december 31 2020 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 39 billion and borrowing availability of 7498 million under our revolving credit facility 

our indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes 

• limiting our ability to use operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions or invest in other areas such as developing new brands products or exploiting business opportunities 

• restricting our business operations due to financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and certain of our subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness including certain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us and 

• exposing us to potential events of default if not cured or waived under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries’ debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

although the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures related to our senior notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the risks described above could increase 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 

our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

• our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control and 

• our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility the availability of which will depend on among other things our complying with the covenants in the thenexisting agreements governing our indebtedness 

there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 

variable rate indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur under our credit agreement will subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

we currently have 425 million of indebtedness outstanding under our term loan and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement borrowings under term loan are and any borrowings under 

the revolving credit facility will be at variable rates of interest indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk see “item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

exchange of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

we are obligated as a guarantor under the indentures relating to the exchangeable notes the exchange of some or all of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon exchange while the exchangeable note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilutive effect on our common stock upon any exchange andor offset any cash payment the issuers of the exchangeable notes would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of the exchanged notes the warrants have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling of our common stock by market participants because the exchange of the exchangeable notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated exchange of the exchangeable notes could depress the price of our common stock 

risks relating to the separation 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve through the separation 

we believe that the intended strategic and financial benefits of the separation should be achieved however there can be no assurance of this or that we will be able to attract transaction partners using our capital stock as acquisition currency and that analysts and investors will regard our new corporate structure as more clear and simple than our former corporate structure 

if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to fail to qualify as generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and our stockholders could suffer material adverse consequences 

following the completion of the separation and the merger of former match group into a whollyowned subsidiary “merger sub” of former iac the “merger” former match group’s successor became a whollyowned subsidiary of match group and most of former iac’s existing other subsidiaries came to be held under a separate public company former iac and iac received opinions from outside counsel that the separation and related transactions taken together and the merger were taxfree for us federal income tax purposes these opinions were based upon and rely on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations and undertakings of former iac former match group iac and match group including relating to the past and future conduct of former iac former match group iac and match group if any of these representations or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if any of the representations or covenants contained in any of the transactionrelated agreements or in any document relating to the opinions of counsel is or becomes inaccurate or is not complied with by former iac former match group iac match group or any of their respective subsidiaries the opinions of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of counsel regarding the transactions the us internal revenue service “irs” could determine that some or all of the transactions effected in connection with the separation should be treated as taxable for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinions of counsel were based are inaccurate or have not been complied with moreover even if the foregoing representations assumptions or undertakings are accurate and have been complied with the opinions of counsel merely represent the judgment of such counsel and are not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the transactions effected in connection with the separation do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such a challenge parties to the separation including match group could be subject to tax with respect to the separation 

for example if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” in general for us federal income tax purposes we would recognize a taxable gain as if the distribution of new iac stock in connection with the separation had been sold in a taxable sale for its fair market value even if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code taxable gain may be triggered under section 355e of the code if the transactions effected in connection with the separation were or later transactions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest by vote or value in us or iac for this purpose any acquisitions of i former iac stock or former match group stock before the separation or ii iac stock or match group stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after the separation are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or iac may be able to rebut that presumption 

in addition to potential tax liabilities relating to former match group we and our subsidiaries could be liable to satisfy any tax liabilities relating to former iac or iac with respect to the separation if their taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes were successfully challenged by the irs while in some cases iac may be obligated under the tax matters agreement to indemnify us for some or all of such taxes even in those cases there is no assurance that they will in fact indemnify us 

in addition if the merger were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we would be subject to tax on the transfer of the assets of former match to merger sub if we or our subsidiaries were required to pay taxes imposed on us with respect to the separation our cash flows would be adversely affected 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions following the separation 

we believe we will generally be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions however under current us federal income tax law a distribution that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the distributing corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of both the distributing corporation and the corporation the stock of which is distributed to preserve the taxfree treatment of the transactions effected in connection with the separation the tax matters agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the twoyear period following the separation except in specific circumstances we are generally restricted from 1 ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses 2 entering into certain transactions or series of transactions pursuant to which all or a portion of our shares of common stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 3 liquidating or merging or consolidating with any other person 4 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 5 repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain openmarket transactions or 6 taking or failing to take any other action that would cause the transactions effected in connection with the separation to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other hand 

certain of our directors and executive officers and directors of iac own both match group common stock and iac common stock this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when match group’s directors and iac’s executive officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for match group and iac for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between match group and iac regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between match group and iac thereafter potential conflicts of interest could also arise if match group and iac enter into any commercial arrangements in the future 

in addition joseph levin serves as the executive chairman of our board of directors while also serving as the chief executive officer and a director of iac glenn h schiffman serves as a director of match group while also serving as an executive officer of iac and alan g spoon serves as a director of each of match group and iac we believe that having a limited number of senior iac management members serve on our board for a 

transitional period will be beneficial to us however the fact that messrs levin schiffman and spoon hold positions with both match group and iac could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of them when facing decisions that may affect both match group and iac and each of them also faces conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between match group and iac 

our certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us 

our certificate of incorporation includes a “corporate opportunity” provision in which match group and its affiliates renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to any of match group’s directors or officers who are also officers or directors of iac 

generally match group’s officers or directors who are also iac’s officers or directors will not be liable to match group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty because such person fails to communicate or offer to match group a corporate opportunity that has been communicated or offered to iac that may also be a corporate opportunity of match group or because such person communicates or offers to iac any corporate opportunity that may also be a corporate opportunity of match group in order for any match group director or officer who is also an iac director or officer not to be liable to match group or its stockholders such opportunity cannot become known to the officer or director in his or her capacity as a match group director or officer and cannot be presented to any party other than iac in addition such officer or director cannot pursue such opportunity in his or her individual capacity the corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between match group and iac because the provision effectively permits any of match group’s directors or officers who also serve as an officer or director of iac to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of to match group 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

you may experience dilution due to the issuance of additional securities in the future  

our dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock restricted stock unit awards equity awards denominated in the equity of our nonpublic subsidiaries but settleable in shares of our common stock the exchangeable notes and the exchangeable note warrants 

these dilutive securities are reflected in our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 for more information see “note 10—earnings per share” to the consolidated financial statements included in “part ii item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” intraquarter movements in our stock price could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations 

we do not expect to declare any regular cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock instead we anticipate that all of our future earnings will be retained to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business we are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock consequently investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment investors seeking regular cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous including provisions which 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt 

• establish a classified board of directors as a result of which our board is divided into three classes with each class serving for staggered threeyear terms which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders 

• eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• provide that certain litigation against us can be brought only in delaware subject to certain exceptions and 

• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

none 




 item 2 properties 

match group believes that the facilities for its management and operations are generally adequate for its current and nearterm future needs match group’s facilities most of which are leased in various cities in the united states and abroad generally consist of executive and administrative offices and data centers we also believe that if we require additional space we will be able to lease additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

overview 

we are and from time to time may become involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities such as patent infringement claims trademark oppositions and consumer or advertising complaints as well as stockholder derivative actions class action lawsuits and other matters the amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage the litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the sec’s rules 

pursuant to the transaction agreement we have agreed to indemnify iac for matters relating to any business of former match group including indemnifying iac for costs related to the matters described below other than the matter described under the heading “newman derivative and stockholder class action regarding separation transaction”

trends affecting our business 

over the last several years we have seen significant changes in our business tinder has grown from incubation to the largest contributing brand in our portfolio and in 2020 our other brands also returned to growth in the aggregate this in turn has allowed us to invest in or acquire brands such as hinge and hawaya and incubate new brands such as chispa blk and upward where we see additional growth opportunities with our evolving portfolio of brands we have seen a number of significant trends in our business in recent years including the following 

lower cost users all of our brands rely on wordofmouth or free user acquisition to varying degrees wordofmouth acquisition is typically a function of scale with larger communities driving greater numbers of referrals youthfulness with the viral effect being more pronounced in younger populations due in part to a significantly higher concentration of single people in any given social circle and the increased adoption of social media and similar platforms among such populations and monetization rate with people generally more likely to talk openly about using dating products that are less heavily monetized additionally some but not all of our brands spend meaningfully on paid marketing accordingly the average amount we spend to acquire a user differs significantly across brands based in large part on each brand’s mix of paid and free acquisition channels as our mix has shifted toward younger users our mix of acquisition channels has shifted toward lower cost channels driving a decline over the past several years in the average amount we spend to acquire a new user across our portfolio as a percentage of revenue our costs of acquiring users have declined 

changing paid acquisition dynamics even as our acquisition of lower cost users increases paid acquisition of users remains an important driver of our business the channels through which we market our brands are always evolving but we are currently in a period of rapid change as tv and video consumption patterns evolve and internet consumption occurs regularly on mobile devices as we adapt our paid marketing activities to maximize user engagement with our brands we may increase our use of paid advertising at brands where we traditionally relied on wordofmouth engagement to leverage these shifts in media consumption patterns and fuel international growth other brands in our portfolio may reduce paid marketing activities to reflect the change in audience engagement 

inapp purchase fees purchases made by our customers through mobile applications as opposed to desktop or mobile web continue to increase purchases processed through the inapp payments systems provided by the apple app store and google play store are subject to inapp purchase fees which are generally 30 of the purchase price as a result the percentage of our revenues paid to apple and google continues to be a significant expense in 2019 tinder began offering subscribers an alternative payment method to google’s inapp payment system similar to the payment alternatives other brands in our portfolio have historically offered to subscribers through mobile apps on android google has announced that beginning in september 2021 all purchases will be required to be processed through the google play store and subject to inapp purchase fees to the extent that app stores fee change or the mix of our revenue generated through app stores shifts our results in particular our profit measures could be impacted 

increase in acceptance and growth of dating products globally over the past decade there has been meaningful growth in dating product usage in north america and western europe and we see the potential for similar growth in the rest of the world in the years ahead as more internetconnected singles utilize online dating products and the stigma around dating continues to erode we believe that there is potential for accelerating growth in the use of dating products globally 

impacts of the coronavirus when the novel coronavirus “covid19” first hit western europe and then certain major metropolitan centers in the us in the spring of 2020 particularly new york city engagement messages sent daily active users swipes® on tinder increased significantly but subscribers who purchase a subscription for the first time “firsttime subscribers” declined at most of our brands as meeting in person was restricted over the summer as users began to meet outdoors firsttime subscribers increased to above pre 

covid19 levels since the end of the summer the resurgence of covid19 lockdowns has once again negatively impacted firsttime subscriber trends though not as severely as in the spring of 2020 

other factors affecting the comparability of our results 

advertising spend our advertising spend which is included in our selling and marketing expense has consistently been one of our larger operating expenses how we deploy our advertising spend varies among brands with the majority of our advertising spend taking place online including search engines social media sites streaming services and influencers additionally some brands utilize television and outofhome marketing campaigns such as on outdoor billboards for established brands we seek to optimize for total return on advertising spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting spend to focus on marketing channels and markets that generate returns above our thresholds our datadriven approach provides us the flexibility to scale and optimize our advertising spend we spend advertising dollars against an expected lifetime value of a subscriber that is realized over a multiyear period and while this advertising spend is intended to be profitable on that basis it is nearly always negative during the period in which the expense is incurred for newer brands that are gaining scale or existing brands that are expanding into new geographies we may make incremental advertising investments to establish the brand before optimizing monetization of the brand in general our more established brands spend a higher proportion of their revenue on advertising while our newer brands spend a lower proportion and tend to rely more on word of mouth and other viral marketing additionally advertising spend is typically higher during the first quarter of our fiscal year and lower during the fourth quarter see “seasonality” below we increased our advertising spend as advertising rates declined during the covid19 outbreak 

seasonality historically our business has experienced seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results particularly with respect to our profit measurements this is driven primarily by a higher concentration of advertising spend in the first quarter when advertising prices tend to be the lowest and demand for our products tends to be highest and a lower concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter when advertising costs tend to be highest and demand for our products tends to be lowest seasonality is not consistent across our brands with brands targeted at older users generally showing more seasonality than brands targeted at younger users 

international markets our products are available across the world our international revenue represented 53 of our total revenue for both of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we vary our pricing to align with local market conditions and our international businesses typically earn revenue in local currencies as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results 

2020 consolidated results 

in 2020 revenue operating income and adjusted ebitda grew 17 16 and 15 respectively revenue growth was primarily due to strong growth at tinder and additional contributions from hinge pairs and plentyoffish the growth in operating income and adjusted ebitda was due to the higher revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the continued product mix shift toward brands with lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue operating income and adjusted ebtida were also impacted by an increase in cost of revenue expense primarily due to higher inapp purchase fees as a result of growing revenue sourced through mobile app stores increased web operation costs and live video costs

operating income and adjusted ebitda increased 16 to 1003 million and 15 to 1185 million respectively primarily as a result of the increase in revenue of 3400 million driven by growth at multiple brands and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue due to higher inapp purchase fees as revenue is increasingly sourced through mobile app stores increased web operation costs and live video costs 

at december 31 2020 there was 1425 million of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to all equitybased awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 23 years 

for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 

operating income and adjusted ebitda increased 17 to 960 million and 19 to 1263 million respectively primarily as a result of the increase in revenue of 3214 million and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the ongoing product mix shift toward brands with lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue due to higher inapp purchase fees and an increase in legal fees operating income was also impacted by higher stockbased compensation expense as a percentage of revenue and an increase in amortization due to the impairment of the match brand in the uk resulting in decreased growth compared to adjusted ebitda 

interest expense 



for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the 4125 senior notes on february 11 2020 and the issuance of the 4625 senior notes on may 19 2020 additionally the 2026 and 2030 senior exchangeable notes were outstanding for the entire year partially offsetting these increases were decreases due to the redemption of the 6375 senior notes during 2020 and a lower libor rate on the term loan 

for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 

interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the 5625 senior notes in february 2019 additionally the interest rate on the term loan which is based on libor was higher in 2019

income tax provision 



for discussion of income taxes see “note 3—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the company recorded an income tax provision of 329 million 82 million and 113 million respectively representing an effective tax rate of 6 2 and 2 respectively which is lower than the us statutory rate of 21 due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by i the exercise and vesting of stockbased awards and ii research credits in 2020 these benefits were partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credits 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was enacted to respond to economic challenges due to covid19 the cares act provided match group accelerated depreciation deductions and a relaxation of limitations on interest expense deductions both of which impact the timing of the realizability of our federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets the cares act did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 or our ability to recover our deferred tax assets

principles of financial reporting 

match group reports adjusted ebitda and revenue excluding foreign exchange effects both of which are supplemental measures to us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business on which our internal budget is based and by which management is compensated revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results these nongaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results match group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measures presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measures which we discuss below 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because they are noncash in nature adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses 

noncash expenses that are excluded from adjusted ebitda 

stockbased compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options restricted stock units “rsus” performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method however performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period to the extent that stockbased awards are settled on a net basis we remit the required taxwithholding amounts from our current funds 

depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions at the time of acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as customer lists trade names and technology are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to i acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of trade names and trademarks and ii goodwill which are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business 

the following table reconciles net earnings attributable to match group inc shareholders to operating income and adjusted ebitda 



effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on revenue 

the impact of foreign exchange rates on the company due to its global reach may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant since our results are reported in us dollars international revenue is favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies we believe the presentation of revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange in addition to reported revenue helps improve the ability to understand the company’s performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match group’s core operating results 

revenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates the percentage change in revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue is translated using prior period exchange rates 

the following tables presents the impact of foreign exchange on total revenue arpu and international arpu for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 and the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



 

a the company has excluded 418 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid for additional information on income taxes see “note 3—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data”

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than the items described above the company did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2020 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of match group’s accounting policies contained in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements 

acquisitions have been and will continue to be an important part of the company’s growth strategy the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 

in connection with certain business combinations in the past the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in “general and administrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is the company’s largest asset with a carrying value of 13 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 representing 43 and 15 respectively of the company’s total assets indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the company’s acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 2266 million and 2212 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value 

in performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment the company has the option under gaap to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment the company does not perform a quantitative test which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of october 1 if needed the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded the 2020 and 2019 annual assessments did not identify any impairments 

as a result of the separation the company had a negative carrying value for the company’s annual goodwill test at october 1 2020 additionally an impairment test of goodwill was not necessary because there were no factors identified that would indicate an impairment loss the company continued to have a negative carrying value at december 31 2020 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying values the company’s policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 in part because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent the company determines the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company’s trade names and trademarks the future cash flows are based on the company’s most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the company’s estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the company’s annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 10 to 23 in 2020 and 11 to 26 in 2019 and the royalty rates used ranged from 5 to 8 in 2020 and 3 to 8 in 2019 

if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment equal to the excess is recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized an impairment charge related to the match brand in the uk and the meetic brand in europe of 46 million during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized an impairment charge on the match brand in the uk of 66 million at december 31 2019 the aggregate indefinitelived intangible asset balance for which the estimate of fair value at that time was less than 110 of their carrying values was approximately 923 million at december 31 2020 no indefinitelived intangible asset balance had an estimated fair value less than 110 of carrying value 

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets consisting of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets was 1121 million and 1082 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

income taxes 

match group is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of asset and liabilities as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment 

a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative 

including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position such tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustment we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions the final outcome of these matters may vary significantly from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

as of december 31 2020 1581 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries generally our ability to distribute cash from these subsidiaries is limited to that subsidiary’s distributable reserves and after considering other corporate legal restrictions as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in the us in 2017 earnings in our foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the us without significant tax consequences 

stockbased compensation 

the company recorded stockbased compensation expense of 1023 million and 897 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

stockbased compensation at the company is complex due to our desire to attract retain and reward employees at many of our brands by allowing them to benefit from the value they help to create we also utilize equity awards as part of our acquisition strategy we accomplish these objectives in part by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our nonpublic subsidiaries as well as in match group inc we further refine this approach by tailoring the terms of equity awards as appropriate for example we issue certain equity awards with vesting conditioned on the achievement of specified performance targets such as revenue or profits these awards are referred to as performance awards in other cases we condition the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of value targets for a specific subsidiary or the company’s stock price these awards are referred to as marketbased awards 

the company issues restricted stock units “rsus” and performancebased stock units “psus” the value of rsus with vesting subject only to continued service is based on the fair value of match group common stock on the grant date the value of rsus that include a market condition is based on fair value estimated using a lattice model the value of rsus is expensed as stockbased compensation expense over the applicable vesting term for psu grants the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of match group common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s longterm debt 

at december 31 2020 the company’s outstanding longterm debt was 39 billion of which 35 billion consists of senior notes and exchangeable senior notes that bear interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the required payments on the fixedrate debt will exceed those on debt based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 1355 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period at december 31 2020 the 425 million term loan bore interest at a variable rate libor plus 175 at december 31 2020 the rate in effect was 196 if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense and payments on the term loan would increase or decrease respectively by 43 million based upon the outstanding balance and rate in effect at december 31 2020 

on february 13 2020 the credit facility and the term loan were amended to among other things provide for a benchmark replacement should the libor rate not be available in the future the rate used would be agreed to between the administrative agent and match group and may be based upon a secured overnight financing rate at the federal reserve bank of new york additional information about the benchmark replacement can be found amendment no 6 to the credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union “eu” and asia we are exposed to foreign exchange risk for primarily the euro and british pound “gbp” 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 international revenue accounted for 53 53 and 50 respectively of our consolidated revenue we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions carried out in a currency other than the us dollar and investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results the average gbp and euro exchange rates strengthened against the us dollar by 1 and 2 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 foreign currency exchange rate changes during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted revenue by 64 million and 475 million respectively or less than 1 and 2 of total revenue respectively see “principles of financial reporting” in “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for the definition of revenue excluding foreign exchange effects and a reconciliation of revenue to revenue excluding foreign exchange effects 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses included in the company’s earnings for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are losses and gains of 06 million 09 million and 53 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange gains or losses historically have not been material to the company as a result we have not historically hedged any foreign currency exposures the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies could adversely affect our future results of operations

tinder tinder was launched in 2012 and has since risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the online dating category growing to over 59 million subscribers as of the quarter ended december 31 2019 tinder’s distinctive swipe feature has led to significant adoption particularly among the millennial and younger generations which were previously underserved by the online dating category tinder employs a freemium model through which users can enjoy many of the core features of tinder for free including limited use of the swipe right ® feature with unlimited communication with other users however to enjoy premium features such as unlimited use of the swipe right feature a tinder user must subscribe to either tinder plus ®  launched in early 2015 or tinder gold tm  which was launched in late summer 2017 tinder users and subscribers may also pay for certain premium features such as super likes tm and boosts on a payperuse or à la carte basis

revenue 

match group direct revenue is primarily derived from users in the form of recurring subscriptions with the balance derived from nonrecurring fees paid for à la carte features in addition to direct revenue generated by users match group also generates indirect revenue from advertising 

marketing 

certain of our brands attract the majority of their users through wordofmouth and other free channels our other brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of social media advertising banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns video advertising business development or partnership deals creating content and hiring influencers to promote our dating products our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts 

competition 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products 

in addition to other online dating brands we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services such as in‑person matchmakers arguably our biggest competition comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 



• our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies and 

• the design and functionality of our dating products 

lastly since a large portion of dating customers use multiple products over a given period of time either concurrently or sequentially we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage

competition 

vimeo competes with a variety of online video platforms from free adbased video sharing services directed at users to niche workflow and distribution solutions directed at professionals and enterprises we believe that vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by providing an adfree high quality user experience and onestop professional solution that is easy to use and affordable 

we believe that vimeo’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors

revenue 

desktop revenue largely consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites the substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by the desktop business is supplied by google inc “google” pursuant to a services agreement with google 

pursuant to this agreement desktop businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our desktop business and then clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us see “item 1arisk factorswe depend upon arrangements with google” 

to a lesser extent desktop revenue also includes fees related to subscriptionbased downloadable desktop applications as well as display advertisements 

mosaic group revenue consists primarily of fees related to subscription downloadable mobile applications distributed through the apple app store and google play store and to a significantly lesser extent revenue generated from display advertisements 

marketing 

we market our desktop applications to users primarily through digital display advertisements and paid search engine marketing efforts as well as through a number of affiliate advertisers we market our mobile applications to users primarily through digital storefronts primarily the apple app store and google play store and digital display advertisements on social media messaging and media platforms as well as inapp and crossapp advertising 

competition 

the applications industry is competitive and has no single dominant desktop or mobile application brand globally the desktop business competes with a number of other companies that develop and market similar desktop browser application products and distribute them through direct to consumer and thirdparty agreements we also compete with search engines to provide users with new tab homepage andor default search services we believe that the ability of our desktop business to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

mosaic group competes with many mobile application companies that provide similar free and paid mobile application products we also compete with services provided by nonmobile analog and disparate sources along with certain digital companies whose competitive products are ancillary or immaterial to their primary sources of revenue 

we believe that the ability of mosaic group to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors 

 

• its ability to operate its various mobile applications as a scalable platform 

• its ability to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers in a costeffective manner 

 

• its ability to continue to optimize its marketing and monetization strategies 

• the continued growth of smartphone adoption in certain regions of the world particularly emerging markets 

• the continued strength of mosaic group brands and

risk factors 

risks related to our business and operations 

our success depends in substantial part on our continued ability to market distribute and monetize our products and services through search engines digital app stores and social media platforms 

the marketing distribution and monetization of our products and services depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with search engines digital app stores and social media platforms in particular those operated by google apple and facebook these platforms could decide not to market and distribute some or all of our products and services change their terms and conditions of use at any time and without notice favor their own products and services over ours andor significantly increase their fees while we expect to maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with these platforms no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so in the case of one or more of these platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in particular as consumers increasingly access our products and services through applications both mobile and desktop we primarily in the case of our match group and mosaic group businesses increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile and desktop browser applications both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications including those relating to the amount of and requirement to pay certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by apple and google through our mobile applications their ability to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute applications through their stores the features we may provide in our products and services our ability to access information about our subscribers and users that they collect and the manner in which we market inapp products apple or google could also make changes to their operating systems or payment services that could negatively affect our businesses we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our applications the features we provide in our products and services our ability to access information about our subscribers and users that they collect and the manner in which we market our inapp products to the extent either or both of them do so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition the use of certain of our products and services also depends in part on social media platforms for example many users of match group’s tinder hinge and certain other dating products historically registered for and logged into these dating products exclusively through their facebook profiles while match group launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for and log into tinder hinge and other affected products using their mobile phone number no assurances can be provided that users will no longer register for and log into these products through their facebook profiles facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the data collected by its platform and the use of such data and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook as an authentication method or to allow facebook to use such data to gain a competitive advantage if any such event were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon the continued migration of certain markets and industries online and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services 

through our various businesses we provide a variety of online products and services that continue to compete with their traditional offline counterparts we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend to a large extent on the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online 

for example the success of the businesses within our match group segment depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the dating market online our ability to continue to provide dating products that users find more efficient effective comfortable and convenient relative to traditional means of meeting people and the continued erosion of stigma surrounding online dating particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world if for any reason the dating market does not continue to migrate online as quickly as or at lower levels than we expect andor a meaningful number of users do not embrace our dating products andor return to offline dating products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

similarly the success of the businesses within our angi homeservices segment and our carecom business depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the home services and carerelated services markets online if for any reason these markets do not migrate online as quickly as or at lower levels than we expect and consumers and service professionals and members and caregivers continue in large part to rely on traditional offline efforts to connect with one another our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly as it relates to our advertisingsupported businesses our success also depends in part on our ability to compete for a share of available advertising expenditures as more traditional offline and emerging media companies continue to enter the online advertising market as well as on the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally if for any reason online advertising is not perceived as effective relative to traditional advertising and related mobile and other advertising models are not accepted web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace andor the industry fails to effectively manage click fraud the market for online advertising will be negatively impacted any lack of growth in the market for online advertising could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

marketing efforts designed to drive visitors to our various brands and businesses may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google and to a lesser extent microsoft and yahoo online display advertising and traditional offline advertising including television and radio campaigns in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective historically we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and convert consumers retain users and sustain our growth 

our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant thirdparty seller publisher of advertising including search engines and social media platforms with extraordinarily high levels of traffic and numbers of users or marketing affiliate as a result we cannot assure you that these parties will not limit or prohibit us from purchasing certain types of advertising including the purchase by iac of advertising with preferential placement advertising certain of our products and services andor using one or more current or prospective marketing channels in the future if a significant marketing channel took such an action generally for a significant period of time andor on a recurring basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if we fail to comply with the policies of thirdparty sellers publishers of advertising andor marketing affiliates our advertisements could be removed without notice andor our accounts could be suspended or terminated any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by search engines without advance notice could adversely affect both our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic such changes could adversely affect paid listings both their placement and pricing as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within search results any or all of which could increase our costs particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and adversely affect the effectiveness of our marketing efforts overall 

evolving consumer behavior specifically increased consumption of media through digital means can also affect the availability of costeffective marketing opportunities to continue to reach consumers engage with users and grow in this environment we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels such as online video and other digital platforms as well as target consumers and users via these channels since newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels such as television it could be difficult to assess returns on our related marketing investments which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly certain of our businesses also enter into various arrangements with third parties including advertising agencies to drive visitors to our various brands and businesses which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if these businesses are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the quality and convertibility of traffic and leads generated through thirdparty arrangements are dependent on many factors most of which are outside our control if the quality andor convertibility of traffic and leads do not meet the expectations of the users of our various products and services our paid listings providers andor advertisers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our brands and businesses operate in especially competitive and evolving industries 

the industries in which our brands and businesses operate are competitive with a consistent and growing stream of new products and entrants some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas user demographics andor other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future generally and particularly in the case of the businesses within our match group and angi homeservices segments we compete with social media platforms with access to large existing pools of potential users and their personal information which means these platforms can drive visitors to their products and services as well as better tailor products and service to individual users at little to no cost relative to our efforts for example our dating business competes with facebook which introduced a dating feature on its platform that it has rolled out in north america and certain other markets and has stated it plans to roll out globally we also compete generally with search engine providers and online marketplaces that can market their products and services online in a more prominent and costeffective manner than we can any of these advantages could enable our competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers than our products and services respond more quickly andor cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends andor display their own integrated or related products and services in a more prominent manner than our products and services in search results which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition costs to switch among products and services are low or nonexistent and consumers generally have a propensity to try new products and services and use multiple products and services simultaneously as a result we expect the continued emergence of new products and services entrants and business models in the various industries in which our brands and businesses operate our inability to compete effectively against new products services and competitors could result in decreases in the size and levels of engagement of our various user and subscriber bases which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our various properties certain operators of search engines offer products and services that compete directly with our products and services if links to websites offering our products and services are not displayed prominently in search results traffic to our properties could decline and our business could be adversely affected 

in addition to paid marketing we rely heavily on internet search engines such as google to drive traffic to our properties through their unpaid search results although search results have allowed us to attract a large audience with low organic traffic acquisition costs in the past if they fail to continue to drive sufficient traffic to our properties we may need to increase our marketing spend to acquire additional traffic we cannot assure you that the value we ultimately derive from any such additional traffic would exceed the cost of acquisition and any increase in marketing expense may in turn harm our operating results 

the amount of traffic we attract from search engines is due in large part to how and where information from and links to websites offering our products and services are displayed on search engine results pages the display including rankings of unpaid search results can be affected by a number of factors many of which are not in our direct control and may change frequently search engines have made changes in the past to their ranking algorithms methodologies and design layouts that have reduced the prominence of links to websites offering our products and services and negatively impacted traffic to such websites and we expect that search engines will continue to make such changes from time to time in the future 

however we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence actions of this nature taken by search engines with respect to search results in particular even when search engines announce the details of their methodologies their parameters may change from time to time be poorly defined or be inconsistently interpreted 

in addition in some instances search engines may change their displays or rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors any such action could negatively impact the search rankings of links to websites offering our products and services or the prominence with which such links appear in search results our success depends on the ability of our products and services to maintain a prominent position in search results and in the event operators of search engines promote their own competing products in the future in a manner that 

has the effect of reducing the prominence or ranking of our products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal and recognition within their respective markets and industries as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in large part on our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our emerging brands events that could adversely impact our brands and brandbuilding efforts include among others product and service quality concerns consumer complaints and lawsuits ineffective advertising inappropriate andor unlawful actions taken by users service professionals and caregivers actions taken by governmental or regulatory authorities data protection and security breaches and related bad publicity the occurrence or any of these events could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices 

as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile and other digital devices including through digital voice assistants we will need to continue to devote significant time and resources to ensure that our products and services are accessible across these platforms and multiple platforms generally if we do not keep pace with evolving online market and industry trends including the introduction of new and enhanced digital devices and changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally offer new andor enhanced products and services in response to such trends that resonate with consumers monetize products and services for mobile and other digital devices as effectively as our traditional products and services andor maintain related systems technology and infrastructure in an efficient and costeffective manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition the success of our mobile and other digital products and services depends on their interoperability with various thirdparty operating systems technology infrastructure and standards over which we have no control any changes to any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our mobile and digital products and services could adversely affect their usage levels andor our ability to attract consumers and advertisers which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our brands and businesses are sensitive to general economic events or trends particularly those that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to online advertising primarily revenue from our dotdash and applications segments and our ask media group business accordingly events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures andor levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the businesses within our angi homeservices segment are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects andor service professionals being less likely to pay for consumer matches and marketplace subscriptions which could result in decreases in marketplace service requests and directory searches any such decreases could result in turnover at the marketplace andor in any of our directories adversely impact the number and quality of service professionals at the marketplace and in our directories andor adversely impact the reach of and breath of services offered through the marketplace and our directories any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to communicate with our users subscribers and consumers via email or other sufficient means is critical to our success  

as consumers increasingly communicate via mobile and other digital devices and messaging and social media apps usage of email particularly among younger consumers has declined and we expect this trend to continue in addition deliverability and other restrictions could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to users subscribers and consumers a continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate with users subscribers and consumers via email could adversely impact the user experience engagement levels and conversion rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that any alternative means of communication for example push notifications and text messaging will be as effective as email has been historically 

our success depends in part on our ability to access collect and use personal data about our users and subscribers 

we depend on search engines digital app stores and social media platforms in particular those operated by google apple and facebook to market distribute and monetize our products and services our subscribers and users engage with these platforms directly and in the case of digital app stores may be subject to requirements regarding the use of their payment systems for various transactions as a result these platforms may receive personal data about our users and subscribers that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly certain of these platforms have restricted our access to personal data about our users and subscribers obtained through their platforms if these platforms limit or increasingly limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to access collect and use personal data about our users and subscribers that they have collected our ability to identify and communicate with a meaningful portion of our user and subscriber bases may be adversely impacted if so our customer relationship management efforts our ability to identify target and reach new segments of our user and subscriber bases and the population generally the efficiency of our paid marketing efforts the rates we are able to charge advertisers seeking to reach users and subscribers on our various properties and our ability to develop and implement safety features policies and procedures for certain of our products and services could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that search engines digital app stores and social media platforms upon which we rely will not limit or increasingly limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to access collect and use personal data about our users and subscribers that they have collected to the extent that any or all of them do so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may need to offset increasing digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally  

we increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute the mobile applications of our various businesses while some of our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores many of our mobile applications primarily our dating and mosaic group applications are subscriptionbased andor offer inapp à la carte features for a fee we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and à la carte features are sold however all related purchases must be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and to a lesser extent google as a result we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 and in the case of subscriptionbased products 30 for the first twelve months of a subscription and 15 thereafter of the revenue we receive from these transactions while we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods given the increasing distribution of our mobile applications through digital app stores and strict inapp payment system requirements we may need to offset these increased digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected additionally to the extent google changes its terms and conditions or practices to require us to process purchases of subscriptions and à la carte features through its inapp payment system our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part of the ability of angi homeservices and carecom to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals and caregivers 

we will need to continue to attract retain and grow the number of skilled and reliable service professionals who can provide home services across angi homeservices platforms and caregivers who can provide carerelated services across carecom platforms if we do not offer innovative products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals and members and caregivers generally as well provide service professionals and caregivers with an attractive return on their marketing and advertising investments the number of service professionals and caregivers affiliated with angi homeservices and carecom platforms respectively would decrease any such decrease would result in smaller and less diverse networks and directories of service professionals and caregivers and in turn decreases in service requests directory searches and member requests for caregivers which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon arrangements with google 

a meaningful portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to a services agreement with google pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our applications and ask media group properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services our current agreement with google expires on march 31 2020 in february 2019 we amended this agreement effective as of april 1 2020 to extend the expiration date of our agreement to march 31 2023 provided however that beginning september 2020 and each september thereafter we or google may after discussion with the other party terminate the services agreement effective on september 30 of the year 

following the year such notice is given we believe that the amended agreement taken as a whole is comparable to our current agreement with google 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends on a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches performed on our properties and these judgments factor into the number of advertisements we can purchase changes to the amount google charges advertisers the efficiency of google’s paid listings network googles judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our properties or to the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings generally could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive from google and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we have experienced such changes in the past and such changes could come about in the future for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google in the past google has made changes to its policies under our services agreement as well as made industrywide changes to its policies and practices that have negatively impacted our desktop and ask media group businesses 

our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines for the use of google brands and services including the chrome browser and chrome web store these guidelines govern which of our products and applications may access google services or be distributed through its chrome web store and the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results across various thirdparty platforms and products including our properties our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices or impair the distribution of some of our products and services any of which could be costly to address or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations google has made changes in the past that have adversely affected our results of operations and may do so again in the future noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for certain of our applications and ask media group properties could if not cured result in the suspension of some or all google services to our properties or the websites of our thirdparty partners andor the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of our rights under the agreement including the failure to allow our products to access google services whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise andor the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate provider of paid listings or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 

we operate in various foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as a result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound “gbp” during the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 approximately 35 and 34 of our total revenues respectively were international revenues we translate international revenues into us dollardenominated results as a result as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects the periodoverperiod comparability of operating results we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses to the extent we or our subsidiaries conduct transactions in andor have assets andor liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the relevant entitys functional currency for details regarding exchange rates and foreign currency exchange gains and losses for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 see “item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency exchange risk” 

the exit from the european union by the united kingdom may cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide and the full impact of this event remains uncertain the exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in exchange rate and other market and economic volatility which could adversely affect our operating results 

we have not hedged foreign currency exposures historically given that related gains or losses were not material to the company as we continue to grow and expand our international operations our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations will increase and if significant could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems technology and infrastructure from cyberattacks and cyberattacks experienced by third parties may adversely affect us 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technologyrelated events such as the use of botnets malware or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks phishing attempts to misappropriate user information and account login credentials and other similar malicious activities the incidence of events of this nature or any combination thereof is on the rise worldwide while we continuously develop and maintain systems designed to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our systems technology infrastructure products services and users have invested and continue to invest heavily in these efforts and related personnel and training and deploy data minimization strategies where appropriate these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite these efforts some of our systems have experienced past security incidents none of which had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and we could experience significant events of this nature in the future 

any event of this nature that we experience could damage our systems technology and infrastructure andor those of our users prevent us from providing our products and services compromise the integrity of our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities fines andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties even if we do not experience such events firsthand the impact of any such events experienced by third parties could have a similar effect we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events if we or any thirdparty with whom we do business or otherwise rely upon experiences an event of this nature our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if personal confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate and our reputation could be harmed 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal confidential or sensitive user information and in the case of certain of our products and services enable users to share their personal information with each other while we continuously develop and maintain systems designed to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information when such events occur we may not be able to remedy them we may be required by law to notify regulators and impacted individuals and it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such events and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring when breaches of security ours or that of any thirdparty we engage to store information occur we could face governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation including consumer class actions and the reputation of our brands and business could be harmed any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if any of the search engines digital app store or social media platform through which we market distribute and monetize our products and services were to experience a breach third parties could gain unauthorized access to personal data about our users and subscribers which could indirectly harm the reputation of our brands and businesses and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see also “the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs” 

credit card data security breaches or fraud that we or third parties experience could adversely affect us 

certain of our businesses accept payment including recurring payments via credit and debit cards and certain online payment service providers the ability of these businesses to access payment information on a real time‑basis without having to proactively reach out to users to process payments is critical to our success 

when we or a third party including credit card processing companies as well as any business that offers products and services online or offline generally experience a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their cards in the case of a breach experienced by a thirdparty the more sizable the thirdparty’s customer base the greater the number of accounts impacted and the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach if such a breach impacts our users we would need to contact affected users to obtain new payment information it is likely that we would not be able to reach all users impacted by the breach and even if we could new payment information for some users 

may not be obtained and pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of providers of online products and services to protect their personal information generally as a result they may stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for iac or restricts our ability to process payments without significant effort which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to prevent credit card data security breaches and fraudulent credit card transaction we could face litigation governmental enforcement actions fines civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures higher credit cardrelated costs and substantial remediation costs or credit card processors could cease doing business with ut any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data in connection with the provision of online products and services the processing of search queries and the display of advertising on our various properties the manner in which we share store use disclose and protect this information is determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses as well as federal state and foreign laws and regulations and evolving industry standards and practices which are changing and in some cases inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations in addition new laws regulations standards and practices of this nature are proposed and adopted from time to time 

for example a comprehensive european union privacy and data protection reform the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” became effective in may 2018 the gdpr which applies to companies that are organized in the european union or otherwise provide services to or monitor consumers who reside in the european union imposes significant penalties monetary and otherwise for noncompliance as well as provides a private right of action for individual claimants the gdpr will continue to be interpreted by european union data protection regulators which may require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional risks and liabilities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communications directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies 

in addition in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area the “eea” to the united states although us and european union authorities reached a political agreement for the transfer of personal data from the eea to the united states in february 2016 the “euus privacy shield” it is facing mounting legal challenges certain of our businesses continue to rely on the euus privacy shield and it is unclear what effect these challenges will have on transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states in reliance on this framework going forward if these businesses can no longer rely on the euus privacy shield in connection with the transfer of personal data from the eea to the united states they would need to make changes to their respective business practices to ensure compliance with the gdpr which could be costly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

also the exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the united kingdom at the same time many jurisdictions abroad in which we do business have already or are currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

moreover multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are being considered by the us congress and various us state legislatures including those in illinois new york virginia and washington other us state legislatures have already enacted privacy legislation one of the strictest and most comprehensive of which is the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which became effective january 1 2020 the “ccpa” the ccpa provides new data privacy rights for california consumers including the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and how it is being used as well as significant rights over the use of their personal information including the right to have such information deleted and the right to object to the sale of such information and new operational requirements for businesses primarily providing consumers with enhanced privacyrelated disclosures the ccpa restricts the ability of our businesses to use personal california user and subscriber information in connection with our various products services and operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ccpa also provides 

consumers with a private right of action for security breaches as well as provides for statutory damages of up to 750 per violation with the california attorney general maintaining authority to enforce the ccpa and seek civil penalties for intentional violations of the ccpa of up to 7500 per violation in addition a ballot initiative to address privacy matters has been filed with the office of the california attorney general which is expected to be presented california voters in november 2020 could further restrict the ability of our businesses to use personal california user and subscriber information in connection with our various products services and operations andor impose additional operational requirements on our businesses which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations lastly the federal trade commission has also increased its focus on privacy and data security practices as evidenced by the firstofitskind 5 billion dollar fine against a social media platform for privacy violations 

while we believe that we comply with applicable privacy and data protection policies laws and regulations and industry standards and practices in all material respects we could still be subject to claims of noncompliance that we may not be able to successfully defend andor significant fines and penalties moreover any noncompliance or perceived noncompliance by us or any thirdparty we engage to store or process information or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or use or transmission of personal information could result in a variety of claims against us including governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation including consumer class actions claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity when such events occur our reputation could be harmed and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additionally to the extent multiple us statelevel or european union memberstate level laws are introduced with inconsistent or conflicting standards and there is no federal or european union regulation to preempt such laws compliance could be even more difficult to achieve and our potential exposure to the risks discussed above could increase 

lastly ongoing compliance with existing and compliance with future privacy and data protection laws worldwide could be costly the devotion of significant costs to compliance versus to the development of products and services could result in delays in the development of new products and services us ceasing to provide problematic products and services in existing jurisdictions and us being prevented from introducing products and services in new and existing jurisdictions any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on the integrity quality efficiency and scalability of our systems technology and infrastructure and those of third parties 

we rely on our systems technology and infrastructure to perform well on a consistent basis from time to time in the past we have experienced and in the future we may experience occasional interruptions that make some or all of this framework and related information unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons we also rely on thirdparty data center service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers as well as thirdparty computer systems and a variety of communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain payment and other transactions with users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

the framework described could be damaged or interrupted at any time due to fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions any event of this nature could prevent us from providing our products and services at all or result in the provision of our products on a delayed or interrupted basis andor result in the loss of critical data while we and the third parties upon whom we rely have certain backup systems in place for certain aspects of our respective frameworks none of our frameworks are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption when such damages interruptions or outages occur our reputation could be harmed and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our framework to improve the consumer experience accommodate substantial increases in the number of visitors to our various platforms ensure acceptable load times for our various products and services and keep up with changes in user preferences if we do not do so in a timely and costeffective manner the user experience and demand across our brands and businesses could be adversely affected which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

mr diller and certain members of his family are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of the date of this report mr diller his spouse diane von furstenberg and his stepson alexander von furstenberg collectively beneficially owned shares of class b common stock and common stock that represented approximately 425 of the total outstanding voting power of iac based on the number of shares of iac common stock outstanding on january 31 2020 for details regarding the iac securities beneficially owned by mr diller ms von furstenberg and mr von furstenberg see “item 1businessequity ownership and vote” 

as a result of shares of class b common stock and common stock beneficially owned by these individuals they are collectively currently in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac and its shareholders which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals worldwide particularly in the case of senior management competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and we must attract new and retain existing employees to compete effectively while we have established programs to attract new and retain existing employees we may not be able to attract new or retain existing key and other employees in the future in addition if we do not ensure the effective transfer of knowledge to successors and smooth transitions particularly in the case of senior management across our various businesses our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

we may experience risks related to acquisitions 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms our growth could be adversely affected 

even if we complete what we believe to be suitable acquisitions we may experience related operational and financial risks as a result to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

• properly value prospective acquisitions especially those with limited operating histories 

 

• successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses 

• retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and 

• successfully manage acquisition‑related strain on management operations and financial resources 

we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions including the pending acquisition of carecom in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions including any that iac expects to realize as a result of the acquisition of carecom may not be realized also future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities andor the assumption of contingent liabilities lastly the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face additional risks in connection with our international operations 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks including 

• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance language barriers and cultural differences 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• differing levels or lack of social and technological acceptance of our products and services 

• slow or lagging growth in the commercial use and acceptance of the internet 

• foreign currency fluctuations 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds among countries and back to the united states and related repatriation costs 

• differing and potentially adverse tax laws 

 

• competitive environments that favor local businesses 

• limitations on the level of intellectual property protection and 

• trade sanctions political unrest terrorism war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events 

the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations our success in international markets will also depend in large part on our ability to successfully complete international acquisitions joint ventures or other transactions and integrate these businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business including among others broadband internet access online commerce advertising privacy and data protection intermediary liability consumer protection protection of minors taxation and securities compliance these domestic and foreign laws which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the internet industry and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as well as in a manner that could conflict with our current policies and practices we face the same issues in the case of amended proposed or new laws and regulations 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as responding to any related inquiries investigations or other government action could be costly delay or impede the development of new products and services require modifications to existing products and services require us to change or cease certain business practices andor require significant management time and attention noncompliance could subject us to remedies that could harm our business such as fines demands or orders that require us to modify or cease then current products and services as well as result in negative publicity any of which if significant could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the internet andor online products and services generally restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our products and services regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered internet access for example in february 2019 the secretary of state for digital culture media and sport of the united kingdom indicated in public comments that his office intends to inquire as to the measures utilized by online dating platforms including tinder to prevent access by underage users to the extent our dating business is required to implement new measures to prevent such access our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition in april 2019 the united kingdom published proposed legislation that would create a new regulatory body responsible for establishing duties of care for internet companies and for assessing related compliance as proposed failure to comply with the legislation could result in fines blocking of services and personal liability for senior management to the extent our businesses are required to implement new measures andor make changes to our products and services to ensure compliance our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected compliance with this legislation or similar or more stringent legislation in other jurisdictions could be costly and the failure to comply could result in service interruptions and negative publicity any or all of which could adversely affect our 

business financial condition and results of operations in addition in december 2017 the us federal communications commission the “fcc” adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the united states including the repeal of specific rules against blocking throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by internet service providers to the extent internet service providers take such actions our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of the businesses within our match group angi homeservices vimeo and applications segments as well as our carecom business we are also sensitive to the adoption of any law or regulation affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments for example the european union payment services directive which became effective in 2018 could impact the ability of our businesses to process autorenewal payments for as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing to users who reside in the european union and similar new and proposed changes to similar existing legislation or regulations are being considered in many us states the adoption of any law or regulation that adversely affects revenue from recurring membership or subscription payments could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are also generally sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws the european commission and several european countries have recently adopted or intend to adopt proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which certain of our european businesses are taxed including proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example france enacted a digital services tax in 2019 which is applicable to revenues over specified thresholds generated by businesses that provide intermediary services any digital interface that enables users to contact and interact with others to andor publish advertisingbased user data linked to users residing in france the proposal which is applicable retroactively to revenues earned from and after january 1 2019 would likely apply to certain of our businesses the united kingdom previously enacted a similar proposal the digital services tax which is applicable to revenues of social media platforms online marketplaces and search engines linked to users residing in the united kingdom and earned from and after april 1 2020 which would likely apply to certain of our businesses one or more of these or similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of our angi homeservices segment and to a lesser extent our carecom business we are particularly sensitive to the adoption of worker classification laws specifically laws that could effectively require us to change our classification of certain of our service professionals and caregivers from independent contractors to employees as well as changes to state and local laws or judicial decisions relating to the definition andor classification of independent contractors for example california recently passed a worker classification statute ab 5 which effectively narrowed the definition of an independent contractor by requiring hiring entities to use a stricter test to determine a given worker’s classification in addition ab 5 places the burden of proof for classifying workers as independent contractors on hiring entities and provides enforcement powers to the state and certain cities also legislative proposals concerning worker classification are being considered by various states including new york and new jersey since we currently treat certain of our service professionals and in limited cases our caregivers as independent contractors for all purposes we do not withhold federal state and local income or other employment related taxes make federal or state unemployment tax or federal insurance contributions act payments or provide workers’ compensation insurance with respect to such individuals if we are required as the result of new laws to reclassify these individuals as employees we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs including exposure for prior and future periods under federal state and local tax laws and workers’ compensation unemployment benefits labor and employment laws as well as potential liability for penalties and interest any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are involved in various legal proceedings and investigations challenging the classification of these individuals as independent contractors and may become involved in other proceedings and investigations in the future 

lastly in the case of the businesses within our vimeo segment we are also sensitive to the changes in laws and regulations that limit the liability of online intermediaries for copyright infringement by their users while the us digital millennium copyright act the “dmca” currently provides a safe harbor for online intermediates based primarily on the principles of notice and takedown if the dmca is interpreted in a manner unfavorable to online providers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition in june 2019 the european union passed the directive on copyright in the digital state market which requires each european union member state to adopt by june 2021 a regulatory framework that requires online intermediaries and copyright holders to use best efforts to license or takedown to infringing content to the extent this legislation or similar or more stringent legislation in the us or other jurisdictions abroad requires our businesses to implement new measures andor make changes to our products and services to ensure compliance which could be costly our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition as well as upon trade secrets we also rely to a lesser extent upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2037 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that these efforts will result in adequate trademark and service mark protection adequate domain name rights and protections the issuance of a patent or adequate patent protection against competitors and similar technologies third parties could also create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures challenges to our intellectual property rights could still arise third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization andor laws regarding the enforceability of existing intellectual property rights could change in an adverse manner the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing online using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business related to alleged claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others by us and users of certain of our products and services and may need to institute legal proceedings in the future to enforce protect or refine the scope of our intellectual property rights for example in march 2018 our match group business filed a lawsuit against bumble trading inc which operates and markets the online dating application bumble in the united states for patent and trademark infringement as well as trade secret misappropriation bumble’s counterclaims request that our trademark registration for tinder’s swipe trademark be canceled and that a number of our pending applications for trademark registration be denied this case is currently pending in federal court in the western district of texas any legal proceedings related to intellectual property regardless of outcome or merit could be costly and result in diversion of and technical resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our liquidity indebtedness and dilution 

our current and future indebtedness could affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 31 billion of which approximately 13 billion 16 billion and 2320 million was owed by iac match group and angi homeservices respectively as of that date we match group and angi homeservices had borrowing availability of 250 million 500 million and 250 million respectively under our revolving credit facilities neither match group angi homeservices nor any of their respective subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are currently subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness similarly neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries other than match group and its subsidiaries in the case of match group indebtedness and angi homeservices and its subsidiaries in the case of angi homeservices indebtedness guarantee any indebtedness of match group or angi homeservices nor are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness 

the terms of the indebtedness of iac match group and angi homeservices could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• limit our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business 

subject to certain restrictions we and our subsidiaries may incur additional unsecured and secured indebtedness if additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions is significant the risks described above could increase 

lastly if an event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds specified thresholds our ability to pay dividends make distributions and repurchase or redeem our capital stock would be limited match group and angi homeservices are subject to similar restrictions see “item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial position liquidity and capital resources and financial position” 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness 

the ability of iac match group and angi homeservices to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

 

 

neither we nor match group nor angi homeservices may be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our respective operations andor borrow under our respective revolving credit facilities in amounts sufficient to meet our scheduled debt obligations see also “we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries” below if so we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or seek additional capital in a manner that complies with the terms including certain restrictions and limitations of our current indebtedness if these efforts do not generate sufficient funds to meet our scheduled debt obligations we would need to seek additional financing andor negotiate with our lenders to restructure or refinance our indebtedness our ability to do so would depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any such financing restructuring or refinancing could be on less favorable terms than those governing our current indebtedness and would need to comply with the terms including certain restrictions and limitations of our existing indebtedness 

we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries 

potential sources of cash for iac include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of certain of our subsidiaries availability under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales including marketable securities while the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and applicable statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions generally in the case of match group and angi homeservices the terms of their indebtedness limit their ability to pay dividends or make distributions loans or advances to stockholders including iac in certain circumstances in addition because match group and angi homeservices are separate and distinct legal entities with public shareholders they have no obligation to provide us with funds 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2019 match group and angi homeservices had 425 million and 275 million respectively outstanding under their term loans and no amounts outstanding under their revolving credit facilities  borrowings under these loans are and any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities of iac match group or angi homeservices will be at 

variable interest rates which exposes us to interest rate risk for details regarding interest rates applicable to the variable rate indebtedness of match group and angi homeservices described above as of december 31 2019 and how certain increases and decreases in libor rate would affect related interest expense see “item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

you may experience dilution with respect to your investment in iac and iac may experience dilution with respect to its investments in match group and angi homeservices as a result of compensatory equity awards 

we have issued various compensatory equity awards including stock options stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of our common stock as well as in equity of our various consolidated subsidiaries including match group and angi homeservices for more information regarding these awards and their impact on our diluted earnings per share calculation see “note 11stockbased compensation and note 10earnings per share respectively to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8consolidated financial statements and supplementary data” 

the issuance of shares of iac common stock in settlement of these equity awards could dilute your ownership interest in iac awards denominated in shares of match group or angi homeservices common stock that are settled in shares of those subsidiaries could dilute iac’s ownership interest in match group and angi homeservices respectively the dilution of our ownership stakes in match group andor angi homeservices could impact our ability among other things to maintain match group andor angi homeservices as part of our consolidated tax group for us federal income tax purposes to effect a taxfree distribution of our match group andor angi homeservices stakes to our stockholders or to maintain control of match group andor angi homeservices as we generally have the right to maintain our levels of ownership in match group and angi homeservices to the extent match group or angi homeservices issues additional shares of their respective capital stock in the future pursuant to investor rights agreements we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur and we expect that the separation will be a taxfree distribution to our stockholders 

with respect to awards denominated in shares of our nonpublicly traded subsidiaries we estimate the dilutive impact of those awards based on our estimated fair value of those subsidiaries those estimates may change from time to time and the fair value determined in connection with vesting and liquidity events could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation 

risks relating to the separation 

for purposes of the risks relating to the separation below only references to i iac means iacinteractivecorp a delaware corporation as in existence prior to the completion of the separation ii match group refers to match group inc a delaware corporation as in existence prior to the completion of the separation iii new iac refers to iac holdings inc a delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of iac prior to the completion of separation and which will be referred to as iacinteractivecorp from and after the completion of the separation and iv new match means iac as in existence from and after the completion of the separation and which will be renamed match group inc 

the separation is subject to certain closing conditions that if not satisfied or waived will result in the separation not being completed which may cause the market price of iac and match group securities to decline 

the completion of the separation is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions including the receipt of certain approvals from the stockholders of iac and match group and the absence of material litigation some of the conditions to the completion of the separation are outside of the control of iac and match group if any condition to the closing of the separation is not satisfied or waived the separation will not be completed in addition iac and match group may terminate the transaction agreement in certain circumstances 

if the separation is not completed the market price of iac andor match group securities may fluctuate to the extent that then current market prices of those securities reflect a market assumption that the separation will be completed among other reasons based on historical activity any fluctuation in the market price of match group securities will likely result in a fluctuation in the market price of iac securities if the separation is not completed iac will have incurred significant costs including certain investment banking financing legal and accounting fees and related expenses and the diversion of management resources for which we will have received little or no benefit 

new iac and new match may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that they expect to result from the separation 

anticipated benefits that new iac and new match expect to result from the separation may be delayed or not be achieved at all for example there can be no assurances that despite enhanced management focus receipt of needed capital and 

simplification of its corporate structure new iac will succeed in building and scaling its remaining businesses and growing through acquisitions similarly there can be no assurances that new match will be able to take advantage of the improved strategic flexibility resulting from the elimination of a controlling shareholder and having a single class of one shareone vote common stock if these and other anticipated benefits are not achieved or delayed the business financial condition and results of operations of new iac andor new match could be adversely affected 

if certain aspects of the separation fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes new iac new match their respective stockholders could suffer material adverse consequences 

the completion of the separation is conditioned upon among other things the receipt of tax opinions from iacs outside counsel to the effect that certain aspects of the separation and related transactions will be taxfree for us federal income tax purposes 

these tax opinions will be based upon and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of iac match group and new iac including those relating to past and future conduct if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if any of the representations or covenants contained in any agreements and documents relating to the separation or in any document relating to such tax opinions are inaccurate or not complied with by iac match group or new iac the tax opinions may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

even if these tax opinions are valid no assurances can be provided that the us internal revenue service the irs will agree that certain aspects of the separation qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such a challenge new iac new match and their respective stockholders could suffer material adverse consequences 

even if certain aspects of the separation were otherwise to qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the separation could result in taxable gain to new match but not its stockholders under section 355e of the code if certain aspects of the separation were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest by vote or value in iac or after the completion of the separation new match or new iac within two years before or after the separation 

following the separation new iac and new match will be parties to a tax matters agreement pursuant to which among other things each of them will be responsible for certain tax liabilities and obligations following the separation under the tax matters agreement new iac generally will be responsible for and will indemnify new match against any liabilities incurred as a result of the failure of certain aspects of the separation to qualify for the intended taxfree treatment unless subject to certain exceptions the failure to so qualify is attributable to match group’s or after the separation new match’s actions or failure to act match group’s breach of certain representations or covenants or certain acquisitions of equity securities of new match in each case described in the tax matters agreement the amount of any such liability for which new iac or new match would be responsible may be significant and if incurred could have a material adverse effect on new iacs or new match’s as the case may be business financial condition and results of operations and therefore adversely affect the value of new iac common stock or new match common stock 

new iac and new match may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions following the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment of certain aspects of the separation the tax matters agreement will during the twoyear period following the separation impose certain restrictions on new iac and new match except in specific circumstances i ceasing to actively conduct certain of their respective businesses 2 entering into certain transactions or a series of transactions pursuant to which all or a portion of their outstanding capital stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise iii liquidating or merging or consolidating with any other person iv issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds v repurchasing shares of their outstanding capital stock other than in certain openmarket transactions or vi taking any other action that or failing to take any other action the failure of which would certain aspects of the separation together with certain related transactions to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these restrictions may limit the ability of new iac and new match to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that they may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of their respective stockholders or that might increase the value of their respective businesses also the potential responsibility of new iac and new match for liabilities arising from the failure of certain aspects of the separation to qualify for taxfree treatment or their indemnity obligations to each other for such liabilities under the tax matters agreement could discourage delay or prevent certain third parties from acquiring new iac or new match 

after the separation actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between new iac’s management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of new match on the other hand 

after the separation management and directors of new iac may own new iac and new match common stock this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when new iac directors and executive officers face decisions that could have different implications for new iac and new match for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of disputes regarding terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between new iac and new match following the separation potential conflicts of interest could also arise if new iac and new match were to enter into new commercial arrangements in the future 

in addition joseph levin initially will serve as the executive chairman of new match’s board of directors while also serving as the chief executive officer of new iac glenn h schiffman will initially serve as a director of new match while also serving as an executive officer of new iac and alan g spoon will serve as a director of both new iac and new match the fact that messrs levin schiffman and spoon will hold positions with both companies following the completion of the separation could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of them when facing decisions that may affect both companies and each of them may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between both companies

 management overview 

as used herein iac the company we our or us and similar terms refer to iacinteractivecorp and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise 

iac operates vimeo and dotdash among many other online businesses and also has majority ownership of both match group which includes tinder match plentyoffish okcupid and hinge and angi homeservices which includes homeadvisor angie’s list and handy 

on december 19 2019 iac entered into a transaction agreement the transaction agreement with mtch iac holdings inc a direct wholly owned subsidiary of iac new iac and valentine merger sub llc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of iac subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the transaction agreement the businesses of mtch will be separated from the remaining businesses of iac through a series of transactions that will result in the pretransaction stockholders of iac owning shares in two separate public companies—1 iac which will be renamed match group inc new match and which will own the businesses of mtch and certain iac financing subsidiaries and 2 new iac which will be renamed iacinteractivecorp and which will own iacs other businesses—and the pretransaction stockholders of 

mtch other than iac owning shares in new match completion of the separation which is expected to occur in midsecond quarter of 2020 is subject to a number of conditions including approval by a majority of the disinterested shareholders of mtch approval of iac’s shareholders and other customary conditions and approvals we refer to the full separation as the separation 

sources of revenue 

mtchs revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time revenue is also derived from à la carte features where users pay a nonrecurring fee for a specific action or event and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences 

angi revenue is primarily derived from i consumer connection revenue which comprises fees paid by homeadvisor service professionals for consumer matches regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service and fees from completed jobs sourced through the homeadvisor and handy platforms and ii homeadvisor service professional membership subscription fees consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors including the service requested product experience offered and geographic location of service revenue is also derived from i sales of timebased website mobile and call center advertising to service professionals ii membership subscription fees from consumers and iii service warranty subscription and other services prior to january 1 2020 handy recorded revenue on a net basis effective january 1 2020 we modified the handy terms and conditions so that handy rather than the service professional has the contractual relationship with the consumer to deliver the service and handy rather than the consumer has the contractual relationship with the service professional consumers request services and pay for such services directly through the handy platform and then handy fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade occupation andor business that customarily provides such services this change in contractual terms requires gross revenue accounting treatment effective january 1 2020 also in the case of certain tasks homeadvisor provides a prepriced product offering pursuant to which consumers can request services through a homeadvisor platform and pay for the services directly homeadvisor then fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade occupation andor business that customarily provides such services revenue from homeadvisor’s prepriced product offering is also recorded on a gross basis effective january 1 2020 in addition to changing the presentation of revenue to gross from net the timing of revenue recognition will change for prepriced jobs and will be later than the timing of existing consumer connection revenue for homeadvisor because we will not be able to record revenue generally until the service professional completes the job on our behalf 

vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly saas subscription fees paid by subscribers for selfserve and enterprise subscription plans 

dotdash revenue consists principally of display advertising revenue and performance marketing revenue display advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by our sales team and through programmatic advertising networks performance marketing revenue includes affiliate commerce and performance marketing commissions affiliate commerce commissions is generated when dotdash refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction performance marketing commissions are generated on a costperclick or costpernew account basis 

mosaic group revenue consists primarily of fees related to subscription downloadable mobile applications distributed through the apple app store and google play store as well as display advertisements 

revenue for the businesses within the emerging  other segment is generated primarily through advertising subscriptions and media production and distribution for periods prior to their sales dictionarycom revenue was derived principally from advertising and electus revenue was primarily generated through media production and distribution 

services agreement with google 

a meaningful portion of the companys revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google the services agreement in addition the company earns certain other advertising revenue from google that is not attributable to the services agreement for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  consolidated revenue earned from google was 7335 million and 8252 million  respectively representing 15 and 19  respectively of the companys consolidated revenue 

revenue attributable to the services agreement is earned by the desktop business within the applications segment and ask media group within the emerging  other segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 revenue earned 

from the services agreement was 2911 million and 4265 million  respectively within the applications segment and 3859 million and 3390 million  respectively within the emerging  other segment 

the current services agreement expires on march 31 2020 on february 11 2019 the company and google amended the services agreement effective as of april 1 2020 the amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to march 31 2023 provided that during september 2020 and during each september thereafter either party may after discussion with the other party terminate the services agreement effective on september 30 of the year following the year such notice is given the company believes that the amended agreement taken as a whole is comparable to the company’s currently existing agreement with google the services agreement requires that the company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice these updates may be specific to the services agreement or could be more general and thereby impact the company as well as other companies these policy and guideline updates could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations particularly our desktop business and ask media group as described below google has made changes to the policies under the services agreement and has also made industrywide changes that have negatively impacted the desktop business during both 2018 and 2019 

google’s policy changes related to its chrome browser which became effective on september 12 2018 negatively impacted the distribution of our b2c downloadable desktop products the resultant reduction in projected profits and revenues of this business resulted in a 277 million impairment of the b2c trade name which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 on may 31 2019 google announced industrywide policy changes which became effective on july 1 2019 related to all extensions distributed through the chrome web store these industrywide changes combined with other changes to polices under the services agreement during the second half of 2019 have had a negative impact on the historical and expected future results of operations of the desktop business as of december 31 2019 the goodwill balance of the desktop reporting unit and the carrying value of the related intangible asset are 2651 million and 289 million  respectively the fair values of the desktop reporting unit and the related intangible asset approximate their carrying values therefore a modest reduction in the fair values of the desktop reporting unit or the related intangible asset would result in an impairment charge which would be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of such assets 

distribution marketing and advertiser relationships 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of fees paid to apple and google related to the distribution and the facilitation of inapp purchases of product features and payments made to partners who direct traffic to our ask media group websites who distribute our businesstobusiness customized browserbased applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on thirdparty distribution channels such as google and other search engines and social media websites such as facebook in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own services and products as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

we market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses

principles of financial reporting 

iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of nongaap measure 

  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses 

the following table reconciles net earnings attributable to iac shareholders to operating income to consolidated adjusted ebitda 

for a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted ebitda for the companys reportable segments see  note 12—segment information  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  

noncash expenses that are excluded from our nongaap measure 

  stockbased compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period to the extent that stockbased awards are settled on a net basis the company remits the required taxwithholding amounts from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

  amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as technology service professional relationships customer lists and user base memberships trade names and content are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in  note 2—summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements 

acquisitions which are generally referred to in gaap as business combinations are an important part of the companys growth strategy the company invested 2057 million and 2433 million including the value of angi homeservices class a common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of handy in acquisitions in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill 

management makes two critical determinations at the time of an acquisition the reporting unit that will benefit from the acquisition and to which goodwill will be assigned and the allocation of the purchase price of the business to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values the reporting unit determination is important beyond the initial allocation of purchase price because future impairment assessments of goodwill as described below are performed at the reporting unit level historically when the company’s acquisitions have been complementary to existing reporting units for example the 2019 acquisition of magisto by vimeo and the 2018 acquisitions of handy by angi and teltech by mosaic group the goodwill is allocated to these reporting units acquisitions within the emerging  other reportable segment such as nursefly in 2019 and bluecrew in 2018 usually result in the creation of new reporting units because they are standalone businesses with unique product offerings management or target markets for example 

the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values is complex because of the judgments involved in determining these values the determination of purchase price and the fair value of monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically the least complex aspect of the company’s accounting for business combinations due to management’s experience and the inherently lower level of complexity due to the higher degree of complexity associated with the valuation of intangible assets the company usually obtains the assistance of outside valuation experts in the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired which can be both definitelived such as acquired technology customer and contractor relationships or indefinite lived such as acquired trade names and trademarks while outside valuation experts may be used management has ultimate responsibility for the valuation methods models and inputs used and the resulting purchase price allocation the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the business combination as of the acquisition date 

in connection with certain business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price the premise underlying the accounting for contingent consideration arrangements is that there are divergent views as to the acquired company’s valuation between the company and the selling shareholders of the acquiree therefore a model is developed with future payments of a portion of the purchase price linked to one or more financial eg revenue andor profit performance andor operating eg number of subscribers metrics that will be achieved over a specified time frame in the future based upon the performance of the business in keeping with the accounting guidance for business combinations each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and the fair value is included in the aggregate purchase price the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements the number of scenarios used is typically greater for longerterm arrangements the contingent consideration arrangements are reassessed and reflected at current fair values for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations significant changes in the specified forecasted financial or operating metrics can result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement which can result in volatility of general and administrative expense as the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are recorded 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value the carrying value of goodwill is 29 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 4465 million and 4581 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

in performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment the company has the option under gaap to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment the company does not perform a quantitative test which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of october 1 gaap provides a not allinclusive set of examples of macroeconomic industry market and company specific factors for entities to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments while the company also has the option under gaap to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying values the companys policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 in part because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent 

if the conclusion of our qualitative assessment is that there are indicators of impairment and a quantitative test is required the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the companys reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment equal to the excess is recorded 

the company’s annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment which is referred to as a component this reassessment of reporting units is also made each time the company changes its operating segments separate from the impact of the change in operating segments the company concluded that the applications operating segment should be split into two reporting units  desktop and mosaic group  effective october 1 2018 if the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly formed reporting units the allocation is usually made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values 

for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2019  a qualitative assessment of the mtch angi vimeo mosaic group included in the applications segment college humor media bluecrew and nursefly reporting units goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values the primary fact ors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below 

 for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2019 the company quantitatively tested the desktop reporting unit included in the applications segment the companys quantitative test indicated that there was no impairment the companys dotdash ask media group and the daily beast reporting units have no goodwill 

the aggregate goodwill balance for the desktop reporting unit for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 10 over its carrying value is approximately 2651 million  

the fair value of the companys reporting units except for mtch and angi described above is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its nonpublic subsidiary denominated stockbased compensation plans which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative test determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including the amount 

and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed based on each reporting units current results and forecasted future performance as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the companys reporting units was 125 in 2019 and ranged from 125 to 15 in 2018  determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer gr oup of companies from the comparable companies a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use monetization model margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors 

the company determines the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks the future cash flows are based on the companys most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 105 to 275 in 2019 and 105 to 35 in 2018  and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 8 in 2019 and 075 to 8 in 2018  

if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment equal to the excess is recorded the aggregate carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 10 is approximately 1212 million 

the 2019 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets identified a 33 million goodwill impairment charge and 07 million trade name impairment both related to the college humor media business and a 66 million impairment charge related to a trade name at mtch 

the 2018 annual assessment of goodwill did not identify any impairments the 2018 annual assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets identified impairment charges of 277 million and 11 million related to certain desktop and college humor media indefinitelived trade names respectively the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charge at desktop was due to google’s policy changes related to its chrome browser which became effective on september 12 2018 and have negatively impacted the distribution of our b2c downloadable desktop products the impairment charge related to the b2c trade name was identified in our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2018 and reflects the projected reduction in profits and revenues and the resultant reduction in the assumed royalty rate from these policy changes the impairment charges are included in amortization of intangibles in the consolidated statement of operations 

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising rightofuse assets rou assets property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed the carrying value of these longlived assets is 6711 million and 4921 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized at december 31 2019 and 2018  the balance of the companys net deferred tax asset is 1457 million and 412 million  respectively 

the company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach recognition step one occurs when the company concludes that a tax position based solely on its technical merits is morelikelythannot to be sustainable upon examination measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the morelikelythannot threshold of being sustained this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes at december 31 2019 and 2018  the company has unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 744 million and 523 million  respectively we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes although management currently believes changes to unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

the company has not provided for approximately 21 million of deferred taxes on 418 million of international cash earnings that are indefinitely reinvested outside the us the remaining 1712 million of international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences the company reassesses its intention to remit or permanently reinvest these cash earnings each reporting period any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the company changes this intention during the year ended december 31 2019  international cash totaling 701 million was repatriated to the us 

stockbased compensation 

the company recorded stockbased compensation expense of 2408 million and 2384 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively included in stockbased compensation expense in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is 326 million and 706 million respectively related to the modification of previously issued homeadvisor equity awards and previously issued angies list equity awards both of which were converted into angi homeservices equity awards in the combination and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of angies list employees in connection with the combination 

stockbased compensation at the company is complex due to our desire to attract retain inspire and reward outstanding entrepreneurs and managers at each of our companies including recently acquired companies by allowing them to benefit directly from the value they help to create we accomplish these objectives in part by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our nonpublic subsidiaries as well as in iac mtch and angi we further refine this approach by tailoring certain equity awards to the applicable circumstances for example we issue certain equity awards for which vesting is linked to the achievement of a performance target such as revenue or profits these awards are referred to as performancebased awards in other cases we link the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of a value target for a subsidiary or iac mtch or angi’s stock price as applicable these awards are referred to as marketbased awards the nature and variety of these types of equitybased awards creates complexity in our determination of stockbased compensation expense 

in addition acquisitions are an important part of the companys growth strategy these transactions may result in the modification of equity awards which creates additional complexity and additional stockbased compensation expense for example the combination resulted in the conversion of previously issued homeadvisor and angie’s list awards into angi homeservices awards and the recognition of additional stockbased compensation expense as described below in addition our internal reorganizations can also lead to modifications of equity awards and result in additional complexity and stockbased compensation expense 

finally the means by which we settle our equitybased awards also introduces complexity into our financial reporting we provide a path to liquidity by settling the nonpublic subsidiary denominated awards in iac mtch or angi shares as applicable in addition certain former mtch and angi subsidiary denominated awards can be settled in iac or mtch and angi awards at the company’s election these features increase the complexity of our earnings per share calculations 

the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued including those modified in connection with the combination using a blackscholes option pricing model and for those with a market condition a lattice model for stock options including subsidiary denominated equity the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term the impact on stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2019  assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a oneyear increase in the 

weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 31 million 136 million and 50 million respectively the company also issues rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased rsus for rsus the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved for marketbased rsus a lattice model is used to estimate the value of the awards 

investments in equity securities 

the company invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy our equity securities other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries and those accounted for under the equity method are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alternative of asu no 201601 following its adoption on january 1 2018 with changes recognized within other income expense net each reporting period under the measurement alternative equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transaction date a security will be considered identical or similar if it has identical or similar rights to the equity securities held by the company the company reviews its investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values for impairment each reporting period when there are qualitative factors or events that indicate possible impairment factors we consider in making this determination include negative changes in industry and market conditions financial performance business prospects and other relevant events and factors when indicators of impairment exist the company prepares quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments in equity securities which require judgment and the use of estimates when our assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is below its carrying value the company writes down the investment to its fair value and records the corresponding charge within other income expense net the carrying value of the company’s equity securities without readily determinable fair values is 3531 million and 2351 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively which is included in longterm investments in the consolidated balance sheet the company had an investment in pinterest which became a publiclytraded company in the second quarter of 2019 with effect from pinterests initial public offering the companys investment has been accounted for as a marketable security prior to this the company accounted for its investment in pinterest as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value during 2019 the company recognized a gain of 205 million on the sale of its remaining shares of pinterest during 2018 the company recognized a gain of 268 million on the sale of certain pinterest shares held by the company and a 1288 million unrealized gain or upward adjustment to adjust our remaining interest in pinterest to fair value in addition during 2019 the company recognized 145 million in net upward adjustments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values during 2018 the company recognized otherthantemporary impairments or downward adjustments of 49 million related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values and 06 million related to an equity method investment

at december 31 2019  the companys outstanding debt was 35 billion  of which 29 billion bears interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 1211 million  such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period the 425 million mtch term loan and the 2475 million outstanding balance on the angi term loan bear interest at variable rates the mtch term loan bears interest at libor plus 250  as of december 31 2019  the rate in effect was 444  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the mtch term loan would increase or decrease by 43 million  the angi term loan bears interest at libor plus 150  as of december 31 2019  the rate in effect was approximately 325  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the angi term loan would increase or decrease by 25 million  

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as a result is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp

the company is also exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses to the extent it or its subsidiaries conduct transactions in andor have assets andor liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency the company recorded foreign exchange losses and gains of 10 million  53 million and 168 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in gbp versus the us dollar during 2018 and 2017 generated the majority of the companys foreign currency exchange gains and losses in these years the foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily related to a us dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a 2016 acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency the foreign exchange losses in 2017 were further impacted by us dollar denominated cash the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the pricerunner sale in march 2016 held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency subsequent to december 31 2017 the company moved this us dollar denominated cash to a us dollar functional currency entity

all of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review the profiles of other users without charge each product also offers additional features some of which are free and some of which are paid depending on the particular product in general access to premium features requires a subscription which is typically offered in packages primarily ranging from one month to six months depending on the product and circumstance prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of subscription purchased the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers in addition to subscriptions many of our dating products offer users certain features such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other users and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use basis the precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution 

revenue 

match group revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions revenue is also earned from online advertising the purchase of à la carte features and offline events 

marketing 

certain of our brands attract the majority of their users through wordofmouth and other free channels our other brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of social media advertising banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns video advertising business development or partnership deals and hiring influencers to promote our dating products our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts as well as events 

competition 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products 

in addition to other online dating brands we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services such as in‑person matchmakers arguably our biggest competition comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors 



 lastly since a large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time either concurrently or sequentially we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage

competition

we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors

pursuant to this agreement those of our desktop businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our desktop businesses and then clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us see item 1arisk factorswe depend upon arrangements with google

risk factors 

our success depends in substantial part on our continued ability to market distribute and monetize our products and services through search engines social media platforms and digital app stores 

the marketing distribution and monetization of our products and services depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with search engines social media platforms and digital app stores in particular those operated by google facebook and apple these platforms could decide not to market and distribute some or all of our products and services change their terms and conditions of use at any time and without notice favor their own products and services over ours andor significantly increase their fees while we expect to maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with these platforms no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so in the case of one or more of these platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in particular as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications we primarily in the case of our dating and mosaic group businesses increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications including those relating to the amount of and requirement to pay certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by apple and google through our mobile applications to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute mobile applications through their stores the features we provide and the manner in which we market inapp products we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications the features we provide and the manner in which we market our inapp products to the extent either or both of them do so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition the use of certain of our products and services also depends in part on social media platforms for example many users of match group’s tinder hinge and certain other dating products historically registered for and logged into these dating products exclusively through their facebook profiles while match group launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for and log into tinder hinge and other affected products using their mobile phone number no assurances can be provided that users will no longer register for and log into tinder hinge and other affected products through their facebook profiles facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the data collected by its platform and the use of such data and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook as an authentication method or to allow facebook to use such data to gain a competitive advantage if any such event were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon the continued migration of certain markets and industries online and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services 

through our various businesses we provide a variety of online products and services that continue to compete with their traditional offline counterparts we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend to a large extent on the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online 

for example the success of the businesses within our match group segment depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the dating market online our ability to continue to provide dating products that users find more efficient effective comfortable and convenient relative to traditional means of meeting people and the continued erosion of stigma surrounding online dating particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world if for any reason the dating market does not continue to migrate online as quickly as or at lower levels than we expect andor a meaningful number of users do not embrace our dating products andor return to offline dating products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

similarly the success of the businesses within our angi homeservices segment depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the home services market online if for any reason the home services market does not migrate online as quickly as or at lower levels than we expect and consumers and service professionals continue in large part to rely on traditional offline efforts to connect with one another our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly as it relates to our advertisingsupported businesses our success also depends in part on our ability to compete for a share of available advertising expenditures as more traditional offline and emerging media companies continue to enter the online advertising market as well as on the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally if for any reason online advertising is not perceived as effective relative to traditional advertising and related mobile and other advertising models are not accepted web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace andor the industry fails to effectively manage click fraud the market for online advertising will be negatively impacted any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

marketing efforts designed to drive visitors to our various brands and businesses may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google and to a lesser extent microsoft and yahoo online display advertising and traditional offline advertising including television and radio campaigns in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective historically we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and convert consumers retain users and sustain our growth 

our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant thirdparty seller publisher of advertising including search engines and social media platforms with extraordinarily high levels of traffic and numbers of users or marketing affiliate as a result we cannot assure you that these parties will not limit or prohibit us from purchasing certain types of advertising advertising certain of our products and services andor using one or more current or prospective marketing channels in the future if a significant marketing channel took such an action generally for a significant period of time andor on a recurring basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if we fail to comply with the policies of thirdparty sellers publishers of advertising andor marketing affiliates our advertisements could be removed without notice andor our accounts could be suspended or terminated any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by search engines without advance notice could adversely affect both our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic such changes could adversely affect paid listings both their placement and pricing as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within search results any or all of which could increase our costs particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and adversely affect the effectiveness of our marketing efforts overall certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization through facebook and other social media platforms for example developing content designed to appear higher in a given facebook news feed and generate likes that involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts 

evolving consumer behavior specifically increased consumption of media through digital means can also affect the availability of costeffective marketing opportunities to continue to reach consumers engage with users and continue to grow in this environment we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels such as online video and other digital platforms as well as target consumers and users via these channels since newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels such as television it could be difficult to assess returns on our related marketing investments which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly we also enter into various arrangements with third parties to drive visitors to our various brands and businesses which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the quality and convertibility of leads generated through thirdparty arrangements are dependent on many factors most of which are outside our control if the quality andor convertibility of leads do not meet the expectations of the users of our various products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our brands and businesses operate in especially competitive industries 

the industries in which our brands and businesses operate are competitive with a consistent and growing stream of new products and entrants some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas user demographics andor other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future generally and particularly in the case of our dating business we compete with social media platforms with access to large existing pools of potential users and their personal information which means these platforms can drive visitors to their products and services as well as use better tailor products and service to individual users at little to no cost relative to our efforts for example our dating business competes with facebook which introduced a dating feature on its 

platform that it is testing in certain markets and intends to roll out globally in the near future we also compete generally with search engine providers and online marketplaces that can market their products and services online in a more prominent and costeffective manner than we can any of these advantages could enable our competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers than our products and services respond more quickly andor cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends andor display their own integrated or related products and services in a more prominent manner than our products and services in search results which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition costs to switch among products and services are low or nonexistent and consumers generally have a propensity to try new products and services and use multiple products and services simultaneously as a result we expect the continued emergence of new products and services entrants and business models in the various industries in which our brands and businesses operate our inability to compete effectively against new products services and competitors could result in decreases in the size and levels of engagement of our various user subscriber and membership bases which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal and recognition within their respective markets and industries as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in large part on our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our emerging brands events that could adversely impact our brands and brandbuilding efforts include among others product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers ineffective advertising inappropriate andor unlawful actions taken by users actions taken by governmental or regulatory authorities data protection and security breaches and related bad publicity the occurrence or any of these events could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices 

as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile and other digital devices including through digital voice assistants we will need to devote significant time and resources to ensure that our products and services are accessible across these platforms and multiple platforms generally if we do not keep pace with evolving online market and industry trends including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally offer new andor enhanced products and services in response to such trends that resonate with consumers monetize products and services for mobile and other digital devices as effectively as our traditional products and services andor maintain related systems technology and infrastructure in an efficient and costeffective manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition the success of our mobile and other digital products and services depends on their interoperability with various thirdparty operating systems technology infrastructure and standards over which we have no control any changes to any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our mobile and digital products and services could adversely affect their usage levels andor our ability to attract consumers and advertisers which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our brands and businesses are sensitive to general economic events or trends particularly those that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to online advertising primarily revenue from our dotdash and applications segments and our ask media group business accordingly events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures andor levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the businesses within our angi homeservices segment are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects andor service professionals being less likely to pay for marketplace subscriptions and consumer matches could result in decreases in marketplace service requests and directory searches any such decreases could result in turnover at the marketplace andor any of our directories adversely impact the number and quality of service professionals at the marketplace and our directories 

andor adversely impact the reach of and breath of services offered through the marketplace and our directories any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly we have historically been and will continue to be sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased marketing and advertising expenditures by service professionals adverse economic conditions and trends could result in service professionals decreasing andor delaying membership subscriptions fees paid for consumer matches andor timebased advertising spend any or all of which would result in decreased revenue and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to communicate with our users and consumers via email or other sufficient means is critical to our success  

as consumers increasingly communicate via mobile and other digital devices and messaging and social media apps usage of email particularly among younger consumers has declined and we expect this trend to continue in addition deliverability and other restrictions could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to users and consumers a continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate with consumers and users via email could adversely impact the user experience engagement levels and conversion rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that any means of communication for example push notifications will be as effective as email has been historically 

we may need to offset increasing digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally  

we increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute the mobile applications of our various businesses while some of our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores many of our mobile applications primarily our dating and mosaic group applications are subscriptionbased andor offer inapp à la carte features for a fee we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and à la carte features are sold however related purchases must be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and to a lesser extent google as a result we pay apple and google as applicable a meaningful share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions while we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods given the increasing distribution of our mobile applications through digital app stores and strict inapp payment system requirements we may need to offset these increased digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected additionally to the extent google changes its terms and conditions or practices to require us to process purchases of subscriptions and à la carte features through its inapp payment system our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part of the ability of angi homeservices to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals 

we will need to continue to attract retain and grow the number of skilled and reliable service professionals who can provide home services across angi homeservices platforms if we do not offer innovative products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally as well provide service professionals with an attractive return on their marketing and advertising investments quality matches and leads that convert into jobs the number of service professionals affiliated with angi homeservices platforms would decrease any such decrease would result in smaller and less diverse networks and directories of service professionals and in turn decreases in service requests and directory searches which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon arrangements with google 

a meaningful portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to a services agreement with google pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our applications and certain emerging  other properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services our current agreement with google expires on march 31 2020 in february 2019 we amended this agreement effective as 

of april 1 2020 to extend the expiration date of our agreement to march 31 2023 provided however that beginning september 2020 and each september thereafter we or google may after discussion with the other party terminate the services agreement effective on september 30 of the year following the year such notice is given we believe that the amended agreement taken as a whole is comparable to our current agreement with google 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends on a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches performed on our properties and these judgments factor into the number of advertisements we can purchase changes to the amount google charges advertisers the efficiency of google’s paid listings network googles judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our properties or to the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings generally could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive from google and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines for the use of google brands and services including the chrome browser and chrome web store these guidelines govern which of our products and applications may access google services or be distributed through its chrome web store and the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results across various thirdparty platforms and products including our properties our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for certain of our applications properties could if not cured result in the suspension of some or all google services to our properties or the websites of our thirdparty partners andor the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of our rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise andor the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate provider of paid listings or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 

we operate in various foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as a result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp during the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 approximately 34 and 30 of our total revenues respectively were international revenues we translate international revenues into us dollardenominated results as a result as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects the periodoverperiod comparability of operating results we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses to the extent we or our subsidiaries conduct transactions in andor have assets andor liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the relevant entitys functional currency for details regarding exchange rates and foreign currency exchange gains and losses for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 see item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency exchange risk 

brexit may continue to cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide and the full impact of the brexit decision remains uncertain ongoing negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union will determine the terms of their relationship following brexit during this period of negotiation and following the completion of brexit our operating results could be adversely affected by exchange rate and other market and economic volatility 

we have not hedged foreign currency exposures historically given that related gains or losses were not material to the company as we continue to grow and expand our international operations our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations will increase and if significant could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems technology and infrastructure from cyberattacks and cyberattacks experienced by third parties may adversely affect us 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technologyrelated events such as the use of botnets malware or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks phishing attempts to misappropriate user information and account login credentials and other similar malicious activities the incidence of events of this nature or any combination thereof is on the rise worldwide while we continuously develop and maintain systems designed to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our systems technology infrastructure products services and users have invested and continue to invest heavily in these efforts and related personnel and training and deploy data minimization strategies where appropriate these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite these efforts some of our systems have experienced past security incidents none of which had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and we could experience significant events of this nature in the future 

any event of this nature that we experience could damage our systems technology and infrastructure andor those of our users prevent us from providing our products and services compromise the integrity of our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities fines andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties even if we do not experience such events firsthand the impact of any such events experienced by third parties could have a similar effect we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events if we or any thirdparty with whom we do business or otherwise rely upon experiences an event of this nature our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if personal confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate and our reputation could be harmed 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal confidential or sensitive user information and in the case of certain of our products and services enable users to share their personal information with each other while we continuously develop and maintain systems designed to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information when such events occur we may not be able to remedy them and it may be costly to mitigate and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring when breaches of security ours or that of any thirdparty we engage to store information occurs the reputation of our brands and business could be harmed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit card data security breaches or fraud that we or third parties experience could adversely affect us 

certain of our businesses accept payment including recurring payments via credit and debit cards and certain online payment service providers the ability of these businesses to access payment information on a real time‑basis without having to proactively reach out to users to process payments is critical to our success 

when we or a thirdparty experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their cards in the case of a breach experienced by a thirdparty the more sizable the thirdparty’s customer base the greater the number of accounts impacted and the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach if our users were affected we would need to contact affected users to obtain new payment information it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users and even if we could new payment information for some individuals may not be obtained and pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of providers of online products and services to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant effort 

if we fail to prevent credit card data security breaches and fraudulent credit card transactions we could face litigation governmental enforcement action fines civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures higher credit cardrelated costs and substantial remediation costs or credit card processors could cease doing business with us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including personal credit card data as well as private content such as videos and correspondence in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services payment transactions and advertising on our various properties the manner in which we share store use disclose and protect this information is determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses as well as federal state and foreign laws and regulations and evolving industry standards and practices which are changing and in some cases inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations in addition new laws regulations standards and practices of this nature are proposed and adopted from time to time 

for example a comprehensive european union privacy and data protection reform the general data protection regulation the gdpr became effective in may 2018 the gdpr which applies to companies that are organized in the european union or otherwise provide services to or monitor consumers who reside in the european union imposes significant penalties monetary and otherwise for noncompliance the gdpr will continue to be interpreted by european union data protection regulators which may require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional risks and liabilities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communications directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies in addition the potential exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the united kingdom in addition there are a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations recently passed or under consideration by the us congress as well as in various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business including the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which becomes effective january 1 2020 

while we believe that we comply with applicable privacy and data protection policies laws and regulations and industry standards and practices in all material respects we could still be subject to claims of noncompliance that we may not be able to successfully defend andor significant fines and penalties moreover any noncompliance or perceived noncompliance by us or any thirdparty we engage to store or process information or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or use or transmission of personal information could result in a variety of claims against us including governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity when such events occur our reputation could be harmed and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly ongoing compliance with existing and compliance with future privacy and data protection laws worldwide could be costly the devotion of significant costs to compliance versus to product development could result in delays in the development of new products and services us ceasing to provide problematic products and services in existing jurisdictions and us being prevented from introducing products and services in new and existing jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on the integrity quality efficiency and scalability of our systems technology and infrastructure and those of third parties 

we rely on our systems technology and infrastructure to perform well on a consistent basis from time to time in the past we have experienced and in the future we may experience occasional interruptions that make some or all of this framework and related information unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons we also rely on thirdparty data center service providers and cloudbased hosted web service providers as well as thirdparty computer systems and a variety of communications systems 

and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain payment and other transactions with users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

the framework described could be damaged or interrupted at any time due to fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions any event of this nature could prevent us from providing our products and services at all or result in the provision of our products on a delayed or interrupted basis andor result in the loss of critical data while we and the third parties upon whom we rely have certain backup systems in place for certain aspects of our respective frameworks none of our frameworks are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption when such damages interruptions or outages occur our reputation could be harmed and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our framework to improve the consumer experience accommodate substantial increases in the number of visitors to our various platforms ensure acceptable load times for our various products and services and keep up with changes in technology user preferences if we do not do so in a timely and costeffective manner the user experience and demand across our brands and businesses could be adversely affected which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

mr diller and certain members of his family are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of the date of this report mr diller his spouse diane von furstenberg and his stepson alexander von furstenberg collectively beneficially owned shares of class b common stock and common stock that represented approximately 428 of the total outstanding voting power of iac based on the number of shares of iac common stock outstanding on february 1 2019 for details regarding the iac securities beneficially owned by mr diller ms von furstenberg and mr von furstenberg see item 1businessequity ownership and vote 

as a result of iac securities beneficially owned by these individuals they are collectively currently in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals particularly in the case of senior management competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and we must attract new and retain existing employees to compete effectively while we have established programs to attract new and retain existing employees we may not be able to attract new or retain existing key and other employees in the future in addition if we do not ensure the effective transfer of knowledge to successors and smooth transitions particularly in the case of senior management across our various businesses our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

our current and future indebtedness could affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 23 billion of which 552 million 15 billion and 2613 million was owed by iac match group and angi homeservices respectively as of that date we match group and angi homeservices had borrowing availability of 250 million 240 million and 250 million respectively under our revolving credit facilities neither match group angi homeservices nor any of their respective subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are currently subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness similarly neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries other than match group and its subsidiaries in the case of match group indebtedness and angi homeservices and its subsidiaries in the case of angi homeservices 

indebtedness guarantee any indebtedness of match group or angi homeservices nor are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness 

the terms of the indebtedness of iac match group and angi homeservices could 

 subject to certain restrictions we and our subsidiaries may incur additional unsecured and secured indebtedness if additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions is significant the risks described above could increase 

lastly if an event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds specified thresholds our ability to pay dividends make distributions and repurchase or redeem our capital stock would be limited match group and angi homeservices are subject to similar restrictions see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial position liquidity and capital resources and financial position 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness 

the ability of iac match group and angi homeservices to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

 neither we nor match group nor angi homeservices may be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our respective operations andor borrow under our respective revolving credit facilities in amounts sufficient to meet our scheduled debt obligations see also we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries below if so we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or seek additional capital in a manner that complies with the terms including certain restrictions and limitations of our current indebtedness if these efforts do not generate sufficient funds to meet our scheduled debt obligations we would need to seek additional financing andor negotiate with our lenders to restructure or refinance our indebtedness our ability to do so would depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any such financing restructuring or refinancing could be on less favorable terms than those governing our current indebtedness and would need to comply with the terms including certain restrictions and limitations of our existing indebtedness 

we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries 

potential sources of cash for iac include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of certain of our subsidiaries availability under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales including marketable securities while the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and applicable statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions generally in the case of match group and angi homeservices the terms of their indebtedness limit their ability to pay dividends or make distributions loans or advances to stockholders including iac in addition because match group and angi homeservices are separate and distinct legal entities with public shareholders they have no obligation to provide us with funds 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2018 match group had 260 million and 425 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and term loan respectively and angi homeservices has 2631 million outstanding under its term loan borrowings under these loans are and any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities of iac or angi homeservices will be at variable interest rates which exposes us to interest rate risk for details regarding interest rates applicable to the variable rate indebtedness of match group and angi homeservices described above as of december 31 2018 and how certain increases and decreases in libor rate would affect related interest expense see item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

you may experience dilution with respect to your investment in iac and iac may experience dilution with respect to its investments in match group and angi homeservices as a result of compensatory equity awards 

we have issued various compensatory equity awards including stock options stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of our common stock as well as in equity of our various consolidated subsidiaries including match group and angi homeservices for more information regarding these awards and their impact on our diluted earnings per share calculation see note 11stockbased compensation and note 10earnings per share respectively to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the issuance of shares of iac common stock in settlement of these equity awards could dilute your ownership interest in iac awards denominated in shares of match group or angi homeservices common stock that are settled in shares of those subsidiaries could dilute iac’s ownership interest in match group and angi homeservices respectively the dilution of our ownership stakes in match group andor angi homeservices could impact our ability among other things to maintain match group andor angi homeservices as part of our consolidated tax group for us federal income tax purposes to effect a taxfree distribution of our match group andor angi homeservices stakes to our stockholders or to maintain control of match group andor angi homeservices as we generally have the right to maintain our levels of ownership in match group and angi homeservices to the extent match group or angi homeservices issues additional shares of their respective capital stock in the future pursuant to investor rights agreements we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur 

with respect to awards denominated in shares of our nonpublicly traded subsidiaries we estimate the dilutive impact of those awards based on our estimated fair value of those subsidiaries those estimates may change from time to time and the fair value determined in connection with vesting and liquidity events could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation 

we may experience risks related to acquisitions 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms our growth could be adversely affected 

even if we complete what we believe to be suitable acquisitions we may experience related operational and financial risks so to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 



 we may not be successful in addressing these or any other acquisitionrelated challenges in addition acquisitionrelated cost savings growth opportunities synergies or other benefits may not be realized also future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities lastly the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face additional risks in connection with our international operations 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks including 

 the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations our success in international markets will also depend in large part on our ability to successfully complete international acquisitions joint ventures or other transactions and integrate these businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business including among others broadband internet access online commerce advertising privacy and data protection intermediary liability consumer protection protection of minors taxation and securities compliance these domestic and foreign laws which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the 

application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the internet industry and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as well as in a manner that could conflict with our current policies and practices we face the same issues in the case of amended proposed or new laws and regulations 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as responding to any related inquiries investigations or other government action could be costly delay or impede the development of new products and services require modifications to existing products and services andor require significant management time and attention noncompliance could subject us to remedies that could harm our business such as fines demands or orders that require us to modify or cease then current products and services as well as result in negative publicity consequences of compliance and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations if significant could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the internet andor online products and services generally restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our products and services regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered internet access for example in february 2019 the secretary of state for digital culture media and sport of the united kingdom indicated in public comments that his office intends to inquire as to the measures utilized by online dating platforms including tinder to prevent access by underage users to the extent our dating business is required to implement new measures to prevent such access our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition in december 2017 the us federal communications commission the fcc adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the united states including the repeal of specific rules against blocking throttling or paid prioritization of content or services by internet service providers to the extent internet service providers take such actions our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are also sensitive to the adoption of any law or regulation affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example the european union payment services directive which became effective in 2018 could impact the ability of our businesses to process autorenewal payments for as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing to users who reside in the european union similar new legislation or regulations or changes to existing legislation or regulations governing subscription payments are being considered in many us states 

we are also sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws the european commission and several european countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed including proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example the united kingdom has proposed a digital services tax applicable to revenues of social media platforms online marketplaces and search engines linked to users residing in the united kingdom which would likely apply to certain of our business if enacted one or more of these or similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition as well as upon trade secrets we also rely to a lesser extent upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2037 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that these efforts will result in adequate trademark and service mark protection adequate domain name rights and protections the issuance of a patent or adequate patent protection against competitors and similar technologies third parties could also create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures challenges to our intellectual property rights could still arise third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization andor laws regarding the enforceability of existing intellectual property rights could change in an adverse manner the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing online using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business related to alleged claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others and may need to institute legal proceedings in the future to enforce protect or refine the scope of our intellectual property rights for example on march 17 2018 our match group business filed a lawsuit against bumble trading inc which operates and markets the online dating application bumble in the united states for patent and trademark infringement as well as trade secret misappropriation bumble’s counterclaims request that our trademark registration for tinder’s swipe trademark be canceled and that a number of our pending applications for trademark registration be denied this case is currently pending in federal court in the western district of texas any legal proceedings related to intellectual property regardless of outcome or merit could be costly and result in diversion of and technical resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

angi revenue is primarily derived from i consumer connection revenue which comprises fees paid by homeadvisor service professionals for consumer matches regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the handy platform and ii membership subscription fees paid by homeadvisor service professionals consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors including the service requested product experience offered and geographic location of service effective with the combination described below revenue is also derived from angies list i sales of timebased website mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and ii membership subscription fees from consumers

a meaningful portion of the revenue of the desktop business within the applications segment and the ask media group within the emerging  other segment is attributable to a services agreement with google inc google the services agreement became effective on april 1 2016 following the expiration of the previous services agreement and expires on march 31 2020 on february 11 2019 the company and google amended the services agreement effective as of april 1 2020 the amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to march 31 2023 provided that beginning september 2020 and each september thereafter either party may after discussion with the other party terminate the services agreement effective on september 30 of the year following the year such notice is given the services agreement requires that the company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations google’s policy changes related to its chrome browser became effective on september 12 2018 and negatively impacted the distribution of our businesstoconsumer b2c desktop products the impact of these changes on revenue and profits in 2018 were modest as the company optimized marketing spend in anticipation of the changes however we expect these changes to reduce revenue and profits of the desktop business in the future which among other reasons led to a 277 million impairment of the related indefinitelived intangible asset in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the years ended december 31 2018  2017   and   2016  consolidated revenue earned from google was 8252 million  7407 million  and 8244 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  revenue earned from google represents 73  83  and 87  of applications revenue and 94  96  and 96  of ask media group revenue and 68  48  and 35  of emerging  other revenue respectively

principles of financial reporting 

iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of nongaap measure 

  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda  is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated statement of operations of certain expenses 

the following table reconciles net earnings loss attributable to iac shareholders to operating income loss to consolidated adjusted ebitda 

for a reconciliation of operating income loss to adjusted ebitda for the companys reportable segments see  note 12—segment information  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  

noncash expenses that are excluded from our nongaap measure 

  stockbased compensation   expense  consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions including the combination of stock options restricted stock units rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period to the extent that stockbased awards are settled on a net basis the company remits the required taxwithholding amounts from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

  amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions including the combination at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as technology service professional and contractor relationships customer lists and user base memberships trade names and content are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in  note 2—summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements 

acquisitions are an important part of the companys growth strategy the company invested 2433 million including the value of angi homeservices class a common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of handy 9121 million including the value of angi class a common stock issued in connection with the combination and 361 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting units that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 

in connection with certain business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is the companys largest asset with a carrying value of 27 billion  and 26 billion  at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 4581 million  and 4591 million   at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value in performing its annual assessment the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2018 a qualitative assessment of the mtch angi vimeo college humor media and bluecrew reporting units goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values the primary fact ors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below 



the company tests goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2018 the company quantitatively tested the desktop and mosaic group reporting units included in the applications segment the companys quantitative test indicated that the fair value of these reporting units is in excess of their respective carrying values therefore the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired the companys dotdash ask media group and the daily beast reporting units have no goodwill 

the aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 110 of their carrying values is approximately 2651 million 

the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the companys reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment equal to the excess is recorded 

the fair value of the companys reporting units except for mtch and angi described above is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its nonpublic subsidiary denominated stockbased compensation plans which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed based on each reporting units current results and forecasted future performance as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the companys reporting units ranged from 125  to 15  in 2018 and 125  to 175  in 2017 determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer gr oup of companies from the comparable companies a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to  estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use monetization model margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability the determination of fair value is based in part upon the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying values the companys policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 the company determines the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 105  to 35  in 2018 and 11  to 16  in 2017 and the royalty rates used ranged from 075  to 80  in 2018 and 2  to 7  in 2017 

the aggregate indefinitelived intangible asset balance for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 110 of their carrying values is approximately 1313 million 

the 2018 annual assessment of goodwill did not identify any impairments the 2018 annual assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets identified impairment charges of 277 million and 11 million related to certain desktop and college humor media indefinitelived trade names respectively the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charge at desktop was due to google’s policy changes related to its chrome browser which became effective on september 12 2018 and have negatively impacted the distribution of our b2c downloadable desktop products the impairment charge related to the b2c trade name was identified in our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2018 and reflects the projected reduction in profits and revenues and the resultant reduction in the assumed royalty rate from these policy changes the impairment charges are included in amortization of intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

the 2017 annual assessments did not identify any impairments 

while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments during the second quarter of 2016 the company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire 2754 million at iac publishing in connection with the companys realignment of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 1983 million and 770 million was allocated to the dotdash and the emerging  other reportable segments respectively based upon their relative fair values as of october 1 2018 in addition amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of impairment charges in 2016 of 90 million and 26 million related to certain dictionarycom and dotdash indefinitelived trade names respectively 

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 4921 million and 5198 million at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized at december 31 2018 and 2017 the balance of the companys net deferred tax asset is 412 million  and 313 million  respectively 

the company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach recognition step one occurs when the company concludes that a tax position based solely on its technical merits is morelikelythannot to be sustainable upon examination measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the morelikelythannot threshold of being sustained this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes at december 31 2018 and 2017 the company has unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 523 million  and 397 million  respectively we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

at december 31 2018  all of the company’s international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences the company has not provided for approximately 10 million  of foreign deferred taxes for the 1031 million  of the foreign cash earnings that is indefinitely reinvested outside the us the company reassesses its intention to remit or permanently reinvest these cash earnings each reporting period any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the company changes this intention during the year ended december 31 2018  international cash totaling 3962 million  was repatriated to the us 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax act the tax act imposes a new minimum tax on gilti earned by foreign subsidiaries beginning in 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income states that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred the company elects to recognize the tax on gilti as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt including current maturities 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which may consist of money market funds treasury discount notes commercial paper and time deposits and shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2018  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by 01 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period however since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of 21 billion  was invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2018  the companys outstanding debt was 23 billion  of which 14 billion  bears interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 582 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period the 425 million  mtch term loan the 2613 million  outstanding balance on the angi term loan and the 260 million  of outstanding borrowings under the mtch credit facility bear interest at variable rates the mtch term loan bears interest at libor plus 250 as of december 31 2018  the rate in effect was 509  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the mtch term loan would increase or decrease by 43 million the angi term loan bears interest at libor plus 150 as of december 31 2018  the rate in effect was approximately 400  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the angi term loan would increase or decrease by 26 million the mtch credit facility bears interest at libor plus 150 as of december 31 2018  the rate in effect was approximately 400  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the mtch credit facility would increase or decrease by 26 million

services 

through the brands within our dating business we are a leading provider of subscription dating products servicing north america western europe asia and many other regions around the world through websites and applications that we own and operate 

all of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review the profiles of other users without charge each product also offers additional features some of which are free and some of which are paid depending on the particular product in general access to premium features requires a subscription which is typically offered in packages primarily ranging from one month to six months depending on the product and circumstance prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of subscription purchased the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers in addition to subscriptions many of our dating products offer users certain features such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other users and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use or à la carte basis the precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution 

revenue 

match group revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions revenue is also earned from online advertising the purchase of à la carte features where users pay a nonrecurring fee for a specific action or event and offline events 

marketing 

we attract the majority of users of our dating products through wordofmouth and other free channels in addition many of our brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns video advertising business development or partnership deals and hiring influencers to promote our dating products our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts as well as events 

competition 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products in addition to other online dating brands we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services such as in‑person matchmakers arguably our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors 



 lastly we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage given that a large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time either concurrently or sequentially

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this annual report on form 10k contains “forward‑looking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the use of words such as “anticipates” “estimates” “expects” “plans” and “believes” among others generally identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include among others statements relating to iac’s future financial performance iac’s business prospects and strategy anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which iac’s businesses operate and other similar matters these forwardlooking statements are based on iac managements expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report which are inherently subject to uncertainties risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict 

actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward‑looking statements for a variety of reasons including among others the risk factors set forth below other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect iac’s business financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time in light of these risks and uncertainties the forward‑looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate accordingly you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which only reflect the views of iac management as of the date of this annual report iac does not undertake to update these forward‑looking statements 

risk factors 

our success depends in substantial part on our continued ability to market distribute and monetize our products and services through search engines social media platforms and digital app stores 

the marketing distribution and monetization of our products and services depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with search engines social media platforms and digital app stores in particular those operated by google facebook and apple these platforms could decide not to market and distribute some or all of our products and services change their terms and conditions of use at any time and without notice favor their own products and services over ours andor significantly increase their fees while we expect to maintain costeffective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with these platforms no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so in the case of one or more of these platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the risk factors below discuss these risks in the case of certain of our businesses in greater detail 

our success depends in part upon the continued migration of certain markets and industries online and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services 

through our various businesses we provide a variety of online products and services that continue to compete with their traditional offline counterparts we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend to a large extent on the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online 

for example the success of the businesses within our match group segment depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the dating market online we believe this migration will be driven in substantial part by the continued proliferation of mobile devices worldwide which continues to expand the ways in which people can interact and build relationships and increasing social acceptance and adoption of online dating products generally the success of these businesses will also depend in part on our ability to continue to provide dating products that users find more efficient effective comfortable and convenient relative to traditional means of meeting people the failure of a meaningful number of users to embrace our dating products andor the return of a meaningful number of users to offline dating products and services could adversely affect the businesses within our match group segment and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the success of the businesses within our angi homeservices segment depends in substantial part on the continued migration of the home services market online we believe that the digital penetration of the home services market remains low with the vast majority of consumers continuing to search for select and hire service professionals offline while many consumer demographics have historically been and remain averse to finding service professionals online others have demonstrated a greater willingness to embrace the online shift for example millennials service professionals must also embrace the online shift which will depend in substantial part on whether online products and services help them to better connect and engage with consumers relative to traditional offline efforts the speed and ultimate outcome of the shift of the home services market online for consumers and service professionals is uncertain and may not occur as quickly as we expect or at all the failure or delay of a meaningful number of consumers andor service professionals to migrate online andor the return of a meaningful number of existing participants in the online home services market to offline markets could adversely 

affect the businesses within our angi homeservices segment and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly our success also depends in part on our ability to compete for a share of available advertising expenditures as more traditional offline and emerging media companies continue to enter the online advertising market as well as the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally in addition to the factors discussed above in the case of online products and services generally we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend in large part on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of mobile advertising the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage the continuing and increasing problem of click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings andor any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to changes in laws changes in industry practices the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced products and services that resonate with consumers 

we may not be able to convert traffic to our various platforms into repeat users nor increase user engagement levels unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies in the various markets in which we operate as well as provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with consumers 

online products and services and related systems technology and infrastructure as well as the manner in which consumers access online products and services generally have historically been and are expected to continue to be subject to rapid change and continuing evolution we may not be able to adapt quickly enough or at all to online trends generally andor trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally appropriately time the introduction of new and enhanced products and services andor identify new business opportunities in a timely manner moreover the evolving preferences and needs of our users and consumers could require timely and costly updates to our products and services and related systems technology and infrastructure 

while the continued introduction of new andor enhanced products and services is critical to our success by definition new products and services have limited operating histories which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our then current business and future prospects for example through match group we seek to tailor each of our dating brands and products to meet the preferences of specific user communities building a given dating brand or product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures although certain of our newer dating brands and products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time the historical growth rates of these dating brands and products may not be an indication of future growth rates for our newer dating brands and products generally we have encountered and may continue to encounter risks and difficulties as we build new andor enhanced products and services 

lastly new technologies and policies could interfere with our ability to offer our products and services for example third parties continue to introduce technologies including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent consumers from installing certain types of applications andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that consumers will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use our failure to successfully modify our products and services in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies features and policies andor find alternative sources of revenue to support products and services that currently generate revenue through advertising could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to successfully address any of these risks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google and to a lesser extent microsoft and yahoo online display advertising and traditional offline advertising including television and radio campaigns in connection 

with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective historically we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and convert consumers retain users and sustain our growth 

in the case of paid advertising generally our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller publisher of advertising including search engines and social media platforms or marketing affiliate as a result a third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising andor advertise certain of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that third parties will not limit or prohibit one or more of our businesses from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the future if a significant marketing channel were to impose such a limitation or prohibition on one of more of our businesses generally for a significant period of time andor on a recurring basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers publishers of advertising andor marketing affiliates our advertisements could be removed without notice andor our accounts could be suspended or terminated any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of our search engine marketing and optimization efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by search engines without advance notice could adversely affect both our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic such changes could adversely affect paid listings both their placement and pricing as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within search results any or all of which could increase our costs particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and adversely affect the effectiveness of our marketing efforts overall certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization through facebook and other social media platforms for example developing content designed to appear higher in a given facebook news feed and generate likes that involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts 

evolving consumer behavior can also affect the availability of costeffective marketing opportunities for example as traditional television viewership declines and media is increasingly consumed through various digital means the reach of traditional advertising channels is contracting and the number of digital advertising channels is expanding to continue to reach consumers engage with users and continue to grow in this environment we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels such as online video and other digital platforms as well as targeted consumer and user campaigns via these channels generally the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels which could make it difficult for us to assess returns on our marketing investment in the case of these channels in addition as we increasingly depend on newer digital means for traffic these efforts will involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts 

lastly we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing consumer traffic and users in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our brands and businesses operate in especially competitive industries and innovation by our competitors in these industries could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the dating and home services industries are competitive with a consistent and growing stream of new products and entrants some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas andor with consumer demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future in addition some of our competitors given the primary business in which they engage can market their products and services online in a more prominent and costeffective manner than we can any of these advantages could enable our competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers than our products and services andor respond more quickly andor cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends for example search engine providers continue to expand their product and service offerings into nonsearchrelated categories including home services search engine providers can and may display their own integrated or related home services products and services in a more prominent manner than our products and services in search results this could result in a substantial decrease in free and paid traffic to the businesses within our angi homeservices segment and in turn increased marketing expenditures particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic 

in addition within the dating and home services industries costs for consumers to switch among products and services are low or nonexistent and in the case of service providers while they would lose amounts paid for marketplace membership packages and advertising if they switched to a competitor before the expiration of the related term costs for switching over the long term are low low switching costs coupled with the propensity of consumers to try new products and services generally will most likely result in the continued emergence of new products and services entrants and business models in the dating and home services industries our inability to compete effectively against current or future competitors and new products and services that may emerge could result in decreases in the size and level of engagement of our user and service provider bases which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective markets and industries as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in large part on our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our emerging brands our brands and brandbuilding efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers inappropriate andor criminal actions taken by users and related media coverage actions taken by governmental or regulatory authorities and data protection and security breaches in addition trust in the integrity and objective unbiased nature of the ratings and reviews found across our home services brands particularly angie’s list contributes significantly to public perception of these brands and their ability to attract consumers and convert them into users if consumers perceive that ratings and reviews are not authentic in general the reputation and the strength of the relevant brand could be materially and adversely affected moreover the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices and market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our various brands and brandbuilding efforts and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile and other digital devices including through digital voice assistants we will need to devote significant time and resources to ensure that our products and services are accessible across these platforms and multiple platforms generally despite these efforts we may not be able to keep pace with evolving online trends generally andor trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally even if we do new andor enhanced products and services we offer may not resonate with consumers and in turn not generate sufficient traffic to our various brands and businesses moreover we may not be able to monetize products and services for mobile and other digital devices as effectively as we have been able to monetize our traditional products and services 

in addition the success of our mobile and digital applications is dependent on their interoperability with various third party operating systems technology infrastructure and standards over which we have no control and any changes to any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our mobile and digital applications could adversely affect their usage levels and in turn our ability to attract consumers and advertisers our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of consumers to mobile and other digital devices could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as technology continues to evolve products and services that we develop for mobile and other digital devices could require us to modify our related systems technology and infrastructure if these modifications are not done in an efficient and costeffective manner our products and services for mobile and other digital devices and related systems technology and infrastructure could be rendered obsolete 

the distribution and use of our products and services depends in part on third parties 

we distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels for example as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications we primarily in the case of our dating business and apalon one of the businesses within our applications segment increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications including those relating to the amount 

of and requirement to pay certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by apple and google through our mobile applications and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute mobile applications through their stores we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications if either or both of them did so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the use of certain of our products and services also depends in part on third parties for example many users of match groups tinder and certain other dating products currently register for and log in to these dating products exclusively through their facebook profiles while match group recently launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for and log into tinder using their mobile phone number no assurances can be provided that this method will be widely adopted by users facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook as an authentication method and if facebook did so and the alternate method described above is not widely adopted by users or becomes unavailable for any reason match group’s and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly certain of the businesses within our applications segment have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search boxes browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either nonexclusive and shortterm in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances the inability of these businesses to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute search boxes browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various brands and businesses queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general economic events or trends particularly those that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have historically been and will continue to be particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to online advertising primarily revenue from our applications and publishing segments accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

similarly some of our businesses primarily those within our angi homeservices segment are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior for example in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions consumer confidence spending levels and access to credit could be adversely affected the occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects which could result in decreases in marketplace service requests and related fees paid by marketplace service professionals for consumer matches which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition because a significant number of service professionals across angi homeservices brands are sole proprietorships and small businesses they may be particularly impacted by events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence spending behavior and access to credit if so they may be less likely to pay for marketplace membership andor advertising which could result in turnover at the marketplace andor any of our directories any significant andor recurring turnover over a prolonged period could adversely impact the number and quality of service professionals in the marketplace and our directories as well as the reach of and breadth of services offered through the marketplace and our directories any or all of which could result in a decrease in traffic to angi homeservices brands and businesses and increased costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers and limited access to credit which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

communicating with users and consumers via email is critical to our success and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

historically one of our primary means of communicating with consumers and keeping our users engaged with our products and services has been via email communication as consumer habits continue to evolve in the era of mobile and other digital devices and messaging and social media apps usage of email particularly among younger consumers has declined and we expect this trend to continue in addition deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party email providers andor applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to consumers and users a continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with consumers and users via email could have an adverse impact on the user experience user engagement levels and the rate at which non‑paying users become paid subscribers while we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with consumers and our users for example through push notifications we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as email has been historically any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication andor limitations on such means imposed by applicable law mobile and digital device manufacturers or otherwise could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates if a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

through match group we own operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for and revenue generation from that product’s user community in general the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands if a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable dating brands our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as the distribution of our dating products through digital app stores increases in order to maintain our profit margins we may need to offset increasing digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  

as users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile and other digital devices we increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores users can purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features through these applications we determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold however related purchases must be processed through the inapp payment systems provided by apple and to a lesser extent google as a result we pay apple and google as applicable a share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions while we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods given the increasing distribution of our dating products through digital app stores and inapp payment system requirements we may need to offset these increased digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part of the ability of angi homeservices to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals 

we will need to continue to attract retain and grow the number of skilled and reliable service professionals who can provide home services that consumers want in a timely manner across angi homeservices platforms to do so we must continue to offer products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally as well provide service professionals with an attractive return on their marketing and advertising investments if we fail to provide compelling products and services across angi homeservices brands and businesses marketplace service professionals may leave or fail to join the marketplace and certified service professionals may leave of fail to join the angie’s list nationwide online directory one or both of which would result in a less attractive overall digital marketplace for consumers seeking quality service professionals any decrease in quality service professionals or the lack of new quality service professionals would result in a smaller and less diverse marketplace and smaller and less diverse directories which could adversely impact the consumer experience and in turn result in decreases in service requests and directory searches which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a meaningful portion of our consolidated revenue and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access is attributable to a services agreement with google pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our applications and publishing properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services our current agreement with google expires on march 31 2020 and we may choose to terminate this agreement effective march 31 2019 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends on a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our applications and publishing properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase changes to the amount google charges advertisers the efficiency of google’s paid listings network googles judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our applications and publishing properties or to the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings generally could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive from google and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines for the use of google brands and services including guidelines that govern which products and applications may access google services and the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results across various third party platforms and products including our applications and publishing properties our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for certain of our applications properties could if not cured result in the suspension of some or all google services to our properties or the websites of our third party partners andor the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of our rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise andor the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in certain foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as a result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp during the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 approximately 30 and 26 respectively of our total revenues were international revenues we translate international revenues into us dollardenominated results as a result as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects the periodoverperiod comparability of operating results the average gbp and euro versus the us dollar exchange rate was approximately 5 higher and 2 lower respectively in 2017 compared to 2016 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses to the extent we or are subsidiaries conduct transactions in andor have assets andor liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the relevant entitys functional currency we recorded foreign currency exchange losses of 168 million and gains of 344 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in gbp versus the us dollar during 2017 and the decrease in the gbp versus the us dollar during 2016 following the brexit vote on june 23 2016 generated the majority of 

our foreign currency exchange losses and gains during these fiscal years for additional detail regarding these gains and losses see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency exchange risk 

 foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the company as a result historically we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new markets and jurisdictions increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems technology and infrastructure from cyberattacks in addition we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties any disruption of our systems technology and infrastructure or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyberattacks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks attempts to misappropriate user information including credit card information or other malicious activities events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems technology and infrastructure as well as our various products and services which could in turn adversely affect our users the incidence of events of this nature or any combination thereof is on the rise worldwide 

while we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses and their respective systems technology infrastructure products services and users and have invested and continue to invest heavily in these efforts and related personnel and training these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur that it will not adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems technology and infrastructure andor those of our users prevent us from providing our products and services compromise the integrity of our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities fines andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties even if we do not experience such events the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our operations could have a similar effect moreover even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in consumers being less likely to use online products and services generally 

in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events 

if the security of personal confidential or sensitive user information including credit card information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event our reputation could be harmed and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal confidential or sensitive user or other information including credit card information and in the case of certain of our products and services enable users to share their personal information with each other in some cases we retain third party vendors to store this information while we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts if any such event were to occur we may not be able to remedy the event and we may have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such an event and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring if a breach of our security or the security of third party vendors we have retained occurs the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed we could lose users and the recognition of our various brands and businesses and their competitive positions could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments including data security breaches fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our businesses accept payment including recurring payments from users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers the ability of these businesses to access payment information on a real time‑basis without having to proactively reach out to users to process payments for products and services including autorenewal payments or payments for premium features on or with certain of our products or services is critical to our success 

when we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their cards in the case of a breach experienced by a third party the more sizable the third party’s customer base the greater the number of accounts impacted and the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach if our users are ever affected by such a breach we would need to contact affected individuals to obtain new payment information and process any pending transactions it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals and even if we could new payment information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of providers of online products and services to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant effort 

our ability to access credit card information on a realtime basis without having to proactively reach out to affected individuals could also be adversely impacted by increases in various fees charged by credit card companies and processors such as transaction interchange chargeback andor other fees the malfunction of credit card billing systems and software and noncompliance with applicable payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers including the payment card industry data security standard pci dss a security standard with which companies that collect store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply 

if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions andor comply with the pci dss we could face litigation fines governmental enforcement action civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures significantly higher credit cardrelated costs and substantial remediation costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including personal credit card data as well as private content such as videos and correspondence in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services payment transactions and advertising on our various properties the manner in which we share store use disclose and protect this information is determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices regarding privacy generally and the sharing storage use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data these laws regulations standards and practices are changing inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations and new laws regulations standards and practices of this nature are proposed and adopted from time to time 

for example in 2016 the european commission adopted the general data protection regulation the gdpr a comprehensive european union privacy and data protection reform that becomes effective in may 2018 the gdpr which applies to companies that are organized in the european union or otherwise provide services to or monitor consumers who reside in the european union imposes strict standards regarding the sharing storage use disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties monetary and otherwise for noncompliance in addition the european union is considering an update to its privacy and electronic communications directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies in connection with the provision of online products and services to consumers who reside in the european union in addition the potential exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in the application of new and 

conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and how we handle personal data of consumers who reside in the united kingdom in addition there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the us including in various states and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 

while we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations standards and practices that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance moreover any failure or perceived failure by us or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information to comply with applicable privacy policies laws regulations or privacy‑related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or use or transmission of personal information could result in a variety of claims against us including governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity in the case of such an event our reputation may be harmed we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate particularly the gdpr could be costly as well as result in delays in the development of new products and services if significant resources are allocated to compliance efforts particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope more commonplace and continue to evolve if these costs andor product and service delays are significant our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly evolving privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which are businesses operate could prevent us from introducing products and services in jurisdictions in which we wish to do business andor continuing to offer certain products and services in jurisdictions in which we currently operate if markets in new jurisdictions in which we cannot do business are large andor revenue attributable to products and services we can no longer offer is significant our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on the integrity and quality of our systems technology and infrastructure and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may adversely affect our business 

to succeed our systems technology and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional interruptions that make some or all of our systems technology infrastructure or user data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons furthermore fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data cloudbased web hosting broadband wireless or other storage or communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing our products and services to consumers while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations our systems technology and infrastructure are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption any such interruptions or outages regardless of the cause could negatively impact the consumer experience tarnish the reputation of our brands and decrease demand for our products and services any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our systems technology and infrastructure to improve the consumer experience accommodate substantial increases in traffic volume to our various brands ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with technology and evolving user and consumer preferences any failure to do so in a timely and costeffective manner could adversely affect the user experience across our brands and businesses which could adversely affect demand for our products and services andor increase our costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data center service providers cloudbased web hosting service providers and broadband wireless and other communications systems service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with users we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

any interruptions outages or delays in our systems technology and infrastructure or those of our third party providers changes in service levels or any deterioration in performance could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of users which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy 

mr diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting andor investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock as a result mr diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of the date of this report mr diller his spouse diane von furstenberg and his stepson alexander von furstenberg collectively beneficially own 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock by virtue of their respective voting andor investment powers over these securities 4530075 of which are held in trusts for the benefit of mr diller and certain members of his family and the remainder of which are held by mr diller personally shares of iac class b common stock beneficially owned by mr diller his spouse and his stepson collectively represent 100 of iac’s outstanding class b common stock and together with shares of iac common stock held as of the date of this report by mr von furstenberg 58542 a trust for the benefit of certain members of mr dillers family 136711 and a family foundation 1711 represent approximately 431 of the total outstanding voting power of iac based on the number of shares of iac common stock outstanding on february 2 2018 as of the date of this report mr diller also holds 800000 vested options and 500000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

in addition pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iac’s chairman and senior executive and he beneficially owns within the meaning of rule 13d3 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended at least 5000000 shares of iac class b common stock andor common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest including iac securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelvemonth period 

as a result of iac securities beneficially owned by mr diller and certain members of his family mr diller and these family members are collectively currently in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge to successors and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness 

as of december 31 2017 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 21 billion including 13 billion and 275 million of total debt outstanding at match group and angi homeservices respectively as of that date we had borrowing availability of 300 million and match group had borrowing availability of 500 million under our respective revolving credit facilities neither match group angi homeservices nor any of their respective subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are currently subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness similarly neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries other than match group and its subsidiaries in the case of match group indebtedness and angi homeservices and its subsidiaries in the case of angi homeservices indebtedness guarantee any indebtedness of match group or angi homeservices nor are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness 

       the terms of the indebtedness of iac match group and angi homeservices could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition to our respective debt service obligations the operations of iac match group and angi homeservices require substantial investments on a continuing basis the ability of any of us to make scheduled debt payments to refinance indebtedness obligations and to fund capital and noncapital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses depends on our respective financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business competitive legal and other factors 

subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing certain indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness including additional unsecured and secured indebtedness although the terms of agreements governing certain indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant if we andor any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase 

also if an event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing the indebtedness of match group and angi homeservices contain similar restrictions see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial position liquidity and capital resourcesfinancial position 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 

the ability of iac match group and angi homeservices to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon among other things 



we cannot assure you that we match group of angi homeservices will generate sufficient cash flow from our respective operations or that we match group or angi homeservices will be able to otherwise take the actions described immediately above in amounts sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs see also we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries below 

if cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations sell equity andor negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt in order to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all the agreements governing the indebtedness of iac match group andor angi homeservices may restrict or market or business conditions may limit our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due 

we may not freely access the cash of match group angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries 

iacs potential sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of certain of our subsidiaries availability under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales including marketable securities the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or become subject the agreements governing the indebtedness of match group and angi homeservices limit their ability to pay dividends or make distributions loans or advances to stockholders including iac in addition because match group and angi homeservices are separate and distinct legal entities with public shareholders they have no obligation to provide us with funds whether by dividends distributions loans or other payments 

variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

as of december 31 2017 match group and angi homeservices had 425 million and 275 million respectively of indebtedness outstanding under their respective term loans borrowings under both term loans are and any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities of iac or match group will be at variable interest rates indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk match groups term loan bears interest at libor plus 250 and as of december 31 2017 the rate in effect was 385 if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the match group term loan would increase or decrease by 43 million the angi homeservices term loan bears interest at libor plus 200 and as of december 31 2017 the rate in effect was 338 if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the angi homeservices term loan would increase or decrease by 28 million see also item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

you may experience dilution with respect to your investment in iac and iac may experience dilution with respect to its investments in match group and angi homeservices as a result of compensatory equity awards 

we have issued various compensatory equity awards including stock options stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of our common stock as well as in equity of our various consolidated subsidiaries including match group and angi homeservices for more information regarding these awards and their impact on our diluted earnings per share calculation see note 13stockbased compensation and note 12earnings per share” respectively to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the issuance of shares of iac common stock in settlement of these equity awards could dilute your ownership interest in iac awards denominated in shares of match group or angi homeservices common stock that are settled in shares of those subsidiaries could dilute iac’s ownership interest in match group and angi homeservices respectively the dilution of our ownership stakes in match group andor angi homeservices could impact our ability among other things to maintain match group andor angi homeservices as part of our consolidated tax group for us federal income tax purposes to effect a taxfree distribution of our match group andor angi homeservices stakes to our stockholders or to maintain control of match group andor angi homeservices as we generally have the right to maintain our levels of ownership in match group 

and angi homeservices to the extent match group or angi homeservices issues additional shares of their respective capital stock in the future pursuant to investor rights agreements we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur 

with respect to awards denominated in shares of our nonpublicly traded subsidiaries we estimate the dilutive impact of those awards based on our estimated fair value of those subsidiaries those estimates may change from time to time and the fair value determined in connection with vesting and liquidity events could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation 

we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions andor not realize anticipated benefits following acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisitionrelated efforts 

even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 

 

 

 

 we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions including the combination in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions including the anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities we expect to realize as a result of the combination may not be realized also future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities lastly the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet particularly via mobile devices must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks including among others 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort can subject us to claims or other remedies and otherwise harm our business some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain in addition evolving internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention for example the us federal trade commission continues to monitor the use of paid search and online native advertising a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that could be viewed as similar to traditional editorial content to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our users specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover laws that adversely impact use or growth in use of the internet or that regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our online products and services could decrease user demand for our products and services increase costs or otherwise harm our business for example in december 2017 the us federal communications commission the fcc adopted an order reversing its may 2016 open internet order which codified network neutrality the principle that internet service providers should treat all data traveling through their networks the same not discriminating or charging differentially by content website platform or application as a result of this reversal broadband internet access providers now have more power to prioritize different types of internet traffic and set pricing which means they could discriminate against internet traffic of our businesses in favor of others by way of blocking or throttling traffic from our businesses paid prioritization of traffic through their networks generally or other similar actions andor charge us to provide our products and 

services via their networks if any of these actions were to occur our costs could increase and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

lastly the passage or adoption of any new or amended legislation or regulation affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments could harm our business for example the european union payment services directive which became effective in january 2018 and regulates payment services and payment service providers could restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to process autorenewal payments for as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing tiers to users who reside in the european union 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition as well as upon trade secrets we also rely to a lesser extent upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2038 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization andor laws or interpretations of laws regarding the enforceability of our existing intellectual property rights can change in an adverse manner the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive

principles of financial reporting 

iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of nongaap measure 

  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda  is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature and we believe that by excluding these items adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses 

for a reconciliation of operating income loss by reportable segment and net loss earnings attributable to iac shareholders to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 see  note 14—segment information  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  

noncash expenses that are excluded from nongaap measure 

  stockbased compensation   expense  consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions including the combination of stock options restricted stock units rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method however performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period upon the exercise of stock options and marketbased stock options the awards are gross settled and the vesting of rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards rsus the awards are settled on a net basis with the company remitting the required taxwithholding amount from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

  amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions including the combination at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as contractor and service professional relationships technology customer lists and user base content trade names and membership are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business

the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations the companys 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2017 by approximately 20 to 25 driven in part by higher capital expenditures for angi homeservices and match group related to the 

development of capitalized software to support our products and services and for angi homeservices new corporate headquarters partially offset by lower capital expenditures at corporate 

at december 31 2017 iac had 86 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time including without limitation market conditions share price and future outlook 

in may 2017 the board of directors of match group authorized match group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock match group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization 

the company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain nonpublicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries these equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events the value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries accordingly these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price these interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation the interests are ultimately settled in iac common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration these equity awards are settled on a net basis with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment the number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate the number of iac common shares that would be required to settle these interests other than for match group and angi homeservices subsidiaries at current estimated fair values including vested and unvested interests at december 31 2017  is 01 million  shares withholding taxes which will be paid by the company on behalf of the employees upon exercise would have been 152 million  at december 31 2017  assuming a 50 withholding rate

the company will not be required to pay the onetime transition tax under the tax act because of its net operating loss position the company does not expect to be a full us federal cash income tax payer until 2021 which is in line with previous estimates we expect the tax act to favorably impact our future liquidity primarily as a result of a reduction in the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability 

the company believes its existing cash cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements including capital expenditures debt service the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for netsettled stockbased awards and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future the companys liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services the company’s indebtedness could limit our ability to i obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements and ii use operating cash flow to make acquisitions 

capital expenditures invest in other areas such as developing business opportunities the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and as a result the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in  note 2—summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in  item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements 

acquisitions are an important part of the companys growth strategy the company invested 9121 million including the value of angi homeservices class a common stock issued in connection with the combination 361 million and 6507 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting units that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 

in connection with certain business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in “general and administrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is the companys largest asset with a carrying value of 26 billion  and 19 billion  at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 4591 million  and 3206 million   at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value in performing its annual assessment the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2017 a qualitative assessment of the match group angi homeservices vimeo and applications reporting units goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values th e primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below 

 the company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2017 the company 

quantitatively tested the daily burn and electus reporting units the companys quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value therefore the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired the companys publishing reporting unit has no goodwill 

the aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120 of their carrying values is approximately 450 million 

the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded 

the fair value of the companys reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed based on the reporting units current results and forecasted future performance as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the companys reporting units ranged from 125  to 175  in 2017 and 10  to 175  in 2016 determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies from the comparable companies a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use monetization model margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability the determination of fair value is based in part upon the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying values the companys policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 in 2017 the company did not quantitatively assess the angies list indefinitelived intangible assets acquired through the combination given the proximity of the september 29 2017 transaction date to the october 1 2017 annual test date the company determines the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 11  to 16  in both 2017 and 2016 and the royalty rates used ranged from 2  to 7  in both 2017 and 2016 

the 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments during the second quarter of 2016 the company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire 2754 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill and 116 million related to certain publishing indefinitelived intangible assets the 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the shoebuy reporting unit of 880 million and 141 million respectively  

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that these lives may be changed the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 5198 million and 3411 million at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the balance of deferred tax assets liabilities net is 313 million  and 2263 million  respectively 

the company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach recognition step one occurs when the company concludes that a tax position based solely on its technical merits is morelikelythannot to be sustainable upon examination measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the morelikelythannot threshold of being sustained this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes at december 31 2017 and 2016 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 397 million  and 410 million  including interest and penalties respectively we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

no income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of 1012 million at december 31 2017 the estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be 79 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt including current maturities 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which may consist of money market funds commercial paper treasury discount notes and shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2017 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than 01 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period however since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of 16 billion  was invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2017 the companys outstanding debt was 21 billion of which 14 billion  bears interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 727 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period the 425 million  match group term loan and the 275 million  angi homeservices term loan bear interest at variable rates the match group term loan bears interest at libor plus 250 as of december 31 2017 the rate in effect was 385  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the match group term loan would increase or decrease by 43 million the angi homeservices term loan bears interest at libor plus 200 as of december 31 2017 the rate in effect was 338  if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense on the angi homeservices term loan would increase or decrease by 28 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as a result is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp 

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 international revenue accounted for 30  26  and 26  respectively of our consolidated revenue the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar as a result as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of the statement of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results the average gbp and euro versus the us dollar exchange rate was approximately 5 higher and 2 lower respectively in 2017 compared to 2016 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses to the extent it or its subsidiaries conduct transactions in andor have assets andor liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 168 million  and gains of 344 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in gbp versus the us dollar during 2017 and the decrease in the gbp versus the us dollar during 2016 following the brexit vote on june 23 2016 generated the majority of the companys foreign currency exchange losses and gains in these years the 2017 losses and 2016 gains are primarily related to i us dollar denominated cash the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the pricerunner sale in march 2016 held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency and ii a us dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a 2016 acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency subsequent to december 31 2017 the company moved this us dollar denominated cash to a us dollar functional currency entity which will reduce the impact of foreign currency volatility on the companys future results of operations 

foreign currency exchange gains or losses historically have not been material to the company as a result historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exposures the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

competition 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand globally we compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products in addition to other online dating brands we compete indirectly with offline dating services such as in‑person matchmakers and social media platforms arguably our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors

partnerships 

through our partnerships business we work closely with partners in the software media and other industries to design and develop customized browser‑based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners’ products and services 

revenue 

substantially all of the applications segments revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers the substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our applications businesses are supplied to us by google inc google in the manner provided by and pursuant to a services agreement with google which expires on march 31 2020 the company may choose to terminate this agreement effective march 31 2019 

 pursuant to this agreement those of our applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our applications businesses and then clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us we recognize paid listing revenue from google when it delivers the users click in cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor we recognize the amount due from google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs see “item 1arisk factorswe depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations” 

to a significantly lesser extent the applications segments revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements

we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties competitors of our applications businesses include google yahoo 

bing and other third party browser extension convenience search and applications providers and other search technology and convenience service providers 

moreover some of the current and potential competitors of our applications businesses have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

we believe that the ability of our applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to

risk factors 

mr diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting andor investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock as a result mr diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 27 2017 mr diller his spouse diane von furstenberg and his stepson alexander von furstenberg collectively beneficially owned 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock and 136711 shares of iac common stock all of which were held in trusts for the benefit of mr diller and certain members of his family and 1711 shares of iac common stock held by a private foundation as of that date the shares of iac class b common stock beneficially owned by mr diller and certain members of his family collectively represented 100 of iac’s outstanding class b common stock and together with the shares of iac common stock also beneficially owned by these individuals represented approximately 447 of the total outstanding voting power of iac mr diller also holds 550000 vested options and 750000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

in addition pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iac’s chairman and senior executive and he beneficially owns within the meaning of rule 13d3 of the securities exchange act of 1934 at least 5000000 shares of iac class b common stock andor common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest including iac securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelvemonth period 

as a result of iac securities beneficially owned by mr diller and certain members of his family mr diller and these family members are collectively currently in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our publishing and applications properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services our current agreement with google expires on march 31 2020 the company may choose to terminate this agreement effective march 31 2019 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our publishing and applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase changes to the amount google charges to advertisers google’s paid listings network efficiency its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our publishing and applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services including with respect to which products and applications may access googles services and the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results across various platforms and products our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could if not cured result in google’s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners or the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of iac’s rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends particularly those that reduce advertising spending andor adversely impact consumer confidence could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue primarily revenue from our applications and publishing segments is attributable to online advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

similarly some of our businesses primarily homeadvisor are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior for example in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions consumer confidence spending levels and credit availability could be adversely affected the occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects which could result in a decrease in fees paid by home service professionals for consumer matches which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also experience turnover in our network of home services professionals given that a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses and as such are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior while these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long‑term agreements with them any turnover if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to our properties and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

we continue to compete with traditional advertising media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of mobile advertising the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to changes in laws changes in industry practices the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the distribution and use of our products and services depends in part on third parties 

we distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels for example as our users and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications we primarily in the case of match group’s dating business and apalon one of the businesses within our applications segment increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our mobile applications through their stores we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit or eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications if either or both of them did so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the use of certain of our products and services also depends in part on third parties for example users of match groups tinder dating product currently register for and log in to tinder exclusively through their facebook profiles while match group is currently in the process of developing an alternate authentication method that would allow users to register for and log into tinder using their mobile phone number no assurances can be provided that users will use this method versus registering for and logging into tinder through their facebook profiles facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit eliminate or 

otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook as an authentication method and if facebook did so and no alternate authentication method is available or the alternate method match group ultimately develops is not adopted by users match group’s and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly certain of the businesses within our applications and publishing segments have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search boxes browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either non‑exclusive and short‑term in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances in addition a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our partnerships business the inability of these businesses to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute search boxes browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various properties queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced content products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and that otherwise resonate with our users and customers 

we may not be able to convert traffic into repeat users and customers unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced content products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with our users and customers 

the development of new content products and services as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment require significant time and resources we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to these changes appropriately time the introduction of new content products and services or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner also these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites applications services and proprietary technologies obsolete our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately and efficiently could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition third parties could continue to develop technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our products and services generally otherwise make users less likely to use our products and services or interfere with the advertising efforts of our various businesses for example third parties have developed technologies that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products in addition third parties continue to introduce technologies including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use our failure to successfully modify our websites and products in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies or our failure to find alternative sources of revenue to support websites and products that currently generate revenue through advertising could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly while the continued introduction of new content products and services is critical to our success by definition new content products and services have limited operating histories which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our current business and future prospects for example through match group we seek to tailor each of our dating products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users building a given dating product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures although certain of our newer dating products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time the historical growth rates of these dating products are not necessarily an indicator of future growth rates for our newer dating products generally we have encountered and may continue to encounter risks and difficulties as we build new content brands and products the failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google and to a lesser extent microsoft and yahoo online display advertising and traditional offline advertising including television in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective historically we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and customers and sustain our growth 

in the case of paid advertising generally our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller publisher of advertising including through search engines and social networks and platforms or marketing affiliate as a result any such third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the case of any of our businesses in the future if this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel andor for a significant period of time our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers publishers of advertising or marketing affiliates our advertisements could be removed without notice andor our accounts could be suspended or terminated any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of our search engine marketing and optimization efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by google microsoft and yahoo without advance notice could adversely affect both the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally and how our websites rank within search results any or all of which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall 

certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization involving facebook and other social media platforms for example developing content designed to appear higher in a given facebook news feed and generate likes that involve challenges and risks similar to those faced in connection with our broader search engine marketing and optimization efforts also search engines continue to expand their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

separately evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of costeffective marketing opportunities for example as traditional television viewership declines and consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers the reach of many of traditional online and offline advertising channels is contracting to continue to reach potential users and customers we must continue to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels such as mobile and online video platforms as well as targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential former and current users via new virtual means generally the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to opportunities in traditional online and offline channels and if we are unable to continue to appropriately manage and fine‑tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various websites and mobile applications which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

communicating with our users via email is critical to our success and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

primarily in the case of match group’s dating business one of our primary means of communicating with users and customers and keeping them engaged with our products and services is via email as consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messagingsocial networking apps usage of email particularly among younger users and customers has declined in addition deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party email providers andor applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to our users and customers a continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users and customers via email could have an adverse impact on user and customer experience levels of user engagement and in the case of match group’s dating businesses the rate at which non‑paying users become paid members while we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our users and customers for example through push notifications we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will 

be as effective as email has been historically any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in part upon our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our emerging brands our brands and brandbuilding efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches moreover the failure to market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers andor the inability to adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices could adversely impact our various brands and brandbuilding efforts and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in various international markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union and as result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp during the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 26 of our total revenues were international revenues we translate international revenues into us dollardenominated operating results and during periods of a strengthening us dollar our international revenues will be reduced when translated into us dollars in addition as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of our international revenues into us dollardenominated operating results affects the periodoverperiod comparability of such results 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro since the average euro versus the us dollar exchange rate in 2016 was essentially flat compared to 2015 the translation of our international results into us dollars did not significantly reduce our revenue nor did it have a significant effect on the periodoverperiod comparability of our us dollardenominated operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 versus december 31 2015 to the extent that the us dollar continues to strengthen relative to the euro the translation of our international revenues into us dollars will reduce our us dollardenominated operating results and will affect their periodoverperiod comparability 

fluctuating foreign exchange rates can also result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses while foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the company the significant decline in the gbp due to the brexit vote on june 23 2016 generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency exchange risk 

historically we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies could adversely affect our future results of operations 

as the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases in order to maintain our profit margins we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  

as users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile solutions we increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications for example while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase paid memberships and certain à la carte features through these applications we determine the prices at which these memberships and features are sold and in exchange for facilitating the purchase of these memberships and features through these applications to users who download our applications from these stores we pay apple and google as applicable a share generally 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions as the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services while many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers users of and usage volumes on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets continue to increase relative to those of personal computers while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices and intend to continue to do so in the future we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our nonmobile products and services 

in addition the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and in turn our ability to attract advertisers our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of users and customers to mobile devices could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates if a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

through match group we own operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for and revenue generation from that product’s community of users in general the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands if a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable brands our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on the integrity and quality of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons furthermore fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption any such interruptions or outages regardless of the cause could negatively impact the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services tarnish our brands’ reputation and decrease demand for our products and services any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experiences of our users and customers accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our properties ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with changes in technology and user and customer preferences any failure to do so in a timely and costeffective manner could adversely affect the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services and could increase our costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data center service providers cloudbased web hosting services broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers changes in service levels provided by these systems or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions with users and customers if any of these events were to occur it could damage 

our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy 

we may not be able to protect our systems infrastructures and technologies from cyberattacks in addition we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties any disruption of our systems infrastructures and technologies or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information or other malicious activities events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems infrastructures and technologies as well as the products and services offered by our various businesses which could in turn adversely affect our users and customers the incidence of events of this nature or any combination thereof is on the rise worldwide 

while we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses and their respective systems infrastructures technologies products services users and customers and have invested and continue to invest heavily in these efforts and related training these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur that it will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems infrastructures and technologies andor those of our users and customers prevent us from providing our products and services compromise the integrity of our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities andor litigation that could result in liability to third parties even if we do not experience such events the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations could have a similar effect moreover even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services 

in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events 

if the security of personal and confidential user information including credit card information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event our reputation could be harmed and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential information including credit card information and enable our users to share their personal information with each other in some cases we retain third party vendors to store this information we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts if any such event were to occur we may not be able to remedy the event and we may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such an event and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring if a breach of our security or the security of our vendors and partners occurs the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed we could lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our various businesses accept payment from our users and customers primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers the ability of these businesses to access credit card information on a real time‑basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time they process a payment for products and services including auto‑renewal payments or payments for the purchase of a premium feature on or with any of our products or services is critical to our success 

when we experience or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards in the case of a breach experienced by a third party the more sizable the third party’s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted the more likely it is that our users and customers would be impacted by such a breach to the extent our users and customers are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party affected individuals would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals and even if we could new credit card information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users and customers are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user and customer effort 

additionally if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions we may face litigation fines governmental enforcement action civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures significantly higher credit card‑related costs and substantial remediation costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

finally the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge users and customers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including personal credit card data as well as private content such as videos and correspondence in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing storage use disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices regarding privacy generally and the sharing storage use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data these laws regulations standards and practices are changing inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations and new laws regulations standards and practices of this nature are adopted from time to time 

for example in 2016 the european commission i and the united states reached an agreement on a new framework for transfers of personal data the euus privacy shield which provides a safe harbor for us companies that transfer data from the eu to the us and ii adopted the general data protection regulation the gdpr a comprehensive european union privacy and data protection reform that will become effective in may 2018 and will supersede the european union data protection directive the eu directive currently in place the gdpr imposes stricter standards regarding the sharing storage use disclosure and protection of end user data and increased penalties for noncompliance relative to the eu directive in addition the potential exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling our personal data of users located in the united kingdom in addition there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the us including in various states and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 

while we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations standard and practices that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance moreover any failure or perceived failure by us or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information to comply with applicable privacy laws privacy policies or privacy‑related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information could result in governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity in the case of such an event our reputation may be harmed we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate particularly the gdpr could be costly particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope more commonplace and continue to evolve if these costs are significant our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness 

as of december 31 2016 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 16 billion including 12 billion of total debt outstanding at match group as of this date we had borrowing availability of 300 million and match group had borrowing availability of 500 million under our respective revolving credit facilities neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness similarly neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries other than match group and its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of match group or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness 

our indebtedness and match groups indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 in addition to our respective debt service obligations our and match group’s operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis our ability or the ability of match group to make scheduled debt payments to refinance obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non‑capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses depends on our respective financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business competitive legal and other factors 

subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness although the terms of agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant if new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the risks described above could increase also in the event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing match groups indebtedness contain similar restrictions see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial position liquidity and capital resourcesfinancial position 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 

our ability and the ability of match group to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

 there can be no assurance that we or match group will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we or match group will be able to draw under our respective revolving credit agreements or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs see also we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries below 

if cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations sell equity andor negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt in order to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all the agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness may restrict or market or business conditions may limit our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due 

we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries 

the companys potential sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries availability under iacs revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales including marketable securities the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject agreements governing match groups indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions loans or advances to stockholders including iac in addition because match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with public shareholders it has no obligation to provide us with funds for payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or other payments 

you may experience dilution with respect to your investment in iac and iac may experience dilution with respect to its investment in match group as a result of the settlement of equity awards 

  

our dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock restricted stock unit awards and vested and unvested stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries including tinder and other match group subsidiaries “subsidiary awards” for more information regarding subsidiary awards see note 13stockbased compensation to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

  

these dilutive securities are reflected in our share calculations underlying our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 12earnings per share” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8consolidated financial statements and supplementary data intraquarter movements in our stock price as well as variances between the estimated fair value of our subsidiaries used to calculate such fullydiluted share calculations which estimated fair value may change from timetotime and quartertoquarter and the fair value determined in connection with the liquidity events related to subsidiary awards could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations 

the issuance of shares of iac common stock in settlement of subsidiary awards could dilute your ownership interest in iac subsidiary awards related to match group subsidiaries may be settled in shares of iac common stock or match group common stock at our option in the event we elect to settle these match group subsidiary awards in shares of match group common stock rather than in shares of iac common stock our ownership stake in match group would be diluted this dilution could impact our ability among other things to maintain match group as part of our consolidated tax group for us federal income tax purposes to effect a taxfree distribution of our match group stake to our stockholders or to maintain control of match group as we generally have the right to maintain our level of ownership in match group to the extent match group issues additional shares of its capital stock in the future pursuant to an investor rights agreement we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur 

in addition to the dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of iac common stock or match group common stock in settlement of subsidiary equity awards the holders of the subsidiary equity awards may choose to sell the shares of iac common stock or match group common stock they receive in settlement of their subsidiary awards into the open market immediately if sales are significant and concentrated they could have a temporary impact on the trading value of our stock or on match group common stock 

variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

match group currently has 350 million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan borrowings under the term loan are and any borrowings under match groups revolving credit facility will be at variable rates of interest indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk match groups term loan bears interest at libor plus 325 as of december 31 2016 the rate in effect was 420 if libor were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest and expense payments on the outstanding balance as of december 31 2016 on the term loan would have increased by 35 million if libor were to decrease by 100 basis points then the effective interest rate would decrease by 20 basis points to the libor floor of 075 and the annual interest expense and payments in the current year would decrease by 07 million see also item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisitionrelated efforts 

even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet particularly via mobile devices must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks these additional risks include among others 

 the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain in addition evolving internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention for example the us federal trade commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover laws that regulate the practices of third parties may also adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations for example the open internet order adopted by the us federal communications commission the fcc in may 2016 codified network neutrality the principle that internet service providers should treat all data traveling 

through their networks the same not discriminating or charging differentially by content website platform or application the open internet orders rules could be vacated by the courts in connection with a legal challenge to the fccs authority to adopt the order repealed by the fcc or overruled by the us congress if this were to occur broadband internet access providers could discriminate against internet traffic of our businesses in favor of others or charge our businesses to provide their services to users and consumers via their networks which could increase our costs and would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition as well as upon trade secrets we also rely to a lesser extent upon patented and patent‑pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2038 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business the company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation involving property personal injury contract intellectual property and other claims the amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage 

rules of the securities and exchange commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the registrants business to which the registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve claims for damages for amounts exclusive of interest and costs not exceeding 10 of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in the judgment of company management none of the pending litigation matters that the company and its subsidiaries are defending including those described below involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude the litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the rules of the securities and exchange commission 

delaware law class action litigation against iac 

on november 21 2016 following the company’s announcement in its definitive proxy statement of a proposal to adjust the company’s capital structure by adopting an amendment and restatement of the company’s certificate of incorporation the “new certificate” to establish a new class of nonvoting capital stock which would be known as class c common stock and potentially declaring and paying a dividend of one share of the class c common stock for each outstanding share of iac common stock and class b common stock the “dividend” and together with the adoption of the new certificate the “class c issuance” a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the delaware court of chancery against the company and its board of directors purportedly on behalf of the company’s stockholders see miller et al v iacinteractivecorp et al  ca no 12929vcl del ch ct the lawsuit generally alleged among other things that iac’s directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed class c issuance inasmuch as it was allegedly designed to unduly benefit the company’s chairman and senior executive barry diller in respect of his alleged voting control of the company and would harm iac’s public stockholders among other remedies the lawsuit sought to enjoin the filing of the new certificate with the delaware secretary of state as well as unspecified money damages 

on november 22 2016 and december 12 2016 two additional putative class action lawsuits were filed in the delaware court of chancery against the company and its board of directors purportedly on behalf of the company’s stockholders and asserting substantially similar allegations claims and remedies as in the miller  lawsuit see halberstam v bronfman et al  ca no 12935vcl del ch ct and california public employees’ retirement system v iacinteractivecorp et al  no 12975vcl del ch ct all three lawsuits have been consolidated as in re iacinteractivecorp class c reclassification litigation  no 12975vcl and the court has designated the calpers complaint as the operative complaint in the case and established a case schedule on january 23 2017 and february 3 2017 the defendants filed answers denying the material allegations of the complaint the case is currently in discovery 

while the class c issuance was approved at the companys 2016 annual meeting of stockholders the company has agreed not to effect the class c issuance during the pendency of the lawsuit described immediately above and the delaware court of chancery has been so informed 

we believe that this lawsuit and the material allegations and claims therein are without merit and intend to continue to defend against them vigorously

 management overview 

iac is a leading media and internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands such as homeadvisor vimeo dictionarycom the daily beast investopedia and match groups online dating portfolio which includes match tinder plentyoffish and okcupid 

sources of revenue 

match groups dating revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time and the balances from à la carte features where users pay a fee for a specific action or event with additional revenue generated from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences nondating revenue is primarily earned from fees received directly from students for inperson and online test preparation classes access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services 

homeadvisors revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and memberships 

a significant portion of the revenue from our applications and publishing segments is derived from online advertising most of which is attributable to our services agreement with google inc google the companys service agreement became effective on april 1 2016 following the expiration of the previous services agreement the services agreement expires on march 31 2020 however the company may choose to terminate the agreement effective march 31 2019 the services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  revenue earned from google was 8244 million  13 billion  and 14 billion  respectively for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  google revenue represents 87 and 73 94 and 83 and 97 and 83 of applications and publishing revenue respectively 

the revenue earned by our video segment is derived from media production and distribution subscriptions and advertising 

shoebuys revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales pricerunners revenue was derived principally from advertising 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising 

a meaningful portion of the companys revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  revenue earned from google represents 26 40 and 45 respectively of our consolidated revenue 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our partnerships customized browserbased applications integrate our paid listings into their websites and fees related to the distribution and facilitation of inapp purchases of product features we also pay to market and distribute our services on thirdparty distribution channels such as search engines and social media websites in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline thirdparty distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iacs businesses operate increases

  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda  is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets if applicable and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature and we believe that by excluding these items adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses 

for a reconciliation of operating income loss by reportable segment and net loss earnings attributable to iac shareholders to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 14—segment information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  stockbased compensation   expense  consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options restricted stock units rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method however performancebased rsus and marketbased awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market conditions has been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus performancebased rsus and marketbased awards the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required taxwithholding amount from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or in the case of leasehold improvements the lease term if shorter 

  amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as trade names content technology customer lists advertiser and supplier relationships are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business 

effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue 

the impact of foreign exchange rates on match group due to its global reach may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in rates is significant international revenues are favorably 

impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of revenue excluding foreign exchange in addition to reported revenue helps improve the ability to understand match groups performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match groups core operating results 

  

revenue excluding foreign exchange impact compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period revenue excluding foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact expressed as a percentage is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates 

this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap 

the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue was not material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations iac has a 300 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7 2020 match group has a 500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7 2020 at december 31 2016 there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility or the match group credit facility 

at december 31 2016 iac had 93 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time including without limitation market conditions share price and future outlook 

iacs consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 were 13 billion of which 2537 million was held by match group the company generated 2924 million  of operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 of which 2341 million was generated by match group match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds as a result we cannot freely access the cash of the match group and its subsidiaries in addition agreements governing match groups indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders including the company in the event a default has occurred or match groups leverage ratio as defined in the indentures exceeds 50 to 10 

the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations the companys 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2016 by approximately 5 to 10 driven in part by certain corporate related expenditures and homeadvisors sales center and corporate headquarters expansion 

awards made under our subsidiary denominated equity plans are settled on a net basis with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries may be settled in either iac shares or match group shares at our option the tax withholding payment associated with these awards is made by the company in cash on behalf of the employee at the time these awards are exercised in the case of match group awards the tax withholding payment is made by match group in cash at the time these awards are exercised in either case the cash tax withholding payments will vary based on the ultimate number of awards exercised the intrinsic value of the awards upon exercise and relevant withholding tax rates we expect a reduction in future corporate income taxes equal to a substantial portion of any such withholding tax payments by virtue of the income tax deduction we will recognize based on the intrinsic value of the awards at exercise however there may be some delay in the timing of the realization of the cash benefit of the income tax deduction because it will be dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and the timing of estimated income tax payments as it relates to awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries if the company elects to settle these awards in iac shares we will receive match group shares equal in value to the iac shares issued if the company elects to settle these awards in match group shares our ownership interest in match group will be diluted the match group subsidiary denominated equity plan at tinder has a number of scheduled option exercise periods and the next period is in may 2017 the company expects to settle a sufficient number of exercises in iac shares to maintain an economic interest in match group of at least 80 see note 13—stockbased compensation to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of subsidiary denominated equity plans 

the company believes its existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements including capital expenditures debt service the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for netsettled stockbased awards and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future the companys liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services the company’s indebtedness could limit our ability to i obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements and ii use operating cash flow to make acquisitions capital expenditures invest in other areas such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities in 

the event a default has occurred or in certain circumstances our leverage ratio as defined in the indenture exceeds 30 to 10 the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and as a result the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from these estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements 

acquisitions are an important part of the companys growth strategy the company invested 184 million 6174 million and 2594 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting units that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 

 in connection with certain business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in “general and administrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see note 8—fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is the companys largest asset with a carrying value of 19 billion  and 22 billion  at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks have a carrying value of 3206 million  and 3801 million   at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value in performing its annual assessment the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2016 a qualitative assessment of the match group homeadvisor domestic homeadvisor international vimeo daily burn and shoebuy reporting units goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values th e primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below 



 when the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value goodwill must be tested for impairment for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2016 the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the applications and connected ventures reporting units were greater than their respective carrying values and performed a quantitative test of these reporting units the companys quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value therefore the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired the publishing reporting unit had no goodwill as of october 1 2016 because the company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire 2754 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill during the second quarter of 2016 which is more fully described below following a quantitative impairment test as of june 30 2016 the quantitative impairment test is performed using the twostep process described below 

the first step of an annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill the fair value of the companys reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent forecast and budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed based on the reporting units current results and forecasted future performance as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the companys reporting units ranged from 10  to 175 in 2016  and 12  to 22  in 2015 determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies from the comparable companies a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use monetization model margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability the determination of fair value is based in part upon the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the company has adopted the provisions of accounting standards update no 201704 intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  effective january 1 2017 therefore any goodwill impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based solely upon the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above will no longer be performed 

at october 1 2016 the fair value of each of the companys reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible asset are less than its carrying value the companys policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 the company determines the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty 

dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 11  to 16  in both 2016 and 2015 and the royalty rates used ranged from 2 to 7 in 2016 and 1  to 9  in 2015 

while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments during the second quarter of 2016 the company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire 2754 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill and 116 million related to certain publishing indefinitelived intangible assets the 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the shoebuy reporting unit of 880 million and 141 million respectively  these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014—operating income loss and note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

recoverability and estimated useful lives of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment including leasehold improvements and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value in addition the company reviews the useful lives of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 3411 million and 3635 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 2263 million and 3468 million respectively 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 410 million and 434 million including interest respectively changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

no income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating 6802 million  at december 31 2016 the estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings would be 1693 million

71 million respectively the company also issues rsus and performancebased rsus for rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt including current maturities 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist of money market funds commercial paper treasury discount notes and shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established during 2016 the company did not record any material otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2016 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by 01 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period however since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of 13 billion  was invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2016 the companys outstanding debt was 16 billion  including 200 million of 2013 senior notes classified as current pending redemption of which 13 billion bears interest at fixed rates and 350 million match group term loan which bears interest at a variable rate if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 539 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period the match group term loan bears interest at libor plus 325 as of december 31 2016 the rate in effect was 420 if libor were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest expense and payments on the match group term loan would increase by 35 million if libor were to decrease by 100 basis points the effective interest rate would decrease by 20 basis points to the libor floor of 075 and the annual interest expense and payments in the current year would decrease by 07 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound gbp 

for both the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 international revenue accounted for 26 of consolidated revenue the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statements of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results the average euro versus the us dollar exchange rate was essentially flat in 2016 compared to 2015 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses included in the companys earnings for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 are gains and losses of 344 million  54 million  and 16 million  respectively historically foreign currency exchange gains and losses have not been material to the company however the significant decline in the gbp due to the brexit vote on june 23 2016 generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during 2016 this gain is primarily related to 1 us dollar denominated cash the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the pricerunner sale in march 2016 held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency and 2 a us dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a recent acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a gbp functional currency 

if the gbp had declined 10 further versus the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2016 the gain would have been greater by 20 million and if the gbp had declined 10 less versus the us dollar the gain would have been reduced by 26 million 

historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exposures our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

description of iac businesses 

match group 

overview 

our match group segment includes the dating and nondating businesses of match group inc “match group” which completed its initial public offering on november 24 2015 as of december 31 2015 iac’s ownership interest and voting interest in match group were 846 and 982 respectively 

services 

dating  through match group we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio with over 45 brands available in 38 languages and offered in over 190 countries including the following key brands match okcupid plentyoffish tinder meetic twoo ourtime blackpeoplemeet and friendscout24 we operate a north america dating business which includes match chemistry people media plentyoffish okcupid tinder and other dating businesses operating within the united states and canada and an international dating business which includes meetic the international operations of plentyoffish and tinder and all other dating businesses operating outside of the united states and canada 

all of our dating products enable a user to establish a profile and review other people’s profiles without charge each of them also offers additional features some of which are free and some of which require payment depending on the particular product in general access to premium features requires a paid membership which is typically offered in packages from one month to 12 months depending on the product and circumstance prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of membership purchased by the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and by whether or not a customer is taking advantage of any special offers in addition to paid memberships many of our dating products such as match meetic and okcupid offer users the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other members and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use basis the precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution 

nondating in addition to our dating business we also operate a non‑dating business through match group’s ownership of the princeton review which provides a variety of educational test preparation academic tutoring and college counseling services the princeton review includes tutorcom acquired in 2012 and the princeton review acquired in 2014 

revenue 

substantially all of the match group segment’s revenue is attributable to the dating business and substantially all dating revenue is derived directly from users the significant majority of that revenue comes from recurring membership fees which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time and the balance from à la carte features where users pay a fee for a specific action or event each brand offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its unique community in addition to direct revenue from users dating revenue is derived from online advertising substantially all of nondating revenue is derived directly from students 

marketing 

we attract the majority of users of our dating products through word‑of‑mouth and other free channels in addition many of our brands rely on paid customer acquisition for a significant percentage of their users our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing banner and other display advertising search engine marketing email campaigns and business development or partnership deals our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts as well as events 

competition 

the dating industry is competitive and has no single dominant brand we compete primarily with other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products including eharmony spark networks jdate christianmingle zoosk parship elitepartner e‑darling and badoo 

in addition to other online dating brands we compete indirectly with offline dating services such as in‑person matchmakers and social media platforms arguably our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors

 revenue 

the publishing segments revenue consists principally of advertising revenue which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries display advertisements and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications the substantial majority of the paid listings that our publishing businesses display are supplied to us by google pursuant to our services agreement with google 

pursuant to this agreement those of our publishing businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our publishing businesses and then clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us we recognize paid listing revenue from google when it delivers the users click in cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor we recognize the amount due from google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs see “item 1arisk factorswe depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations” 

competition

moreover some of the current and potential competitors of our publishing businesses have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us

risk factors 

mr diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting andor investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock as a result mr diller and his family are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 29 2016 mr diller owned 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock and 136711 shares of iac common stock as of this date mr diller had sole voting and sole investment power with respect to these iac securities and the shares of iac class b common stock held by mr diller represented 100 of iac’s outstanding class b common stock and together with the shares of iac common stock held by mr diller represented approximately 429 of the total outstanding voting power of iac mr diller also holds 300000 vested options and 1000000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

as discussed in “item 1businessequity ownership and vote” on february 22 2016 in connection with the longterm estate planning of mr diller and his family mr diller transferred all of his iac class b and common stock holdings to the 2016 grats and the 2016 family trust each of mr diller and ms von furstenberg has sole voting and investment power respectively over the iac securities in the 2016 grats and mr von furstenberg has sole voting and sole investment power over the iac securities in the family trust 

in addition pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iac’s chairman and senior executive and he beneficially owns within the meaning of rule 13d3 of the securities exchange act of 1934 at least 5000000 shares of iac class b common stock andor iac common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest including by way of sole investment power over the iac securities in the 2016 grats he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve‑month period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr diller’s sole investment power over the iac securities in the 2016 grats ms von furstenberg’s sole voting power over the iac securities in the 2016 grats mr von furstenberg’s sole voting and sole investment power over the iac securities in the 2016 family trust and mr diller’s contractual rights described above mr diller and his family are collectively currently in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our publishing and applications properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services our current agreement with google expires on march 31 2016 following the expiration of this agreement a new services agreement with google which expires on march 31 2020 will take effect the company may choose to terminate this agreement effective march 31 2019 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our publishing and applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase changes to the amount google charges to advertisers google’s paid listings network efficiency its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our publishing and applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services including with respect to which products and applications may access googles services and the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results across various platforms and products our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could if not cured result in google’s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners or the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of iac’s rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends particularly those that reduce advertising spending andor adversely impact consumer confidence could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue primarily revenue from our publishing and applications segments is attributable to online advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

similarly some of our businesses primarily homeadvisor are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior for example in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions consumer confidence spending levels and credit availability could be adversely affected the occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects which could result in a decrease in fees paid by home service professionals for consumer matches which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also experience turnover in our network of home services professionals given that a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses and as such are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior any turnover if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to our properties and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

we continue to compete with traditional advertising media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of mobile 

advertising the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to changes in laws changes in industry practices the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon third parties to drive traffic to our various properties and distribute our products and services 

our success depends in part upon third parties driving traffic to our various properties desktop and mobile and distributing our products and services 

we distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels for example certain of the businesses within our publishing and applications segments have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search boxes toolbars browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either non‑exclusive and short‑term in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances in addition a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our partnerships business the inability of these businesses to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute search boxes toolbars browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various properties queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition as our users and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications we primarily in the case of match group’s dating business and apalon one of the businesses within our applications segment increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our mobile applications through their stores we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit or eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications if either or both of them did so our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in connection with our search engine optimization or seo efforts we rely on third party search engines to drive traffic to our various properties desktop and mobile seo efforts involve developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of search results if we fail to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations certain of our businesses engage in similar efforts involving facebook and other social media platforms for example developing content designed to appear higher in a given facebook news feed and generate likes that involve challenges and risks similar to those faced in connection with our seo efforts 

also search engines continue to expand their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly we rely on facebook to distribute one of match groups dating products tinder users currently register for and log in to tinder exclusively through their facebook profiles facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform in this manner and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook in this manner and if facebook did so match group’s and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as discussed below under marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective and communicating with our users via email is critical to our success and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our traffic building initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new content products services and enhancements infrastructure 

and other related efforts and are dependent in part on our ability to effectively communicate with our users and customers via current and new means of communication 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced content products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and that otherwise resonate with our users and customers 

even if we succeed in our traffic building and distribution efforts we may not be able to convert traffic into repeat users and customers unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced content products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with our users and customers 

the development of new content products and services as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment require significant time and resources we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to these changes appropriately time the introduction of new content products and services or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner also these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites applications services and proprietary technologies obsolete our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately and efficiently could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of certain of our applications third parties have introduced and continue to introduce technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services such as through the introduction of features andor processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use our services relative to those of our competitors for example third parties continue to introduce technologies including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use in addition there are technologies that interfere with the functionality of or settings changes made by our applications for example there are technologies that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users these technologies applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications which in turn adversely impacts our revenues 

technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products our failure to successfully modify our websites and products in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies or our failure to find alternative sources of revenue to support websites and products that currently generate revenue through advertising could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in a costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new content products or services to the market in response to such changes our inability to provide quality content products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example in the case of aboutcom  we rely on independent freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users if we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally andor the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a costeffective manner the experience of our users would be adversely affected which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly while the continued introduction of new content products and services is critical to our success by definition new content products and services have limited operating histories which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our current business and future prospects for example through match group we seek to tailor each of our dating products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users building a given dating product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures although certain of our newer dating products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time the historical growth rates of these dating products are not necessarily an indicator of future growth rates for our newer dating products generally we have encountered and may continue to encounter risks and difficulties as we build new content brands and products the failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google and to a lesser extent microsoft and yahoo online display advertising and traditional offline advertising including television in connection with these initiatives 

which may not be successful or costeffective historically we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and customers and sustain our growth 

in the case of paid advertising generally our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller publisher of advertising including through search engines and social networks and platforms or marketing affiliate as a result any such third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example providers of online search advertising services including google microsoft and yahoo may limit our ability to market our products and services through their advertising services whether due to their policies competitive reasons or otherwise other publishers and channels have from time to time limited or prohibited advertisements for match groups dating products for a variety of reasons including as a result of poor behavior by other dating industry participants we cannot assure you that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the case of our dating or any of our other businesses in the future if this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel andor for a significant period of time our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers publishers of advertising or marketing affiliates our advertisements could be removed without notice andor our accounts could be suspended or terminated any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by google microsoft and yahoo without advance notice could adversely affect both the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall 

separately evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of costeffective marketing opportunities for example as traditional television viewership declines and consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers the reach of many of traditional online and offline advertising channels is contracting to continue to reach potential users and customers we must continue to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels such as mobile and online video platforms generally the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to opportunities in traditional online and offline channels and if we are unable to continue to appropriately manage and fine‑tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition as the distribution of our products and services through certain channels increases in order to maintain our profit margins we may need to offset increasing related fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures which could adversely affect our marketing efforts and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations as discussed above as our user and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications we primarily match group’s dating business increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications for example while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores we offer our users the opportunity to purchase paid memberships and certain à la carte features through these applications we determine the prices at which these memberships and features are sold and in exchange for facilitating the purchase of these memberships and features through these applications to users who download our applications from these stores we pay apple and google as applicable a share currently 30 of the revenue we receive from these transactions as the distribution of our dating and other products and services through app stores increases we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally or our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various websites and mobile applications which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

communicating with our users via email is critical to our success and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

as consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messagingsocial networking apps usage of email particularly among our younger users and customers has declined in addition deliverability restrictions imposed by third party email providers could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to our users and customers primarily in the case of match group’s dating business one of our primary means of communicating with users and customers and keeping them engaged with our products and services is via email any erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users and customers via email could have an adverse impact on user and customer experience and in the case of match group’s dating businesses the rate at which non‑paying users become paid members while we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our users and customers for example through push notifications we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as email has been historically any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of highlyrecognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries as well as a number of fledgling brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in part upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our fledgling brands our brands and brandbuilding efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches moreover the failure to market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers andor the inability to adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices could adversely impact our various brands and brandbuilding efforts and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in various international markets primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union during the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2015 approximately 31 and 26 of our total revenue respectively were international revenue our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro 

as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate the translation of our international results into us dollars affects the period‑over‑period comparability of our us dollar‑denominated operating results historically we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures our international operations’ continued growth and expansion into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services while many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers users of and usage volumes on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets continue to increase relative to those of personal computers while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices and intend to continue to do so in the future we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our nonmobile products and services 

in addition the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and in turn our ability to attract advertisers our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of users and customers to mobile devices could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates if a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

through match group we own operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for and revenue generation from that product’s community of users in general the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands if a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable brands our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on the integrity and quality of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons furthermore fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption any such interruptions or outages regardless of the cause could negatively impact the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services tarnish our brands’ reputation and decrease demand for our products and services any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experiences of our users and customers accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our properties and to keep up with changes in technology and user and customer preferences any failure to do so in a timely and costeffective manner could adversely affect the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services and could increase our costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

for example we are currently in the process of an ongoing consolidation and streamlining of the technology and network systems and infrastructures of a number of our dating businesses including match ourtime and meetic the goal of this project is to modernize optimize and improve the scalability and cost‑effectiveness of these systems and infrastructures and to increase our ability to deploy product changes more rapidly across devices and product lines we have budgeted significant human and financial resources for these efforts and if we experience delays inefficiencies andor operational failures we will incur additional costs which would adversely affect our profitability moreover these efforts may not be successful may not be completed in a timely or cost‑effective manner may not result in the cost savings or other benefits we anticipate and may disrupt operations any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations 

any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers changes in service levels provided by these systems or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions with users and customers if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy 

we may not be able to protect our systems infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks in addition we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties any disruption of our systems infrastructures and technologies or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyber attacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information or other malicious activities the incidence of events of this nature or any combination thereof is on the rise worldwide 

while we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses and have invested heavily in these efforts and related training these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur that it will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore we may become the victim of security breaches such as the misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of user customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations which could have a similar effect on us 

any cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as result in a degradation of our products and services andor cause damage to our systems infrastructures technologies and data even if we do not experience such events the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations could have a similar effect moreover even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services 

in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events 

if the security of personal and confidential user information including credit card information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event our reputation could be harmed and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we receive process store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential information including credit card information and enable our users to share their personal information with each other in some cases we retain third party vendors to store this information we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of this information but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts if any such event were to occur we may not be able to remedy the event and we may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such an event and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring if a breach of our security or the security of our vendors and partners occurs the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed we could lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers the ability of these businesses to access credit card information on a real time‑basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time they process a payment for products and services including auto‑renewal payments or payments for the purchase of a premium feature on or with any of our products or services is critical to our success 

when we experience or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards in the case of a breach experienced by a third party the more sizable the third party’s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach to the extent our users are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party affected users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users and even if we could some users’ new credit card information may 

not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user effort 

additionally if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions we may face fines governmental enforcement action civil liability diminished public perception of our security measures significantly higher credit card‑related costs and substantial remediation costs any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

finally the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge consumers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including personal credit card data as well as private content such as videos and correspondence in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices regarding privacy generally and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data examples include the european union data protection directive as adopted and implemented by the various european union member states the eu directive various us state regulations concerning minimum data security standards industry selfregulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections and related compliance obligations regarding privacy and data security 

in addition if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy it could become subject to an investigation andor proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the us federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act andor brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law as well as a private lawsuit under various us federal and state laws similarly in the european union the online service provider could become subject to an investigation andor proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws as well as private causes of action under the eu directive in general personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world particularly in the european union the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

us and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security for example in january 2016 the us federal trade commission released a report that further explored the use of “big data” and its impact on american consumers this report followed the may 2014 white house release of a review of big data practices which called for an update to us privacy laws based on the proposed consumer privacy bill of rights released by the white house in february 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law in addition in february 2013 the us federal trade commission issued a report seeking changes in internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures similarly new privacy laws and regulations at the state level as well as new laws and directives abroad particularly in the european union are being proposed and implemented for example effective january 1 2016 the delaware online privacy and protection act requires companies to make new and enhanced disclosures regarding their privacy policies and since 2014 california law has required companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals 

the european union is in the process of adopting new guidelines the proposed european data protection regulation for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments which will supersede the eu directive in addition in october 2015 the european union’s highest court ruled that the euus safe harbor agreement which had provided a framework for transfers of personal data from european union member states to the united states was invalid in february 2016 the european commission and the united states reached an agreement on a proposed new framework for transfers of personal data the euus privacy shield this proposed new framework is expected to impose a stricter compliance regime for companies seeking to transfer personal data from european union member states to the united states and require stronger monitoring by us regulators of the sharing use disclosure and protection of such data and related enforcement for noncompliance it currently remains unclear how we and other us companies should proceed when 

transferring personal data from european union member states to the united states given that the euus privacy shield is not yet final and faces hurdles to adoption and the european commission did not provide any interim guidance 

in addition existing privacy laws that were intended for brickandmortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses andor limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities such as targeted advertising which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches in the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with payment card industry pci data security standards moreover any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally which would decrease traffic to and in turn usage and transactions on the relevant website andor our various websites and which in turn could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies federal state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or pci standards as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

while we believe that we comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations standard and practices or that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims any failure or perceived failure by us or the third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information to comply with applicable privacy laws privacy policies or privacy‑related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions significant fines litigation claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity in the case of such an event our reputation may be harmed we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished any or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries 

the companys potential sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries availability under iacs revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales including marketable securities the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject agreements governing match groups indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions loans or advances to stockholders including iac in addition because match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with public shareholders it has no obligation to provide us with funds for payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or other payments 

our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness 

as of december 31 2015 we had total debt outstanding of approximately 18 billion including 12 billion of total debt outstanding at match group 40 million of which matures in the current year as of this date we had borrowing availability of 300 million and match group had borrowing availability of 500 million under our respective revolving credit facilities neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness similarly neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries other than match group and its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of match group or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness 

our indebtedness and match groups indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 22 

   

in addition to our respective debt service obligations our and match group’s operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis our ability or the ability of match group to make scheduled debt payments to refinance obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non‑capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses depends on our respective financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business competitive legal and other factors 

  

subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness although the terms of agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant if new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the risks described above could increase 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 

our ability and the ability of match group to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

   

there can be no assurance that our business or match group will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we or match group will be able to draw under our respective revolving credit agreements or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs see also we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries above   

if cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations sell equity andor negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt in order to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all the agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness may restrict or market or business conditions may limit our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due 

agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business 

  

the agreements governing our and match group’s indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness would likely contain a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and match group including restrictions on the ability to among other things 

   

any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing current or future indebtedness upon a default unless waived lenders under our respective credit agreements could elect to terminate their commitments cease making further loans foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our indebtedness and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation holders of our or match group’s senior notes also have the ability to force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in certain circumstances subject to the terms of the related indentures in addition a default could trigger a cross default under our other agreements and could trigger a cross default under agreements governing our future indebtedness our operating results may not generate cash in an amount that would be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements 

variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

at december 31 2015 match group has 800 million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan facility which bears interest at variable rates and currently bears interest at libor plus 450 with a libor floor of 100  libor at december 31 2015 for similar borrowings of three months was approximately 60 basis points changes in the interest rates applicable to this indebtedness will expose us to interest rate risk for example if libor were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest payments on this indebtedness would increase by 60 basis points or 48 million in 2016 and if libor decreased 60 basis points to zero annual interest payments on this indebtedness would remain the same such potential changes in interest payments take into account quarterly amortization payments and are based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant rate of variablerate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period to the extent that we or match group draw down on our respective revolving credit facilities in the future any related indebtedness incurred would bear interest at variable rates which would increase our exposure to interest rate risk see also item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisitionrelated efforts 

even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of 

contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks these additional risks include among others 

 the occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect our international operations which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 

for example through our various businesses we post and link to third party content including third party advertisements links and websites we also allow users to submit content such as comments photographs and videos we could be subject to liability for posting hosting or linking to third party content and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights some laws including the communications decency act or cda and the digital millennium copyright act or dmca limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content for example the dmca generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied however the scope and applicability of the dmca are subject to judicial interpretation and as such remain uncertain and the us congress may enact legislation affecting and potentially limiting the protections afforded by the dmca to online service providers moreover similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate as a result claims have been and could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting among other things negligence defamation invasion of privacy or right or publicity copyright infringement or trademark infringement 

also we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses as well as develop market andor distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our consumer and partnerships businesses which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications for example canada’s antispam legislation “casl” which became effective on july 1 2014 prohibits all commercial electronic messages including email text social media sound and image messages that are sent without proper consumer consent and effective january 15 2015 the casl restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications while several canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for casl violations effective july 1 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for casl violations 

in addition changing internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention one example of such changing practices is the increasing use of “native” advertising a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content the us federal trade commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers 

lastly one of the businesses within our applications segment slimware operates a paid telephone technical support service which it promotes in part through its software products in the recent past and currently the us federal trade commission and various state regulatory agencies and attorneys general have been aggressively enforcing laws governing telephonic sales in the computer support industry while slimware has put a related compliance program in place with the third party vendor who provides paid telephone technical support services on its behalf to ensure compliance with applicable laws no assurances can be given that this program will be effective 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition as well as upon trade secrets we also rely to a lesser extent upon patented and patent‑pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2034 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline thirdparty distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iacs businesses operate increases

reduction in fair value the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due primarily to the modification of certain equity awards in the current year period a higher number of forfeited awards in the prior year and issuance of equity awards since the prior year the goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of october 1 2015 the date of our most recent annual assessment the increase in gains in acquisitionrelated contingent consideration fair value adjustments was the result of an update of the future forecast of earnings and operating metrics related to certain acquired businesses

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations iac has a 300 million revolving credit facility that was amended and restated on october 7 2015 and now expires on october 7 2020 the iac credit facility the obligations under the iac credit facility are secured by the stock of certain iac domestic and foreign subsidiaries and unconditionally guaranteed by certain whollyowned iac domestic subsidiaries at december 31 2015 there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility on october 7 2015 match group entered into a credit agreement the match group credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear 500 million revolving credit facility the match group credit facility at december 31 2015 there were no outstanding borrowings under the match group credit facility 

on november 16 2015 match group completed a private exchange offer to eligible holders to exchange any and all of the 2012 senior notes for up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of match group senior notes issued by match group match exchange offer match group exchanged 4453 million of 2012 senior notes for 4452 million of match group senior notes pursuant to the match exchange offer promptly following the closing of the match exchange offer substantially all of the restrictive covenants of the 2012 senior notes were removed and match group and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of iac for purposes of the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and the iac credit facility following the designation neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guaranteed any debt of iac or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt 

on november 16 2015 match group amended and restated the match group credit agreement to provide for an 800 million sevenyear term loan principal payments of 10 million under the match group term loan are due quarterly through maturity at which point a final principal payment of 530 million will become due additionally the match group term loan may require additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision the amount of which is governed by the net secured leverage ratio the match group term loan bears interest at its option at either the base rate or libor plus 350 or 450  respectively with in the case of libor a floor of 100  interest payments are due no less than semiannually through the term of the loan the match group term loan and outstanding borrowings if any under the match group credit facility rank paripassu with each other and have priority over the match group senior notes 

the indenture governing the 2013 senior notes restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event we are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 in addition the terms of the iac credit facility require that we maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness the indenture governing the match group senior notes restricts match groups ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event they are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 50 to 10 additionally the terms of the match group credit facility require match group to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 500 to 100 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 250 to 100 as of december 31 2015 iac and match group were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

there are additional covenants under the match group credit facility and the match group term loan that limit match groups ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to among other things incur indebtedness pay dividends or make distributions while the match group term loan remains outstanding these same covenants under the match group credit agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the match group credit facility obligations under the match group credit facility and match group term loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain whollyowned match group domestic subsidiaries and are also secured by the stock of certain match group domestic and foreign subsidiaries in addition match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and has no obligation to provide the company with funds as a result we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries match group generated approximately 60 41 and 43 of the company operating cash flow in the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations the company expects that 2016 capital expenditures will be higher than 2015 by approximately 10 to 20 driven by leasehold improvements related to a new lease for match groups corporate headquarters and homeadvisors sales center expansion at december 31 2015 iac had 56 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time including without limitation market conditions share price and future outlook on february 2 2016 iac announced that it had suspended the quarterly cash dividend program future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of iacs board of directors 

the company believes its and match groups existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with their expected positive cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under their respective revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund their normal operating requirements including capital expenditures debt service and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future the companys and match groups liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our respective products and services the company’s indebtedness and match group’s indebtedness could limit our respective abilities to i obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements and ii use operating cash flow to make acquisitions capital expenditures invest in other areas such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and as a result the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda  is defined as operating income excluding 1 stockbased compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature and we believe that by excluding these items adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  stockbased compensation   expense  consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performancebased rsus these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method however performancebased rsus are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performancebased rsus the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required taxwithholding amount from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives 

  amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are noncash expenses related primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as content technology customer lists advertiser and supplier relationships are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business 

reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income loss by reportable segment and to net earnings attributable to iac shareholders for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations 

the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill 

 in connection with some business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics such as monthly active users the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probabilityweighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability and if the arrangement is longterm in nature applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period including the accretion of the discount if applicable are recognized in “general and administrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2015 related to the publishing and shoebuy reporting units these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the 2014 and 2013 annual assessments identified no material impairments the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is 22 billion and 3801 million respectively at december 31 2015 

the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value for the companys annual goodwill test at october 1 2015 a quantitative assessment of the match group publishing applications shoebuy and p ricerunner reporting units goodwill was performed a qualitative assessment of the homeadvisor connected ventur es and dailyburn reporting units goodwill was performed when the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value no further assessment of that reporting units goodwill is necessary otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a twostep process 

the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 12  to 22  in 2015  and 13  to 19  in 2014 determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based 

on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies from the comparable companies a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use monetization model margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors 

if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value a primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

at october 1 2015 the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment the fair value of the companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 with the exception of publishing and shoebuy to illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value had the estimated fair value of publishing and shoebuy been hypothetically lower by 10 and 20 as of october 1 2015 the carrying value of publishing would have exceeded its fair value by approximately 20 million and 60 million respectively and the carrying value of shoebuy would have exceeded its fair value by approximately 1 million and 5 million respectively 

while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value the companys policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 the company determines the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 11  to 16  in 2015 and 10  to 20  in 2014 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1  to 9  in both 2015 and 2014 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2013 the company wrote off certain capitalized software costs this charge is more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  depreciation the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 3635 million at december 31 2015 

income taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which 

may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes at december 31 2015 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 434 million including interest changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized as of december 31 2015 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 3468 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

stockbased compensation 

as disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2015 2014 and 2013 using a blackscholes option pricing model and for those with a market condition a lattice model for stock options including subsidiary denominated equity the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term the impact on stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2015 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 46 million 212 million and 103 million respectively the impact on stockbased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2015 assuming a zero dividend yield on the outstanding options would be an increase of 32 million the company also issues rsus and performancebased rsus for rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as stockbased compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 

marketable securities and longterm investments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt including current maturities 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist of money market funds shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established during the second quarter of 2015 the company recognized 03 million in losses that were deemed to be otherthantemporary related to various corporate debt securities that were expected to be sold by the company in part to fund its cash needs related to match groups acquisition of plentyoffish during 2014 and 2013 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2015 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by 03 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of 15 billion  was invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2015 the companys outstanding debt was 18 billion  including 400 million of current maturities of which 10 billion bears interest at fixed rates and 800 million bears interest at variable rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 409 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period the match group term loan currently bears interest at libor plus 450 with a libor floor of 100 libor at december 31 2015 for similar borrowings of three months was approximately 60 basis points if libor were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest payments on the match group term loan would increase by 60 basis points or 48 million in 2016 if libor decreased 60 basis points to zero annual interest payments on the match group term loan would remain the same such potential changes in interest payments are based on quarterly amortization and certain simplifying assumptions including a constant rate of variablerate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union for the year ended december 31 2015 international revenue accounted for 26 of consolidated revenue the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statements of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results the average euro versus the us dollar exchange rate was 16 lower in 2015 than 2014 the decrease had a significant impact to the revenue of match group for the year ended december 31 2015 match group revenue dating revenue and dating international revenue would have increased approximately 20 15 and 21 respectively as compared to the reported increases of 15 9 and 3 respectively had the foreign currency exchange rates been the same as 2014 

foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings in 2015 2014 and 2013 historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exposures our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

risk factors 

mr diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 30 2015 mr diller owned 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock representing 100 of iac’s outstanding class b common stock and approximately 425 of the total outstanding voting power of iac as of this date mr diller also owned 930734 vested options to purchase iac common stock and 75000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iac’s chairman and senior executive he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve‑month period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interest voting power and the contractual rights described above mr diller currently is in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future effective succession planning is also important to our future success if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses our ability to execute short and long term strategic financial and operating goals as well as our business financial condition and results of operations generally could be adversely affected 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google that expires on march 31 2016 pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our search  applications properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search  applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase changes to google’s paid listings network efficiency its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our search  applications properties its judgment about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services including the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could if not cured result in google’s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of iac’s rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition googles ability to limit our ability to market our products and services through its advertising services whether due to policy or competitive reasons or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

we continue to compete with traditional advertising media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting andor utilize mobile devices the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure an industrywide move to selfregulatory principles that require additional disclosure andor optin policies for advertising that incorporate user targeting or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search  applications search boxes toolbars and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either non‑exclusive and short‑term in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances in addition a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our b2b operations our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our search boxes toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of the businesses within the match group segment we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through email campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register with our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees these arrangements are generally not exclusive are short‑term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing andor new third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our homeadvisor business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network while these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long‑term agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled at any time in addition a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of home services professionals experiences turnover this turnover if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to homeadvisorcom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services for example in the case of aboutcom we rely on independent freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users if we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally andor the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a costeffective manner the experience of our users would be adversely affected which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in a costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new products services and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by google without advance notice could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related user experience as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall in the case of paid advertising generally the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising including google may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of search results the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition search engines continue to expand their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to build maintain andor enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of highlyrecognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries as well as a number of fledgling brands that we are in the process of building we believe that our success depends in part upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance our established brands as well as build awareness of and loyalty to our fledgling brands our brands and brandbuilding efforts could be negatively impacted by a 

number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches moreover the failure to market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers andor the inability to adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices could adversely impact our various brands and brandbuilding efforts and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

the internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes 

the development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the internet as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment require significant time and resources we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner also these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites applications services and proprietary technologies obsolete our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately andor in a cost effective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of certain of our applications third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new or updated technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services such as through the introduction of features andor processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use our services relative to those of our competitors for example third parties continue to introduce technologies including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use in addition there are technologies that interfere with the functionality of or settings changes made by our applications for example there are technologies that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users these technologies applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications which in turn adversely impacts our revenues technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services while many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers users of and usage volumes on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets continue to increase relative to those of personal computers while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices and intend to continue to do so in the future we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our nonmobile products and services in addition the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and in turn our ability to attract advertisers lastly as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread we will need to take steps to ensure that our products and services are attractive to users of mobile devices this shift could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including personal credit card data as well as private content such as videos and correspondence in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices regarding privacy generally and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data examples include the european union data protection directive as adopted and implemented by the various european union member states the eu directive various us state regulations concerning minimum data 

security standards industry selfregulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections and related compliance obligations regarding privacy and data security 

in addition if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy it could become subject to an investigation andor proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the us federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act andor brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law as well as a private lawsuit under various us federal and state laws similarly in the european union the online service provider could become subject to an investigation andor proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws as well as private causes of action under the eu directive in general personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world particularly in the european union the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

us and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security for example in may 2014 the white house released a review of big data practices which called for an update to us privacy laws based on the proposed consumer privacy bill of rights released by the white house in february 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law in addition in february 2013 the us federal trade commission issued a report seeking changes in internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures similarly new privacy laws and regulations at the state level as well as new laws and directives abroad particularly in the european union are being proposed and implemented for example legislation in the state of california that became effective on january 1 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals and the european union is in the process of adopting new guidelines for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments which will supersede the eu directive in addition existing privacy laws that were intended for brickandmortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses andor limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities such as targeted advertising which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches in the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with payment card industry pci data security standards moreover any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally which would decrease traffic to and in turn usage and transactions on the relevant website andor our various websites and which in turn could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies federal state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or pci standards as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to protect our systems infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks in addition we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties any disruption of our systems infrastructures and technologies or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyber attacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software distributed denial of service attacks or other malicious activities or any combination of these events is on the rise worldwide from time to time we may become the victim of these types of attacks 

while we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts we cannot assure you that these events will not occur in the future and if they do occur will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore we may become the victim of security breaches such as the misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of user customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations 

any cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services damage our reputation erode our brands andor be costly to remedy as well as result in a degradation of our products and services andor cause damage to our systems infrastructures technologies and data even if we do not experience such events the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations could have a similar effect moreover even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services 

in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events 

we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisitionrelated efforts 

even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance language and cultural differences and political andor economic instability including issues associated with establishing and maintaining effective management systems and infrastructures including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the staffing of foreign operations exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint 

venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 

for example through our various businesses we post and link to third party content including third party advertisements links and websites we also allow users to submit content such as comments photographs and videos we could be subject to liability for posting hosting or linking to third party content and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights some laws including the communications decency act or cda and the digital millennium copyright act or dmca limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content for example the dmca generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied however the scope and applicability of the dmca are subject to judicial interpretation and as such remain uncertain and the us congress may enact legislation affecting and potentially limiting the protections afforded by the dmca to online service providers moreover similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate as a result claims have been and could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting among other things negligence defamation invasion of privacy or right or publicity copyright infringement or trademark infringement 

also we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses as well as develop market andor distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our b2c and b2b operations which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications for example canada’s antispam legislation “casl” which became effective on july 1 2014 prohibits all commercial electronic messages including email text social media sound and image messages that are sent without proper consumer consent and effective january 15 2015 the casl restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications while several canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for casl violations effective july 1 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for casl violations 

in addition changing internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention one example of such changing practices is the increasing use of “native” advertising a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content the us federal trade commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within certain of our reporting segments search  applications the match group and ecommerce rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom 

aboutcom dictionarycom investopedia pricerunner askfm our various toolbar brands slimware matchcom okcupidcom ourtimecom meeticcom homeadvisorcom and shoebuycom and related domain names and logos through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to police unauthorized use of these trademarks and take action against infringement use these trademarks to identify their products and services and timely renew trademark and related domain name registrations as required they should continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search  applications segment also rely upon trade secrets including algorithms for the generation organization and presentation of search results to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patent‑pending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to search‑related products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033 and copyrighted material primarily software and content such as emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of toolbars and applications generally 

the match group segment also relies upon trade secrets and patented with expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2034 and patent‑pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services homeadvisor relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services moreover as traffic to our websites applications and online properties increases and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we fail to do so users customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or 

prolonged basis which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences in addition we could experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts which could have the same effect moreover even if we do not experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations may not make the changes to their systems infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions with users and customers furthermore fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

sources of revenue 

substantially all of the revenue from our search  applications segment is derived from online advertising this revenue is primarily attributable to our services agreement with google inc google which expires on march 31 2016 our services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines which could require modification to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  revenue earned from google was  14 billion   15 billion  and  14 billion  respectively 

the revenue earned from the match group segment is derived from dating and nondating services dating revenue is principally earned from subscription fees for our subscriptionbased online personals and related services with additional revenue generated from online advertising nondating revenue is primarily earned from fees received for inperson and online test preparation classes access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services the revenue earned by our media segment is derived from media production subscriptions and advertising homeadvisors revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and subscription sales to service professionals shoebuys revenue is derived principally from merchandise sales 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising 

a significant component of the companys revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments to partners who distribute our b2b customized browserbased applications integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on thirdparty distribution channels such as search engines and internet portals in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline thirdparty distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iacs businesses operate increases 

factors affecting results 

in 2014 we delivered 3  revenue growth however adjusted ebitda and operating income declined 9  and 11  respectively    revenue growth was primarily driven by the match group segment while the declines in adjusted ebitda and operating income were primarily driven by the search  applications and media segments revenue from the match group segment benefited from increased subscribers and the contributions from the princeton review which was acquired august 1 2014 and friendscout24 which was acquired august 31 2014 the results of our search  applications segment were negatively impacted by decreased revenue from our applications business which was principally due to lower queries from our b2b operations the search  applications adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the loss from slimware which was acquired april 1 2014 due to the writeoff of 110 million of deferred revenue in connection with its acquisition partially offset by the positive contribution of valueclick’s owned  operated oo website businesses which was acquired january 10 2014 within the media segment additional investment in vimeo increased its revenue and losses this revenue increase was more than offset by the lower revenue and increased losses at the daily beast following its sale of newsweek in august 2013 which generated a 63 million gain

income tax provision 

in 2014 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of 354 million  which represents an effective income tax rate of 13 the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35 due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 of 882 million and foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the writedowns of certain of the companys investments and nondeductible goodwill associated with the sale of urbanspoon in 2013 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of 1345 million  which represents an effective income tax rate of 32 the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35 due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates in 2012 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of 1192 million  which represents an effective income tax rate of 41 the effective rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35 due primarily to an increase in reserves for and interest on reserves for income tax contingencies a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset created by an otherthantemporary impairment charge and state taxes partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates

income tax provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 is a 48 million  expense and a 14 million  expense respectively net of related deferred taxes for interest on unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company has accrued 28 million  and 1330 million  respectively for the payment of interest at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company has accrued 29 million  and 51 million  respectively for penalties 

the company is routinely under audit by federal state local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax these audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions the internal revenue service is currently auditing the company’s federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2010 through 2012 various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years beginning with 2006 income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon the resolution of audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

the statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009 expired on july 1 2014 as a result previously unrecognized tax benefits including interest totaling 3748 million  were recognized in the third quarter of 2014 the income tax benefit to continuing operations and discontinued operations was 882 million  and 1757 million  respectively the remaining amount of 1109 million  impacted various balance sheet accounts primarily noncurrent deferred tax assets which were reduced by 1001 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company has unrecognized tax benefits including interest of 332 million and 4088 million  respectively if unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 are subsequently recognized 305 million net of related deferred tax assets and interest would reduce income tax provision for continuing operations the company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by 88 million within twelve months of the current reporting date primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitations 84 million of which would reduce the income tax provision for continuing operations 

earnings loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

earnings from discontinued operations net of tax in 2014 increased from 2013 principally due to the release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

adjusted ebitda is defined as operating income excluding 1 noncash compensation expense 2 depreciation and 3 acquisitionrelated items consisting of i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments and ii gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature and we believe that by excluding these items adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation  expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performancebased rsus these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury method however performancebased rsus are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performancebased rsus the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required taxwithholding amount from its current funds 

  depreciation is a noncash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straightline method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives 

  amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments  are noncash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as content technology customer lists advertiser and supplier relationships are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business 

reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income loss by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

business combinations 

the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill 

 in connection with some business combinations the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance andor operating metrics the company generally determines the fair value of contingent consideration using probabilityweighted analyses over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and to the extent the arrangement is longterm in nature applies a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement determining fair value is inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period are recognized in “general and administrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the 2014 2013 and 2012 annual assessments identified no material impairments the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is 18 billion and 4052 million respectively at december 31 2014 

the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value no further assessment of that reporting units goodwill is necessary otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows dcf and a market approach based on multiples of earnings determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13  to 19  in 2014  and 13  to 25  in 2013 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired 

in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value a primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

at october 1 2014 the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment the fair value of the companys reporting units exceed their carrying values the fair value of the search  applications reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15 if operating results vary significantly from anticipated results future potentially material impairments of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets could occur to illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value had the estimated fair value of search  applications been hypothetically lower by 20 as of october 1 2014 the carrying value of search  applications would have exceeded its fair value by approximately 100 million 

the company also has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined otherwise the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset must be determined and compared to its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 10  to 20  in 2014 and 10  to 18  in 2013 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 9 in both 2014 and 2013 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2013 the company wrote off certain capitalized software costs this charge is more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  depreciation the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 3892 million at december 31 2014 

income taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes at december 31 2014 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 332 million including interest changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized as of december 31 2014 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 3904 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

stockbased compensation 

as disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2014 2013 and 2012 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 15 10 and 06 respectively a dividend yield of 15 20 and 12 respectively volatility factors of 31 29 and 31 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 48 years 62 years and 44 years respectively for stock options including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2014 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 25 million 119 million and 51 million respectively the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2014 assuming a 1 increase in the dividend yield of the outstanding options would be a decrease of 11 million the company also issues rsus and performancebased rsus for rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 

marketable securities and longterm investments 

at december 31 2014 marketable securities consist of shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security longterm investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed the company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy 

marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter and the unrealized gains and losses net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be otherthantemporary additionally the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be otherthantemporary future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investments to decline 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary such impairment evaluations include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis the current business environment including competition going concern considerations such as financial condition the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investees ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan the need for changes to the investees existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes and comparable valuations during 2014 and 2013 the company recognized impairment charges of 666 million and 50 million respectively related to cost method investments and during 2012 the company recorded an impairment charge of 87 million related to one of its longterm marketable equity securities these charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  other expense income net

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist of money market funds and shorttomediumterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established during 2014 2013 and 2012 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2014 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by 21 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of 9904 million  is invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2014 the companys outstanding debt is 11 billion  all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 605 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments 

at december 31 2014 the company has two investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies these availableforsale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss net of tax included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market during 2014 and 2013 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its availableforsale marketable equity securities during 2012 the company recorded an 87 million otherthantemporary impairment charge related to one of its availableforsale marketable equity securities the otherthantemporary impairment charge is included in other expense income net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses the statements of operations of these international businesses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign activities result in reduced revenue and operating results similarly the companys revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the companys earnings in 2014 2013 and 2012 as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statements of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks the 

companys objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

competition 

we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to i attract users to our various search  applications properties and services generally ii develop market and distribute our applications iii attract third parties to distribute our applications and related technology and iv attract advertisers in the case of our search services generally our competitors include google yahoo bing and other destination search websites and search‑centric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers including internet access providers social media platforms online advertising networks traditional media companies and companies that provide online content when we market our search and content services our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

in the case of our websites business we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results answers and other content the functionality of our various websites the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of the services provided by our websites generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors we believe that we differentiate askcom from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate authoritative and direct answers to natural‑language questions in the form of algorithmic search results andor responses from other askcom users as well as indexed question and answer pairings from various websites and online services our ability to continue to differentiate askcom from its competitors in this manner depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative and trustworthy content to users as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative 

in the case of our applications business we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features content and services some of which may be owned by third parties with quality search services differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of our competitors primarily through providing customized 

toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars secure costeffective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a costeffective manner

homeadvisor services 

matching and other consumer services   when a consumer submits a request through the homeadvisor marketplace we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumers location consumers can then review home services professional profiles and select the professional that they believe best meets their specific needs in all cases if a match is made the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by homeadvisor

subscription services for home services professionals  in 2013 homeadvisor introduced three new subscription offerings for home services professionals each for a flat monthly fee the basic membership package includes membership in the homeadvisor network as well the inclusion of the home services professional’s contact information in homeadvisor’s online directory which is posted on wwwhomeadvisorcom  and affiliated websites consumers may search this online directory in addition to or in lieu of submitting a request through the homeadvisor marketplace with consumers ultimately 

selecting those home services professionals they wish to work with in lieu of homeadvisor providing matches and contacting such professionals directly the two additional membership packages include all of the basic membership package services plus matches through the homeadvisor marketplace and in the case of one package custom website and mobile development and hosting services as well 

since october 2013 homeadvisor has been marketing its subscription packages to existing home services professionals within its network and in the case of home services professionals who are new to homeadvisor  these professionals must sign up for one of the subscription offerings described above versus being able to join the network for free and only pay for matches which was the case prior to october 2013 as of december 31 2013 approximately 15000 of the more than 80000 home services professionals within the homeadvisor network had purchased a membership package 

marketing 

we market our services to consumers primarily through search engine marketing as well as through affiliate agreements with third parties pursuant to these agreements third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website on a costperacquisition basis or click through to our website on a costperclick basis we also market our services to consumers through the purchase of paid listings displayed in yellow page directories portals and contextual home improvement related sites and to a lesser extent through traditional offline advertising including television we market our subscription packages to home services professionals through our sales force as well as online through search engine marketing relationships with trade associations and affiliate marketing relationships

homeadvisors revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of our network of home services professionals for matches with consumers made by homeadvisor regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service as well as from subscription fees for our new home services professional subscription offerings fees for website hosting services and fees charged upon the enrollment and activation of new home services professionals in our network fees for matches vary based upon the service requested and where the service is provided 

competition   

we currently compete with home servicesrelated lead generation services as well as internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising including radio direct marketing campaigns yellow pages newspapers and other offline directories we also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors

risk factors 

mr diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 31 2014 mr diller owned 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock representing 100 of iac’s outstanding class b common stock and approximately 431 of the total outstanding voting power of iac as of this date mr diller also owned 855734 vested options to purchase iac common stock and 150000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iac’s chairman and senior executive he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve‑month period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interest voting power and the contractual rights described above mr diller currently is in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iac’s board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google that expires on march 31 2016 pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our search  applications properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of google’s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search  applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive changes to google’s paid listings network efficiency its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search  applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services including the manner in which google’s paid listings are displayed within search results and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with google’s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could if not cured result in google’s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of iac’s rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

we continue to compete with traditional advertising media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting andor utilize mobile devices the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure an industrywide move to self regulatory 

principles that required additional disclosure andor optin policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search  applications search boxes toolbars and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either non‑exclusive and short‑term in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances in addition a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our b2b applications our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our search boxes toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of the businesses within our match segment we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through email campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register with our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees these arrangements are generally not exclusive are short‑term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing andor new third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our homeadvisor business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network while these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long‑term agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled at any time in addition a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of home services professionals experiences turnover from time to time this turnover if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to homeadvisorcom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services for example in the case of aboutcom we rely on independent freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users if we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally andor the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a costeffective manner the experience of our users would be adversely affected which would result in a decrease in users and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new products services and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords which we purchase primarily through google online display advertising and traditional 

offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising which may be unilaterally updated by google could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related user experience as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall in the case of paid advertising generally the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of highlyrecognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries we believe that our success depends in part upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance these brands our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches moreover the failure to market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers andor the inability to adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices could adversely impact our various brands and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

the internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes 

the development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the internet as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment requires significant time and resources we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner also these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites applications services and proprietary technologies obsolete our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately andor in a cost effective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of certain of our applications third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new or updated technologies applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize these applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use these services such as through the introduction of features andor processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use these services relative to those of our 

competitors for example third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use in addition there are technologies and applications that interfere with the functionality of or settings changes made by our applications for example there are technologies and applications that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users these technologies applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications which in turn adversely impacts our revenues technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of our advertising products our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success also depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services while most of our users currently access our products and services through personal computers users of and usage volumes on mobile devices including tablets continue to increase relative to those of personal computers while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and intend to continue to do so in the future we have limited experience with mobile applications both in terms of development and monetization moreover mobile versions of our products and services that we develop may not be compelling to users andadvertisers even if we are able to develop mobile applications that resonate with users and advertisers the success of these applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and in turn our ability to attract advertisers lastly as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread the usage of certain of our products and services may not translate to mobile devices which shift could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including credit card data in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations as well as evolving industry standards and practices regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data for example various state regulations concerning minimum data security standards industry selfregulating principles that become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections regarding privacy and data security and related compliance obligations 

in addition if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy it could become subject to an investigation and proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the us federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act andor brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law as well as a private lawsuit under various us federal and state laws in general personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

us legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security in february 2012 the white house released a proposed consumer privacy bill of rights which is intended to serve as a framework for new privacy legislation in march 2012 the us federal trade commission released a staff report making recommendations for businesses and policy makers in the area of consumer privacy similarly new privacy laws and regulations at the state level as well as new laws and directives abroad particularly in europe are being proposed and implemented for example new legislation in the state of california that became effective on january 1 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser do not track signals in addition existing privacy laws that were intended for brickandmortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses andor limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities such as targeted advertising which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches in the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with payment card industry pci data security standards moreover any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally which would decrease traffic to and in turn usage and transactions on the relevant website andor our various websites and which in turn could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies federal state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or pci standards andor the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisitionrelated efforts 

even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the staffing of foreign operations exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 

for example through our various businesses we post and link to third party content including third party advertisements links and websites we also allow users to submit content such as comments photographs and videos we could be subject to liability for posting hosting or linking to third party content and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights some laws including the communications decency act or cda and the digital millennium copyright act or dmca limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content for example the dmca generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied however the scope and applicability of the dmca are subject to judicial interpretation and as such remain uncertain and the us congress may enact legislation affecting and potentially limiting the protections afforded by the dmca to online service providers moreover similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate as a result claims have been and could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting among other things negligence defamation invasion of privacy or right or publicity copyright infringement or trademark infringement 

in addition changing internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention one example of such changing practices is the advent of socalled “native” advertising a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content the us federal trade commission recently indicated that it will be monitoring the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within our principal reporting segments search  applications match and local rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom aboutcom dictionarycom our various toolbar brands matchcom okcupidcom ourtimecom meeticcom and homeadvisorcom and related domain names and logos through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew trademark registrations as required they will continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search  applications segment also rely upon trade secrets including algorithms for the generation organization and presentation of search results to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patent‑pending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to search‑related products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033 and copyrighted material primarily emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of toolbars generally 

our match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent‑pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services homeadvisor relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our websites applications 

and online properties increases and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we fail to do so users customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or prolonged basis which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences in addition we could experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts which could have the same effect moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions with users and customers furthermore data security breaches as a result of actions taken by hackers or otherwise fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs applications and activity that make changes to users computers and interfere with the overall experience of our products and services such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them 

in addition downloadable applications through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computers or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

  sources of revenue 

substantially all of the revenue from our search  applications segment is derived from online advertising this revenue is primarily attributable to our services agreement with google inc google the revenue earned from our match segment is derived primarily from subscription fees for its subscriptionbased online personals services match also derives revenue from online advertising our local segment consists of homeadvisor and felix homeadvisors revenue is derived from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and from subscription sales to service professionals as well as from onetime fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new home services professionals in its network felixs revenue is derived from online advertising the revenue earned by our media segment is derived from advertising media production and subscription fees the revenue earned by our other segment is derived principally from merchandise sales and subscription fees 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising spend 

a significant component of the companys revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google which expires on march 31 2016 for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  revenue earned from google was  15 billion   14 billion  and  9704 million  respectively this revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the search  applications segment 

we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments to partners who distribute our b2b customized browserbased applications integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels such as internet portals and search engines in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iacs businesses operate increases 

factors affecting results

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization  is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization and impairment of intangibles 3 goodwill impairment 4 acquisitionrelated contingent consideration fair value adjustments and 5 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation and acquisitionrelated accounting 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with the securities and exchange commission rules gaap results include onetime items for the periods presented in this report there are no adjustments for onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation  expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performancebased rsus these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for stock options and rsus are included on a treasury method basis and for performancebased rsus are included on a treasury method basis once the performance conditions are met upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performancebased rsus the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required taxwithholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of intangibles including impairment of intangibles if applicable and goodwill impairment if applicable  are noncash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as content technology customer lists advertiser and supplier relationships are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration fair value adjustments  are accounting adjustments to record contingent consideration liabilities at fair value these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered nonoperational in nature and therefore are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business 

reconciliation of operating income before amortization 

for a reconciliation of operating income before amortization to operating income loss by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified no impairment charges in 2013 2012 or 2011 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is  17 billion  and 3763 million respectively at december 31 2013 

in 2012 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value no further assessment of that reporting units goodwill is necessary otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 25 in both 2013 and 2012 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

at october 1 2013 the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment the fair value of six of the companys eight  reporting units significantly exceed their carrying values and the fair value of tutor and felix both of which were acquired in 2012 approximates their carrying value any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

in 2012 the company adopted asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined otherwise the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset must be determined and 

compared to its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 10 to 18 in both 2013 and 2012 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 9 in both 2013 and 2012

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2013 and 2011 the company wrote off certain capitalized software costs these charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  depreciation the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 3630 million at december 31 2013 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2013 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 2866 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes at december 31 2013 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 4088 million including interest changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

stockbased compensation 

as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2013 2012 and 2011 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 10 06 and 23 respectively a dividend yield of 20 12 and zero respectively volatility factors of 29 31 and 30 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 62 years 44 years and 61 years respectively for stock options including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 20 million 92   million and 39 million respectively the company also issues rsus and performancebased rsus for rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 

marketable securities and longterm investments 

marketable securities consist of equity securities and a shorttomediumterm debt security issued by an investment grade corporate issuer longterm investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed the company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy 

marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter and the unrealized gains and losses net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be otherthantemporary additionally the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be otherthantemporary future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investments to decline 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary such impairment evaluations include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis the current business environment including competition going concern considerations such as financial condition the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee companys ability to obtain additional financing to achieve business plan the need for changes to the investee companys existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes and comparable valuations during 2013 the company recognized an impairment charge of 50 million related to a cost method investment and during 2012 the company recorded an impairment charge of 87 million related to one of its longterm marketable equity securities these charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  other income expense net 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist of money market funds and a shorttomediumterm debt security issued by an investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established during 2013 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2013 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than 01 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of  11 billion  is invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2013 the companys outstanding debt is 11 billion  all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 675 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments 

at december 31 2013 the company has three investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies these availableforsale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss net of tax included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market during 2013 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its availableforsale marketable equity securities during 2012 the company recorded an 87 million otherthantemporary impairment charge related to one of its availableforsale marketable equity securities the otherthantemporary impairment charge is included in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses the statements of operations of the companys international businesses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue and operating results similarly the companys revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the companys earnings in 2013 2012 and 2011 as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statements of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks the 

companys objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

revenue is also derived from the sale of display content‑based and other advertising pursuant to a variety of advertising models and the syndication of search results generated by askbranded destination search websites 

competition 

we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to i attract users to our various search  applications properties and services generally ii develop market and distribute our b2c and b2b applications iii attract third parties to distribute our applications and related technology and iv attract advertisers in the case of our search services generally our competitors include google yahoo bing and other destination search websites and search‑centric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers including internet access providers social media platforms online advertising networks traditional media companies and companies that provide online content when we market our search and content services our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

in the case of our websites we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results answers and other content the functionality of our various websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of the services provided by our websites generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors we believe that we differentiate askcom from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate authoritative and direct answers to natural‑language questions in the form of algorithmic search results andor responses from other askcom users our ability to continue to differentiate askcom from its competitors in this manner depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative and trustworthy content to users as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative 

in the case of our applications we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features content and services some of which may be owned by third parties with quality search services differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of our competitors primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars secure costeffective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a costeffective manner

risk factors 

mr diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of february 1 2013 mr diller owned 5789499 shares of iac class b common stock representing 100 of iacs outstanding class b common stock and approximately 425 of the total outstanding voting power of iac as of this date mr diller also owned 780734 vested options to purchase iac common stock and 225000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iacs chairman and senior executive he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iacs ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve‑month period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr dillers ownership interest voting power and the contractual rights described above mr diller currently is in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iacs board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google that expires on march 31 2016 pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our search  applications properties in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other search‑related services 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements the efficiency of googles system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search  applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive changes to googles paid listings network efficiency its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search  applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our services agreement with google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services including the manner in which googles paid listings are displayed within search results and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit andor render obsolete certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with googles guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our toolbars could if not cured result in googles suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by google 

the termination of the services agreement by google the curtailment of iacs rights under the agreement whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate provider were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media accordingly we continue to compete with traditional advertising media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting andor utilize mobile devices the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which web browsers software programs andor other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market 

for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure andor optin policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute search  applications search boxes toolbars and other applications to users through third parties most of these agreements are either non‑exclusive and short‑term in nature or in the case of long‑term or exclusive agreements are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances in addition a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our b2b applications our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our search boxes toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic queries and advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of the businesses within our match segment we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through email campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register with our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees these arrangements are generally not exclusive are short‑term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing andor new third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our homeadvisor business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network while these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long‑term agreements with them in addition a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of home services professionals experiences turnover from time to time this turnover if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to homeadvisorcom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new products services and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs in the case of paid advertising generally the policies 

of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enhance our various brands 

through our various businesses we own and operate a number of highlyrecognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries we believe that our success depends in part upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance these brands our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including product and service quality concerns consumer complaints actions brought by consumers governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches moreover the failure to market our products and services successfully or in a costeffective manner the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers andor the inability to adapt quickly enough andor in a cost effective manner to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies applications and devices could adversely impact our various brands and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations 

the internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes 

the development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the internet as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment requires significant time and resources we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner also these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites applications services and proprietary technologies obsolete our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately andor in a cost effective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of certain of our applications third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new or updated technologies applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize these applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use these services such as through the introduction of features andor processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use these services relative to those of our competitors for example third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use in addition there are technologies and applications that interfere with the functionality of or settings changes made by our applications for example there are technologies and applications that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously 

selected by our users these technologies applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications which in turn adversely impacts our revenues technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of our advertising products our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success also depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services while most of our users currently access our products and services through personal computers users of and usage volumes on mobile devices including tablets continue to increase relative to those of personal computers while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and intend to continue to do so in the future we have limited experience with mobile applications both in terms of development and monetization moreover mobile versions of our products and services that we develop may not be compelling to users andadvertisers even if we are able to develop mobile applications that resonate with users and advertisers the success of these applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and in turn our ability to attract advertisers lastly as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread the usage of certain of our products and services may not translate to mobile devices which shift could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data including credit card data in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online products and services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses these policies are in turn subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data for example if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy it could become subject to an investigation and proceeding brought by the us federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act as well as a private lawsuit under various us federal and state laws in general personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

us legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security in february 2012 the white house released a proposed consumer privacy bill of rights which is intended to serve as a framework for new privacy legislation in march 2012 the us federal trade commission released a staff report making recommendations for businesses and policy makers in the area of consumer privacy similarly new privacy laws and directives abroad particularly in europe are being proposed and implemented in addition existing privacy laws that were intended for brickandmortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses andor limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities such as targeted advertising which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches in the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with payment card industry pci data security standards the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies federal state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or pci standards andor the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we 

are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities as well as maximize our existing assets as a result our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

 we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in various international markets some in which we have limited experience as a result we face additional risks in connection with our international operations also we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into our existing international markets 

we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

operating abroad particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the staffing of foreign operations exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use value‑added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet 

and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 

for example through our various businesses we post and link to third party content including third party advertisements links and websites as well as content submitted by users such as comments photographs and videos we could be subject to liability for posting or linking to third party content and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights some laws including the communications decency act or cda and the digital millennium copyright act or dmca limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content for example the dmca generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on use of third party content so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied however the scope and applicability of the dmca are subject to judicial interpretation and as such remain uncertain and the us congress may enact legislation limiting the protections afforded by the dmca to online service providers moreover similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate as a result claims could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting among other things defamation invasion of privacy or right or publicity copyright infringement or trademark infringement 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within our principal reporting segments search  applications match and local rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom and dictionarycom our various toolbar brands matchcom okcupidcom meeticcom and homeadvisorcom and related domain names and logos through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew trademark registrations as required they will continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search  applications segment also rely upon trade secrets including algorithms for the generation organization and presentation of search results to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patent‑pending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to search‑related products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027 and copyrighted material primarily emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of toolbars generally 

our match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent‑pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services homeadvisor also relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate 

protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these measures our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business 

to succeed our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our websites applications and online properties increases and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we do not do so users customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or prolonged basis which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences in addition we could experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts which could have the same effect moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide our products and services andor process certain transactions with users and customers furthermore data security breaches as a result of actions taken by hackers or otherwise fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruptions delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs applications and activity that make changes to users computers and interfere with the overall experience of our products and services such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them 

in addition downloadable applications through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computers or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

in 2012 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of  1192 million  which represents an effective income tax rate of 41 the 2012 effective rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35 due primarily to an increase in reserves for and interest on reserves for income tax contingencies a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset created by the otherthantemporary impairment charge related to a longterm marketable equity security and state taxes partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates in 2011 the company recorded an income tax benefit for continuing operations of  40 million  despite pretax income of a  1715 million  the income tax benefit is due principally to the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability described in the next sentence the effective settlement of audits expirations of statutes of limitations and foreign income taxed at lower rates in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in meetic in 2011 the company concluded that it intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of match’s international operations related to meetic including the 2009 gain on sale of match europe outside of the united states which resulted in a deferred tax liability reversal of 437 million in 2010 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of  321 million  which represents an effective tax rate of 141 the 2010 tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to nondeductible impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets interest on reserves for income tax contingencies a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset created by the impairment charge for an equity method investment and state taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower rates 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 3793 million and 3516 million respectively unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 increased 277 million from december 31 2011 due principally to a net increase in deductible timing differences and additions for tax positions related to prior years the company recognizes interest and if applicable penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision included in income tax 

provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012 is a 52 million expense and a 28 million benefit respectively net of related deferred taxes for interest on unrecognized tax benefits included in income tax provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2011 is a 14 million expense and a 67 million expense respectively net of related deferred taxes respectively for interest on unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company has accrued 1175 million and 1112 million respectively for the payment of interest at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company has accrued 50 million and 25 million respectively for penalties 

the company is routinely under audit by federal state local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax these audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs has substantially completed its audit of the companys tax returns for the years ended december 31 2001 through 2009 the settlement of these tax years has not yet been submitted to the joint committee of taxation for approval the statute of limitations for the years 2001 through 2009 has been extended to december 31 2013 and we expect it to be extended further various state and local jurisdictions are currently under examination the most significant of which are california new york and new york city for various tax years beginning with 2005 income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known the company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by 1222 million  within twelve months of the current reporting date of which approximately 134 million  could decrease income tax provision primarily due to settlements expirations of statutes of limitations and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that will primarily result in a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets an estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits while potentially significant cannot be made 

discontinued operations 

in 2010 the company recognized an aftertax gain of 1408 million on the taxfree exchange of evite giftscom and iac advertising solutions 

the 2012 loss is primarily due to an increase in reserves for income tax contingencies the 2011 loss is primarily due to interest on reserves for income tax contingencies partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains related to the liquidation of certain inactive subsidiaries the 2010 loss is primarily due to losses of instantaction which includes a pretax impairment charge related to goodwill of 316 million

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization  is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization and impairment of intangibles 3 goodwill impairment and 4 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation and acquisitionrelated accounting 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with the securities and exchange commission rules gaap results include onetime items for the periods presented in this report there are no onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation  expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units rsus and performancebased rsus these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for stock options and rsus are included on a treasury method basis and for performancebased rsus are included on a treasury method basis once the performance conditions are met upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performancebased rsus the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of intangibles including impairment of intangibles if applicable and goodwill impairment if applicable  are noncash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as content technology advertiser and supplier relationships and customer lists are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

reconciliation of operating income before amortization 

for a reconciliation of operating income before amortization to operating income loss by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these estimates judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the shoebuy and search  applications reporting units these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is  16 billion  and 3790 million respectively at december 31 2012 

in 2012 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value no further assessment of that reporting units goodwill is necessary if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value then goodwill must be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 25 in 2012 and 13 to 20 in 2011 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the fair value of each of the companys seven reporting units excluding tutor which was acquired in december 2012 exceed their carrying values by more than 20 at october 1 2012 the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

in 2012 the company adopted asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined if it is more likely than not that 

the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value then the fair value of asset must be determined and compared to its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 10 to 18 in 2012 and 13 to 20 in 2011 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 9 in both 2012 and 2011 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2011 the company wroteoff certain capitalized software costs these charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the carrying value of property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets is 3745 million at december 31 2012 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2012 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 3030 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes at december 31 2012 the company has unrecognized tax benefits of 4968 million including interest changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid if any upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known 

stockbased compensation 

as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2012 2011 and 2010 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 06 23 and 24 respectively a dividend yield of 12 zero and zero respectively volatility factors of 31 30 and 30 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 44 years 61 years and 56 years respectively for stock options including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2012 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 22 million 104 million and 50 million respectively the company also issues rsus and performancebased rsus for rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performancebased rsus issued the value of the instrument is measured at 

the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 

marketable securities 

the company invests in certain marketable securities which primarily consist of shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairments of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis which may be maturity if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investment in marketable securities to decline during 2012 the company recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 87 million related to one of its longterm marketable equity securities this charge is more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 during 2011 the company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be otherthantemporarily impaired 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys cash equivalents marketable debt securities and longterm debt including the current portion thereof 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist primarily of money market instruments and shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established during 2012 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities at december 31 2012 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than 01 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of  7500 million  is invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

at december 31 2012 the companys outstanding debt is 5958 million all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 499 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments 

at december 31 2012 the company has three investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies these availableforsale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss net of tax included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market during 2012 the company recorded an 87 million otherthantemporary impairment charge related to one of its availableforsale marketable equity securities the otherthantemporary impairment charge is included in other expense income net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses the statements of operations of the companys international businesses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue and operating results similarly the companys revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the companys earnings in 2012 2011 and 2010 as foreign currency exchange rates change translation of the statements of operations of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks the 

companys objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

competition 

we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to i attract users to our various search properties and search services generally ii develop market and distribute toolbars and related applications iii attract third parties to distribute our toolbars and search boxes and iv attract advertisers our competitors include google yahoo bing and other destination search websites and searchcentric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers including internet access providers social networks online advertising networks traditional media companies and companies that provide online content 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

in the case of our mindspark business we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars that resonate with consumers which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features content and services some of which may be owned by third parties with quality search services differentiate our toolbars from those of our competitors primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars market and distribute toolbars directly to consumers in a costeffective manner and secure costeffective toolbar distribution arrangements with third parties and through other means as well as attract advertisers 

in the case of our destination search websites we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results and other content the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors in the case of the relevance and authority of our search results our current goal is to differentiate 

askcom from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate authoritative and direct answers to naturallanguage questions in the form of algorithmic search results andor responses from other askcom users the success of this initiative depends primarily upon our ability to develop a community of askcom users with the expertise necessary to provide accurate and authoritative answers to questions as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative in the case of the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering users unique searchrelated features such as ask eraser  which when activated by users who enter search queries on askcom  deletes from our servers search queries and related cookie and other information used to track internet activity

competition 

the personals business is very competitive and highly fragmented in the united states and abroad and barriers to entry are minimal we compete primarily with online and offline broadbased personals dating and matchmaking services both free and paid social networking websites the personals sections of newspapers and magazines other conventional media companies that provide personals services and traditional venues where singles meet both online and offline we also compete with numerous online and offline personals dating and matchmaking services that cater to specific demographic groups 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors 

• the size and diversity of our registered member and subscriber bases relative to those of our competitors • the functionality of our websites and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors • how quickly we can enhance our existing technology and services andor develop new features and services in response to • new emerging and rapidly changing technologies • the introduction of product and service offerings by our competitors • evolving industry standards and • changes in consumer requirements and trends in the single community relative to our competitors and • our ability to engage in costeffective marketing efforts including by way of maintaining relationships with third parties with which we have entered into alliances and the recognition and strength of our various brands relative to those of our competitors servicemagic

marketing 

we market our services to consumers primarily through search engine marketing as well as through affiliate agreements with third parties pursuant to these agreements third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and the services of our member service professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website on a costperacquisition basis or click through to our website on a costperclick basis we also market our services to consumers through the purchase of paid listings displayed in yellow page directories portals and contextual home improvement related sites and to a lesser extent through traditional offline advertising we market our services to service professionals through our sales force which obtains information concerning service professionals through a variety of sources we also promote online enrollment in our network through search engine marketing relationships with trade associations and affiliate marketing relationships 

revenues 

our revenues are generated from fees paid by members of our network of service professionals for consumer leads regardless of whether the service professional that received the lead ultimately 

provides the requested service as well as from onetime fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in our network lead fees vary based upon the service requested with fees for leads generated through our exact match service being greater than those for leads generated through our market match service our revenues are also generated to a lesser extent from fees paid by service professionals for website development and hosting services provided by markethardware 

competition 

we currently compete with other servicerelated lead generation services primarily home servicerelated services as well as with internet directories and local advertising including radio direct marketing campaigns yellow pages newspapers and other offline directories we also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors 

• the size quality as determined in part by reference to our prescreening efforts and customer ratings and reviews diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the quality of services provided by these professionals • our continued ability to deliver consumer leads that convert into revenues for our network of service professionals in a costeffective manner and • the functionality of our websites and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers and service professionals as well as our ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals media  other businesses

risk factors 

mr diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board or directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 31 2011 mr diller owned approximately 43 million shares of iac class b common stock representing 100 of iacs outstanding class b common stock and approximately 338 of the total outstanding voting power of iac mr diller may acquire additional shares of iac class b common stock through the exercise of an exchange right pursuant to which he may exchange with iac on a oneforone basis from time to time until september 1 2011 up to 15 million shares of iac common stock he acquires in the open market or otherwise for shares of iac class b common stock currently held in treasury by iac 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement among iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iacs chairman and senior executive he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iacs ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelvemonth period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr dillers ownership interest voting power and the contractual rights described above mr diller currently is in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iacs board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our search services that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through google in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other searchrelated services 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements and the efficiency of googles system 

in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search services and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive changes to googles paid listings network efficiency or its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search services could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our paid listing supply agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its services and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings specifically the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display google paid listings within search results subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with googles guidelines by us or third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings could if not cured result in googles suspension of some or all services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google 

the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media accordingly we continue to compete with traditional media including television radio and print in addition to a 

multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure andor optin policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into users and customers 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes to users through third parties these agreements are generally not exclusive are short term in nature and are terminable by either party upon notice our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic queries and advertising revenues which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of the businesses within our match segment we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register on our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees these arrangements are generally not exclusive are short term in nature and are terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our servicemagic business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of service professionals who are members of our service provider network while these professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long term contracts with them in addition a significant number of our service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of service professionals may experience turnover from time to time which if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to servicemagiccom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new products services and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs in the case of paid advertising generally the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards coupled with frequent and related new product and service introductions and enhancements the development of new product and service introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes or appropriately time the introduction of new products services and enhancements to the market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the continued widespread adoption of new internet and telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example user and usage volumes on mobile devices continue to increase relative to those of personal computers the lower resolution functionality display limitations and memory associated with mobile devices could make the use of our various services through these devices difficult while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our services we have limited experience with these applications and they may not be compelling to users furthermore existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to cover the provision of our services on mobile devices which the counterparties may be unwilling to do 

furthermore in the case of certain of our search services third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new technologies applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of our users to access or utilize some of our services generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services such as through the introduction and features andor processes that make the access and use of our services cumbersome relative to those of our competitors for example third parties have introduced technologies and applications that prevent users from downloading toolbars generally andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will download our toolbars and that previously downloaded toolbars will remain in active use such as features that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and other settings previously selected by users third parties have also introduced technologies and applications that are either not compatible with or otherwise interfere with the search assistant function embedded within our toolbars pursuant to which our toolbars generate search results for users that receive dns 404 and other errors in response to search queries entered into search boxes embedded within our toolbars or the address bar of their web browsers these technologies and applications adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our toolbars which in turn adversely impacts our revenues our failure to successfully modify our toolbars in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income 

tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

• successfully integrate the operations as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems • retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and • successfully manage acquisitionrelated strain on the management operations and financial resources of iac andor acquired businesses we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in certain international markets in which we have limited experience and as a result face additional risks we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into existing international markets 

we currently operate in a limited number of jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the us moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth 

operating abroad where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures the staffing of foreign operations exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms given that we could encounter significant barriers to entry in connection with expansion efforts outside of these arrangements 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use valueadded and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the type of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the 

internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain for example laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroad claims could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign law for defamation libel slander invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity copyright and trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our products and services or content generated by us and our users 

in addition the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act those of our businesses that mention or otherwise incorporate copyrighted material into the content they produce also rely on fair use principles which allow limited use of copyrighted materials without having to obtain the consent of the copyright holder provided we satisfy certain legal criteria also the childrens online privacy protection act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act we face similar risks and costs as our products services and content are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to consumers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities and while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

there are currently pending several bills in the us congress which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed additionally the us federal trade commission released a staff report in december 2010 in which it proposed a new framework for addressing commercial use of consumer data we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in the practices andor privacy policies of our various businesses which 

could be costly to implement or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that otherwise negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within our principal reporting segments our search match and servicemagic reporting segments rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom  our various toolbar brands matchcom and servicemagiccom and related domain names and logos through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew related trademarks upon their expiration they will continue to have related trademark protections indefinitely under current trademark laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search segment also rely heavily upon trade secrets primarily search algorithms through which organic search results are generated to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to searchrelated products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027 and copyrighted material primarily emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of toolbars generally 

our match segment also relies upon patentpending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services our servicemagic segment also relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of local service professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these precautions our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brand names and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure and those of third parties system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our businesses 

to succeed our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our various websites increases and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we do not do so or if we experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts users customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our services on an intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of their experiences could be adversely affected moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems infrastructure and technology needed in order to access our services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide services andor process certain transactions with customers furthermore data security breaches as a result of the actions of hackers or otherwise fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs applications and activity that make changes to users computers and interfere with the overall experience of our services such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without 

disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them in addition downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computer or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations by segment of operating income before amortization to operating income loss 

sources of revenue 

substantially all of the revenue from our search segment is derived from online advertising with the majority of this revenue attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with google inc google the revenue earned from our match segment is derived from subscription fees for its subscriptionbased online personals services and online advertising servicemagics revenue is derived from fees paid by members of its network of service professionals for consumer leads regardless of whether the service professional that receives the lead ultimately provides the requested service as well as from onetime fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in its network the revenue earned by the media  other segment includes merchandise sales online advertising and content production 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising spend 

our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit while we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future 

a significant component of the companys revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google which expires on december 31 2012 the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 revenue earned from google was 7279 million 5619 million and 6107 million respectively the majority of this revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the search segment 

we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and membership programs allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our toolbars integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels such as internet portals and search engines in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which iacs businesses operate increases

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization of noncash marketing 3 amortization and impairment of intangibles 4 goodwill impairment 5 pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions and 6 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation noncash marketing and acquisitionrelated accounting 

pro forma results 

we will only present operating income before amortization on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature for the periods presented in this report there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with the securities and exchange commission rules for the periods presented in this report there are no onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units and restricted stock these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for stock options and restricted stock units are included on a treasury method basis upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of noncash marketing consists of noncash advertising credits secured from universal television as part of the transaction pursuant to which vue was created and the subsequent transaction by which iac sold its partnership interests in vue collectively referred to as nbc universal advertising the nbc universal advertising was available for television advertising on 

various nbc universal network and cable channels without any cash cost there are no nbc universal advertising credits available as all credits were used prior to december 31 2009 

the nbc universal advertising is excluded from operating income before amortization because it is noncash and generally is incremental to the advertising the company otherwise secures as a result of its ordinary costbenefit marketing planning process accordingly the companys aggregate level of advertising and the increased concentration of that advertising on nbc universal network and cable channels does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits as a result management believes that treating the nbc universal advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true costbenefit relationship nor does it best reflect the companys longterm level of advertising expenditures nonetheless while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine and especially so with respect to the nbc universal advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration it is likely that the company does derive benefits from it though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above operating income before amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense 

  amortization of intangibles including impairment of intangibles if applicable and goodwill impairment if applicable are noncash expenses relating to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as customer lists technology and supplier agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are tested annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the shoebuy and iac search  media reporting units and in 2009 related to the iac search  media reporting unit these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is 9895 million and 2370 million respectively at december 31 2010 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 20 in both 2010 and 2009 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset 

exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 20 in both 2010 and 2009 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 10 in both 2010 and 2009 

the company has six reporting units with goodwill of these iac search  media and shoebuy have fair values closest to their carrying values the amount of goodwill of each of these reporting units is 5340 million and 217 million respectively at december 31 2010 to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges related to potential future changes in estimated fair values had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10 as of october 1 2010 their estimated fair values would exceed their carrying values had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20 as of october 1 2010 the carrying values of iac search  media and shoebuy would have exceeded their fair values by approximately 9 million and 3 million respectively if operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results future and in the case of iac search  media potentially material impairments of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets could occur 

any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2010 the company did not record any impairment charges related to definitelived intangible assets during 2009 the company recorded an impairment charge related to the definitelived intangible assets of iac search  media the definitelived intangible asset impairment charge primarily related to certain technology and advertiser relationships the carrying values of which were no longer considered recoverable based upon an assessment of future cash flows related to these assets accordingly these assets were written down to fair value in 2009 the value of longlived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment is 2760 million at december 31 2010 

marketable securities 

the company invests in certain marketable securities which consist primarily of shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us government agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of a security sold or the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis which may be maturity if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investment in marketable securities to decline during 2010 the company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be otherthantemporarily impaired during 2009 the company sold its 55 million shares of aro stock resulting in aggregate losses of 123 million prior to the sale of its last 11 million shares of aro stock the company concluded that the decline in the stock price of these remaining shares was otherthantemporary due in part to aros insolvency filing on june 9 2009 and recorded impairment charges totaling 46 million 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it is assessed that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors including the length of time accounts receivable are past due the companys previous loss history the specific customers ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the customers industry the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible the company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments the amount of these reserves are based in part on historical experience as of december 31 2010 the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is 88 million 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2010 the balance of deferred tax liabilities net is 2347 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the irs as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon 

ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

stock based compensation 

as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2010 2009 and 2008 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 24 21 and 26 respectively a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 30 59 and 47 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac for 2010 and peer companies operating in the same industry sector as iac for 2009 and 2008 and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 56 years 49 years and 44 years respectively the historical stock price volatilities in 2009 and 2008 of peer companies was used due to the lack of sufficient historical iac stock price volatilities subsequent to the spinoff for stock options including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2010 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 15 million 77 million and 50 million respectively the company also issues restricted stock units and performance stock units for restricted stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performance stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and longterm debt 

investment portfolio 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist primarily of money market instruments and shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us governmental agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities as of december 31 2010 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the debt investment securities by 32 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately 7421 million is invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

longterm debt 

at december 31 2010 the companys outstanding debt approximated 958 million all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 105 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

at december 31 2010 the company has two investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies one of these investments is the companys investment in meetic which is accounted for using the equity method the other investment is an availableforsale marketable equity security the investment in meetic is included in longterm investments and the availableforsale marketable equity security is included in marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the availableforsale marketable equity security is reported at fair value based on its quoted market price with any unrealized gain or loss net of tax included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market among other factors during 2010 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its availableforsale marketable equity security it is not customary for the company to make significant investments in equity securities as part of its marketable securities investment strategy 

iac holds approximately 61 million shares of common stock a 27 stake in meetic an online dating company based in france meetics shares are listed on the euronext stock exchange epa meet as a result iac is exposed to changes in meetics stock price the investment in meetic is accounted for using the equity method and the company records its share of the results of meetic and related amortization of intangibles on a onequarter lag within equity in losses income of unconsolidated affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations the carrying value of the meetic investment is 1300 million at december 31 2010 which is lower than the carrying value of 1565 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a dividend of 114 million the fair value of the meetic investment based on its quoted market price is 1300 million at december 31 2010 because our investment in meetic is accounted for using the equity method it is not reported at fair value in the event the fair value of meetic were to decline below its carrying value this decline would be only one factor in an assessment for otherthantemporary impairment 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling and euro however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 17 15 and 20 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the statements of operations of the companys international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues and operating income similarly the companys revenue and operating income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings in 2010 2009 and 2008 as currency exchange rates change translation of the income statements of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency translation risks the companys objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

competition 

we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to i attract users to our various search properties and search services generally ii develop market and distribute toolbars and related applications iii attract third parties to distribute our toolbars and search boxes and iv attract advertisers our competitors include google yahoo bing and other destination search websites and searchcentric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers including internet access providers social networks online advertising networks traditional media companies and companies that provide online content 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

in the case of our mindspark business we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars that resonate with consumers which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features content and services some of which may be owned by third parties with quality search services differentiate our toolbars from those of our competitors primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars market and distribute toolbars directly to consumers in a costeffective manner and secure costeffective toolbar distribution arrangements with third parties and through other means as well as attract advertisers 

in the case of our destination search websites we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results and other content the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors in the case of the relevance and authority of our search results our current goal is to differentiate 

askcom from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate authoritative and direct answers to naturallanguage questions in the form of algorithmic search results andor responses from other askcom users the success of this initiative depends primarily upon our ability to develop a community of askcom users with the expertise necessary to provide accurate and authoritative answers to questions as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative in the case of the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering users unique searchrelated features such as ask eraser  which when activated by users who enter search queries on askcom  deletes from our servers search queries and related cookie and other information used to track internet activity

receive with the applicable third party citygrid property revenues are also generated through our sale of local merchant and national display advertising on our owned and operated properties on a per impression and fixed fee basis

risk factors 

mr diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board or directors matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations 

as of january 31 2011 mr diller owned approximately 43 million shares of iac class b common stock representing 100 of iacs outstanding class b common stock and approximately 338 of the total outstanding voting power of iac mr diller may acquire additional shares of iac class b common stock through the exercise of an exchange right pursuant to which he may exchange with iac on a oneforone basis from time to time until september 1 2011 up to 15 million shares of iac common stock he acquires in the open market or otherwise for shares of iac class b common stock currently held in treasury by iac 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement among iac and mr diller for so long as mr diller serves as iacs chairman and senior executive he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iacs ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelvemonth period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr dillers ownership interest voting power and the contractual rights described above mr diller currently is in a position to influence subject to our organizational documents and delaware law the composition of iacs board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers business combinations and dispositions of assets among other corporate transactions in addition this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly our senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our search services that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through google in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us as well as certain other searchrelated services 

the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements and the efficiency of googles system 

in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries in addition google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search services and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive changes to googles paid listings network efficiency or its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search services could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such changes could come about for a number of reasons including general market conditions competition or policy and operating decisions made by google 

our paid listing supply agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its services and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings specifically the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display google paid listings within search results subject to certain limitations google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines which could in turn require modifications to or prohibit certain of our products services andor business practices which could be costly or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with googles guidelines by us or third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings could if not cured result in googles suspension of some or all services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google 

the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit in the recent past adverse economic conditions have caused and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media accordingly we continue to compete with traditional media including television radio and print in addition to a 

multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market we believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure andor optin policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into users and customers 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes to users through third parties these agreements are generally not exclusive are short term in nature and are terminable by either party upon notice our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic queries and advertising revenues which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of the businesses within our match segment we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register on our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees these arrangements are generally not exclusive are short term in nature and are terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our servicemagic business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of service professionals who are members of our service provider network while these professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long term contracts with them in addition a significant number of our service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of service professionals may experience turnover from time to time which if significant or recurring over a prolonged period could result in a decrease in traffic to servicemagiccom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in costeffective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in decreases in users customers and revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new products services and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs in the case of paid advertising generally the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services which could affect our ability to compete effectively and in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other nonsearch related categories and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards coupled with frequent and related new product and service introductions and enhancements the development of new product and service introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes or appropriately time the introduction of new products services and enhancements to the market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the continued widespread adoption of new internet and telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example user and usage volumes on mobile devices continue to increase relative to those of personal computers the lower resolution functionality display limitations and memory associated with mobile devices could make the use of our various services through these devices difficult while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our services we have limited experience with these applications and they may not be compelling to users furthermore existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to cover the provision of our services on mobile devices which the counterparties may be unwilling to do 

furthermore in the case of certain of our search services third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new technologies applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of our users to access or utilize some of our services generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services such as through the introduction and features andor processes that make the access and use of our services cumbersome relative to those of our competitors for example third parties have introduced technologies and applications that prevent users from downloading toolbars generally andor have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will download our toolbars and that previously downloaded toolbars will remain in active use such as features that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and other settings previously selected by users third parties have also introduced technologies and applications that are either not compatible with or otherwise interfere with the search assistant function embedded within our toolbars pursuant to which our toolbars generate search results for users that receive dns 404 and other errors in response to search queries entered into search boxes embedded within our toolbars or the address bar of their web browsers these technologies and applications adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our toolbars which in turn adversely impacts our revenues our failure to successfully modify our toolbars in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions although we believe our tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate relevant taxing authorities may disagree the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income 

tax provisions and accruals any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

• successfully integrate the operations as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems • retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and • successfully manage acquisitionrelated strain on the management operations and financial resources of iac andor acquired businesses we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in certain international markets in which we have limited experience and as a result face additional risks we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into existing international markets 

we currently operate in a limited number of jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the us moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth 

operating abroad where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures the staffing of foreign operations exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms given that we could encounter significant barriers to entry in connection with expansion efforts outside of these arrangements 

a variety of new laws or new interpretations of existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies some of these laws such as income sales use valueadded and other tax laws and consumer protection laws are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the type of businesses in which we are engaged many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the 

internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain for example laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroad claims could be threatened and filed under both us and foreign law for defamation libel slander invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity copyright and trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our products and services or content generated by us and our users 

in addition the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act those of our businesses that mention or otherwise incorporate copyrighted material into the content they produce also rely on fair use principles which allow limited use of copyrighted materials without having to obtain the consent of the copyright holder provided we satisfy certain legal criteria also the childrens online privacy protection act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act we face similar risks and costs as our products services and content are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to consumers specifically in the case of tax laws positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities and while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position and if so that such positions will not adversely affect us any events of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data in connection with the processing of search queries the provision of online services transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

there are currently pending several bills in the us congress which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed additionally the us federal trade commission released a staff report in december 2010 in which it proposed a new framework for addressing commercial use of consumer data we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in the practices andor privacy policies of our various businesses which 

could be costly to implement or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that otherwise negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses also we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within our principal reporting segments our search match and servicemagic reporting segments rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom  our various toolbar brands matchcom and servicemagiccom and related domain names and logos through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew related trademarks upon their expiration they will continue to have related trademark protections indefinitely under current trademark laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search segment also rely heavily upon trade secrets primarily search algorithms through which organic search results are generated to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to searchrelated products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027 and copyrighted material primarily emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of toolbars generally 

our match segment also relies upon patentpending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services our servicemagic segment also relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of local service professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these precautions our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brand names and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure and those of third parties system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our businesses 

to succeed our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our various websites increases and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we do not do so or if we experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts users customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our services on an intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of their experiences could be adversely affected moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems infrastructure and technology needed in order to access our services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide services andor process certain transactions with customers furthermore data security breaches as a result of the actions of hackers or otherwise fire power loss telecommunications failure natural disasters acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs applications and activity that make changes to users computers and interfere with the overall experience of our services such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without 

disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them in addition downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computer or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

on may 20 2005 the plaintiffs in the federal securities class action filed a consolidated amended complaint like its twelve predecessors the amended complaint generally alleged that the value of the companys stock was artificially inflated by preannouncement statements about the companys financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by the companys then travel businesses the plaintiffs sought to represent a class of shareholders who purchased iac common stock between march 31 2003 and august 3 2004 the defendants were iac and fourteen current or former officers or directors of the company or its former expedia travel business the complaint purported to assert claims under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder as well as sections 11 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 and sought damages in an unspecified amount

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

iac is a leading internet company with more than 50 brands serving consumer audiences across more than 30 countries…our mission is to harness the power of interactivity to make daily life easier and more productive for people all over the world iac includes the businesses comprising its search segment its match and servicemagic segments the businesses comprising its media  other segment as well as investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

results 

set forth below are the contributions made by our various segments and corporate operations to consolidated revenue operating income loss and operating income before amortization as defined in iacs principles of financial reporting for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 dollars in thousands 



  



  



refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations by segment of operating income before amortization to operating income loss 

sources of revenue 

substantially all of the revenue from our search segment is derived from online advertising with the majority of this revenue attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with google inc google the revenue earned from our match segment is derived from subscription fees for its subscriptionbased online personals services and online advertising servicemagics revenue is derived from fees paid by members of its network of service professionals for consumer leads regardless of whether the service professional that receives the lead ultimately provides the requested service as well as from onetime fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in its network the revenue earned by the media  other segment includes merchandise sales online advertising and content production 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising spend 

our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit while we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future 

a significant component of the companys revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google which expires on december 31 2012 the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations if any of these events were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if an alternate were found the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 revenue earned from google was 7279 million 5619 million and 6107 million respectively the majority of this revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the search segment 

we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and membership programs allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our toolbars integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels such as internet portals and search engines in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties which compete with those we offer 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which iacs businesses operate increases 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

consolidated results

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization of noncash marketing 3 amortization and impairment of intangibles 4 goodwill impairment 5 pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions and 6 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation noncash marketing and acquisitionrelated accounting 

pro forma results 

we will only present operating income before amortization on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature for the periods presented in this report there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with the securities and exchange commission rules for the periods presented in this report there are no onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of stock options restricted stock units and restricted stock these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for stock options and restricted stock units are included on a treasury method basis upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of noncash marketing consists of noncash advertising credits secured from universal television as part of the transaction pursuant to which vue was created and the subsequent transaction by which iac sold its partnership interests in vue collectively referred to as nbc universal advertising the nbc universal advertising was available for television advertising on 

various nbc universal network and cable channels without any cash cost there are no nbc universal advertising credits available as all credits were used prior to december 31 2009 

the nbc universal advertising is excluded from operating income before amortization because it is noncash and generally is incremental to the advertising the company otherwise secures as a result of its ordinary costbenefit marketing planning process accordingly the companys aggregate level of advertising and the increased concentration of that advertising on nbc universal network and cable channels does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits as a result management believes that treating the nbc universal advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true costbenefit relationship nor does it best reflect the companys longterm level of advertising expenditures nonetheless while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine and especially so with respect to the nbc universal advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration it is likely that the company does derive benefits from it though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above operating income before amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense 

  amortization of intangibles including impairment of intangibles if applicable and goodwill impairment if applicable are noncash expenses relating to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the identifiable definitelived intangible assets of the acquired company such as customer lists technology and supplier agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks and goodwill that are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill if applicable are not ongoing costs of doing business 

reconciliation of operating income before amortization 

for a reconciliation of operating income before amortization to operating income loss by business and to net earnings loss attributable to iac shareholders in total for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of the companys acquired trade names and trademarks are tested annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the shoebuy and iac search  media reporting units and in 2009 related to the iac search  media reporting unit these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is 9895 million and 2370 million respectively at december 31 2010 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units assumptions used in the dcf analyses including the discount rate are assessed annually based on the reporting units current results and forecast as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 20 in both 2010 and 2009 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset 

exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses including the discount rate and royalty rate are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors the discount rates used in the companys annual indefinitelived impairment assessment ranged from 13 to 20 in both 2010 and 2009 and the royalty rates used ranged from 1 to 10 in both 2010 and 2009 

the company has six reporting units with goodwill of these iac search  media and shoebuy have fair values closest to their carrying values the amount of goodwill of each of these reporting units is 5340 million and 217 million respectively at december 31 2010 to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges related to potential future changes in estimated fair values had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10 as of october 1 2010 their estimated fair values would exceed their carrying values had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20 as of october 1 2010 the carrying values of iac search  media and shoebuy would have exceeded their fair values by approximately 9 million and 3 million respectively if operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results future and in the case of iac search  media potentially material impairments of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets could occur 

any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2010 the company did not record any impairment charges related to definitelived intangible assets during 2009 the company recorded an impairment charge related to the definitelived intangible assets of iac search  media the definitelived intangible asset impairment charge primarily related to certain technology and advertiser relationships the carrying values of which were no longer considered recoverable based upon an assessment of future cash flows related to these assets accordingly these assets were written down to fair value in 2009 the value of longlived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment is 2760 million at december 31 2010 

marketable securities 

the company invests in certain marketable securities which consist primarily of shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us government agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of a security sold or the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis which may be maturity if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investment in marketable securities to decline during 2010 the company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be otherthantemporarily impaired during 2009 the company sold its 55 million shares of aro stock resulting in aggregate losses of 123 million prior to the sale of its last 11 million shares of aro stock the company concluded that the decline in the stock price of these remaining shares was otherthantemporary due in part to aros insolvency filing on june 9 2009 and recorded impairment charges totaling 46 million 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it is assessed that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors including the length of time accounts receivable are past due the companys previous loss history the specific customers ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the customers industry the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible the company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments the amount of these reserves are based in part on historical experience as of december 31 2010 the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is 88 million 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2010 the balance of deferred tax assets net is 1462 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the irs as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon 

ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

stock based compensation 

as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2010 2009 and 2008 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 24 21 and 26 respectively a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 30 59 and 47 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac for 2010 and peer companies operating in the same industry sector as iac for 2009 and 2008 and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 56 years 49 years and 44 years respectively the historical stock price volatilities in 2009 and 2008 of peer companies was used due to the lack of sufficient historical iac stock price volatilities subsequent to the spinoff for stock options including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2010 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of 15 million 77 million and 50 million respectively the company also issues restricted stock units and performance stock units for restricted stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performance stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and longterm debt 

investment portfolio 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities which consist primarily of money market instruments and shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us governmental agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

based on the companys total investment in marketable debt securities as of december 31 2010 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the debt investment securities by 32 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately 7421 million is invested in shortterm fixed or variable rate money market instruments the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

longterm debt 

at december 31 2010 the companys outstanding debt approximated 958 million all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 105 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

at december 31 2010 the company has two investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies one of these investments is the companys investment in meetic which is accounted for using the equity method the other investment is an availableforsale marketable equity security the investment in meetic is included in longterm investments and the availableforsale marketable equity security is included in marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the availableforsale marketable equity security is reported at fair value based on its quoted market price with any unrealized gain or loss net of tax included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market among other factors during 2010 the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment charges related to its availableforsale marketable equity security it is not customary for the company to make significant investments in equity securities as part of its marketable securities investment strategy 

iac holds approximately 61 million shares of common stock a 27 stake in meetic an online dating company based in france meetics shares are listed on the euronext stock exchange epa meet as a result iac is exposed to changes in meetics stock price the investment in meetic is accounted for using the equity method and the company records its share of the results of meetic and related amortization of intangibles on a onequarter lag within equity in losses income of unconsolidated affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations the carrying value of the meetic investment is 1300 million at december 31 2010 which is lower than the carrying value of 1565 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a dividend of 114 million the fair value of the meetic investment based on its quoted market price is 1300 million at december 31 2010 because our investment in meetic is accounted for using the equity method it is not reported at fair value in the event the fair value of meetic were to decline below its carrying value this decline would be only one factor in an assessment for otherthantemporary impairment 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling and euro however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 17 15 and 20 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the statements of operations of the companys international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues and operating income similarly the companys revenue and operating income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings in 2010 2009 and 2008 as currency exchange rates change translation of the income statements of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency translation risks the companys objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

description of iac businesses 

search 

overview 

our search segment consists primarily of askcom and other destination search websites through which we provide search and related advertising services as well as toolbars and applications through which we promote and distribute these services and citysearch a leading online local city guide 

search business 

overview search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites together with summary information regarding these websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users we provide search services to users who visit our askcom and other destination search websites and portals directly through toolbars that we distribute to users directly and through third parties and through the syndication of our search results via search boxes placed on third party websites substantially all of the revenue of our search business and our search segment is derived from the display of paid listings and other advertising in connection with the provision of search services 

display of paid listings and other advertising in addition to algorithmic search results paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages in response to search queries that contain advertiserselected keywords a paid listing is a short textual unit containing a link to the website of an advertiser that purchased the relevant keywords the advertiser generally pays a fixed fee every time a user clicks on the paid listing 

a substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement we transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from our algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages to a lesser extent we also syndicate google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements see item 1a—risk factors—we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we sell paid listings directly to advertisers and display them on third party and various iac properties as well as sell display advertising on our portals and other iac properties 

toolbars and applications through mindspark interactive network inc mindspark we develop market and distribute a variety of downloadable toolbars through which users can access our search services as well as applications through which users creatively and visually express themselves and interact online which we generally refer to as our funwebproducts suite of applications we market and distribute our toolbars together with the funwebproducts suite of applications directly to consumers these toolbars which we offer free of charge generally consist of a search box powered by askcom or a third party search engine plus the funwebproducts suite of additional features the search box enables users to run search queries directly from their web browser and the suite of features enables users to personalize their online activities and otherwise make them more expressive and fun these features include among other applications smiley central  through which users can add emoticons to emails and instant messages webfetti  through which users can personalize their pages on various social networking websites mywebface  through which users can create cartoonlike images of themselves for download or use in connection with their profile pages on social networks and zwinky  through which users can create avatars to express their persona on the web and design and update profile pages to share with friends zwinky also provides users with access to zwinktopia  a virtual world where avatars created by users can interact through chat and other features as well as purchase virtual items with virtual currency online we also market and distribute our toolbars through the ask partner network to third parties who in turn bundle our toolbars with their applications and websites 

destinations sites and portals we also operate a number of destination websites and portals through which we provide search and additional services including dictionarycom  a destination website that provides online dictionary search and related services girlsensecom  a destination website that provides a virtual fashion community for girls and teens wwwmywaycom  which is free from banner popup and richmedia ads and through which we provide email services wwwexcitecom  a contentrich portal that aggregates news sports weather and entertainment content and wwwiwoncom  which offers an extensive variety of casual games and sweepstakes 

revenues substantially all of the revenues of our search business and the search segment are derived from advertising with the substantial majority of these revenues attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with google when a user submits a search query through our search services and clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and makes a related revenue share payment to us which we either retain in its entirety or share with third parties in some cases google does not charge advertisers unless our user after clicking on the paid listing also takes certain actions on the advertisers website to a lesser extent we also generate revenues from the direct sale of paid listings directly to advertisers on a costperclick basis as well as from the sale of display advertising on a fixed fee per impression basis 

competition we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract search engine users distribute downloadable toolbars and applications attract third parties to distribute our toolbars and search boxes and attract advertisers including google yahoo msn and other destination search websites and searchcentric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers including internet access providers social networks online advertising networks traditional media companies and companies that provide online content 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the search business will depend primarily upon the following factors 

• the relevance and authority of our search results and other content and • the functionality of our various websites and the quality of related content and features as well as the attractiveness of our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors in the case of the relevance and authority of our search results our current goal is to provide accurate and authoritative answers to queries phrased in the form of direct questions which we seek to achieve through a combination of search results generated by our proprietary search technology and answers provided by our users to frequently asked questions in the case of the functionality of our various websites and the quality of related content and features we seek to differentiate ourselves from other search service providers through the following features 

• dedicated search channels —in addition to traditional general internet searches users may conduct searches on separate channels dedicated to news images videos recipes coupons and bargains among other categories of activities and interests • related and suggested search —users entering search queries are simultaneously presented with a list of suggested search queries and related search topics and • ask eraser —users who enter search queries on our askcom destination search websites may elect to activate this feature which deletes from our servers search queries and related cookie and other information used to track internet activity in addition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our mindspark business will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars that resonate with consumers market and distribute toolbars directly to consumers in a costeffective manner and secure costeffective toolbar distribution arrangements with third parties and through other means as well attract advertisers

competition the markets for local content local services and local advertising are highly competitive and diverse while we primarily compete with online and offline local and national directories we currently face increasing competition from search engines and other site aggregation companies that pull content from citysearchcom for display on their websites as well as other destination websites generally which adversely impacts our ability to monetize this content and interferes with search engine marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to citysearchcom  we also compete with online advertising networks online and offline providers of local content telecommunications and cable companies internet service providers and niche competitors that focus on a specific category or geography and compete with specific content offerings that we provide

this annual report on form 10k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the use of words such as anticipates estimates expects projects intends plans and believes among others generally identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include among others statements relating to iacs anticipated financial performance iacs business prospects and strategy anticipated trends and prospects in the various industries in which iac businesses operate new products services and related strategies and other similar matters these forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions about future events which are inherently subject to uncertainties risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict

risk factors 

mr diller currently controls iac if mr diller ceases to control iac liberty media corporation may effectively control iac 

subject to the terms of an amended and restated stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty mr diller has an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of iac common stock and iac class b common stock held by liberty accordingly as of the date of this report mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of iac stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of iac common stock of 25 of the members of iacs board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr dillers permanent departure from iac the irrevocable proxy terminates and depending upon the capitalization of iac at such time liberty may effectively control the voting power of the capital stock of iac through its ownership of iac class b common stock 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement among iac liberty and mr diller mr diller generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iacs ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 41 over a continuous 12month period while mr diller may not currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not be triggered in the future and if so that mr diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr dillers ownership interests and voting power and libertys ownership interests and voting power mr diller currently is and upon mr dillers permanent departure from iac in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including without limitation corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to iacs significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

furthermore given this concentrated control iac currently falls within the definition of a controlled company within the meaning of the marketplace rules of the nasdaq stock market the marketplace rules as a controlled company iac is permitted and has elected to opt out of certain corporate governance requirements in the marketplace rules applicable to noncontrolled companies specifically those that would otherwise require i iacs board of directors to have a majority of independent directors within the meaning of the marketplace rules and ii nominations to iacs board of directors to be selected or recommended for selection either by a nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors or by a majority of independent directors accordingly iac stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the marketplace rules 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon the continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of senior management particularly barry diller the chairman and ceo of iac being especially critical to our success if mr diller no longer serves in or serves in some lesser capacity than his current role our business financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price of iac securities could be adversely affected competition for wellqualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees particularly senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of mr diller other members of senior management or any other key 

employees in the future mr diller does not have an employment agreement with iac though he owns approximately 43 million shares of iac common stock and holds unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares of iac common stock all of which vest in june 2010 and expire in june 2015 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement google sells paid listings directly to advertisers which we in turn display and syndicate in response to user search queries that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through google in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements and the efficiency of googles system in attracting advertisers and serving up relevant paid listings in response to queries in addition our revenue will be impacted by the effectiveness in terms of ultimately generating revenue for googles advertisers of clicks from users of our search services if googles performance were to deteriorate for any reason or if our traffic fails to generate revenue for googles advertisers revenues we receive from google pursuant to the paid listing supply agreement would decrease which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our paid listing supply agreement requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of certain third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings specifically the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display google paid listings within search results noncompliance with these requirements could if not cured result in the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings and would give google the right to terminate the paid listing supply agreement the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if this were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if so the terms of the agreements and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather the current economic environment as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit the continuing adverse economic conditions generally have caused and we expect that they may continue to cause decreases andor delays in both advertising and consumer expenditures as well as related decreases in queries likely to generate revenue any of which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media accordingly we continue to compete with traditional media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks for a share of available advertising expenditures we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings would have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

we depend in part upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into users and customers 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally 

for example in an effort to increase traffic to our destination search websites we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes to users through third parties these agreements are generally not exclusive are for a short term and are terminable by either party given notice our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties would result in a decrease in traffic to our destination search websites and in turn related decreases in queries and advertising revenues which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in the case of our match business we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our personals websites pursuant to these arrangements third parties generally promote our services on their websites and we pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click though to our personals websites these arrangements are generally not exclusive are for a short term and are terminable by either party given notice if existing arrangements with third parties are terminated or are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with third parties in response to industry trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the case of our servicemagic business our ability to drive traffic depends in part on the nature and number of the third party service professionals who are members of our service provider network while these professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long term contracts with them in addition a significant number of our service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to economic downturns constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of service professionals may experience turnover from time to time which if significant or recurring over a prolonged basis could result in a decrease in traffic to servicemagiccom and increased costs all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our destination search and other websites we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users unless we continue to provide quality products and services that resonate with consumers we may not be able to adapt quickly andor in costeffective 

manner to frequent changes in user and customer requirements which can be difficult to predict or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements andor new products or services to the market our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences which would result in a decrease in traffic to our various websites lower conversion rates and a related decrease in revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below these traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new services products and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or costeffective 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective in the case of our search engine marketing efforts our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase as well as adversely affect the pricing of the online advertising we purchase generally which would increase our costs 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing users and members is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well in search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

lastly as discussed above we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic which arrangements are generally more costeffective than traditional marketing efforts if we are unable to renew existing and enter into new arrangements of this nature sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

any such failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards coupled with frequent and related new service and product introductions and enhancements the development of new service and product introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes or appropriately time the introduction of new services and products to the market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example user and usage volumes on mobile devices continue to increase relative to those of personal computers the lower resolution functionality and memory associated with mobile devices could make the use of our various services through these devices difficult while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our services we have limited experience with these applications and they may not be compelling to users furthermore existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to cover the provision of our services on mobile devices which the counterparties may be unwilling to do 

furthermore in the case of our search services third parties have introduced and continue to introduce new technologies and applications that may interfere with the ability of our users to access or utilize some of our services generally for example third parties have introduced technologies and applications that prevent users from downloading toolbars generally andor have features that significantly lessen the likelihood that previously downloaded toolbars will remain in active use such as features that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of settings previously selected by consumers in connection with the downloading of our toolbars third parties have also introduced technologies and applications that are either not compatible with or otherwise interfere with the search assistant function embedded within our toolbars pursuant to which our toolbars generate search results for users that receive dns 404 and other errors in response to search queries entered into search boxes embedded with our toolbars or the address bar of their web browsers these technologies and applications adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our toolbars which in turns adversely impacts our revenues our failure to successfully modify our toolbars in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

• successfully integrate the operations as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems • retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and • successfully manage acquisitionrelated strain on the management operations and financial resources of iac andor acquired businesses we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in certain international markets in which we have limited experience and as a result face additional risks we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into existing international markets 

we currently operate in a limited number of jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the us moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth 

operating abroad where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks for example we may experience difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures and the staffing of foreign operations as well as exchange rate fluctuations our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms given that we could encounter significant barriers to entry in connection with expansion efforts outside of these arrangements 

a variety of new and existing us and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies the laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroad claims have been threatened and filed under both us and foreign law for defamation libel slander invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity copyright and trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users 

in addition the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for listing or linking to thirdparty web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act the child online protection act and the childrens online privacy protection act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act we face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests or if new adverse laws are adopted our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to consumers as a result any changes of this nature could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data in connection with the processing of search queries and consumer transactions the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

there are currently pending several bills in the us congress which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our practices or privacy policies of our various businesses or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by these businesses the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including trademarks domain names trade secrets patents copyrights and other similar intellectual property as critical to our success for example the businesses within our principal reporting segments our search match and servicemagic reporting segments rely heavily upon their trademarks primarily askcom  funwebproducts  matchcom and servicemagiccom and related domain names and logos through which they market their services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew related trademarks upon their expiration they will continue to have related trademark protections indefinitely under current trademark laws rules and regulations 

the businesses within our search segment also rely heavily upon trade secrets primarily search algorithms through which organic search results are generated to a lesser extent these businesses also rely upon patented and patentpending proprietary technologies and processes primarily those relating to searchrelated products and services with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027 and copyrighted material primarily emoticons characters and other content that is incorporated into and used in connection with the marketing of downloadable toolbars generally 

our match segment also relies upon patentpending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features products and services our servicemagic segment also relies heavily upon trade secrets primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of local service professionals are matched with consumers as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights for example we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew or secure by contract where appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available 

we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate based on then current facts and circumstances and will continue to do so in the future no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own 

despite these precautions our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brand names and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies any of which could adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems may affect our businesses 

to succeed our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or prevent us from providing services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our various websites and the related number of users and customers increase and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we do not do so or if we experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our services on an intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of the usercustomer experience could be adversely affected moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with these efforts third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems infrastructure and technology needed in order to access our services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers any interruptions outages or delays in our 

systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide services andor process certain transactions with customers furthermore data security breaches as a result of the actions of hackers or otherwise fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer data broadband or other communications systems at any time any event of this nature could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs applications and activity that make changes to users computers and interfere with overall experience of our services such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them in addition downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computer or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these adverse events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

sources of revenue 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 search was our largest revenue contributor our search businesses offer information and services via the internet and are compensated directly and indirectly by advertisers generally based on performance and volume related measures our match business offers subscription membership services and our servicemagic business is generally compensated on a fee basis by home service providers who participate in our services 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising spend 

we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and membership programs allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of revenue share payments to third parties that have distributed our toolbars andor integrated paid listings into their websites and similar arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels such as internet portals and search engines in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties that compete with those we offer 

the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which iacs businesses operate increases 

our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit while we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future including advertisers on the businesses within search 

the substantial majority of the paid listings on our search properties is provided by google inc google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement which expires on december 31 2012 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 revenue earned from google was 5648 million 6108 million and 5681 million respectively principally all of this revenue is earned by iac search  media formerly ask jeeves inc which comprises our search properties excluding citysearch 

international operations 

we continue to seek to expand the presence of certain of our brands and businesses abroad primarily in europe and latin america given the large consumer marketplace for the services and goods that our brands and businesses offer we believe foreign markets generally exhibit similar characteristics of the us in regards to customer acceptance of an online marketplace as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 15 19 and 15 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively international revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to the sale of match europe to meetic sa meetic an online dating company based in france on june 5 2009

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization of noncash marketing 3 amortization and impairment of intangibles 4 goodwill impairment 5 pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions and 6 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation noncash marketing and acquisitionrelated accounting 

pro forma results 

we will only present operating income before amortization on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature for the periods presented in this report there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with the securities and exchange commission rules for the periods presented in this report there are no onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of restricted stock restricted stock units and stock options these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for restricted stock units and stock options are included on a treasury method basis upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the exercise of certain stock options the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of noncash marketing consists of noncash advertising credits secured from universal television as part of the transaction pursuant to which vue was created and the subsequent transaction by which iac sold its partnership interests in vue collectively referred to as nbc universal advertising the nbc universal advertising was available for television advertising on 

various nbc universal network and cable channels without any cash cost at december 31 2009 there were no nbc universal advertising credits available as all credits had been used 

the nbc universal advertising is excluded from operating income before amortization because it is noncash and generally is incremental to the advertising the company otherwise secures as a result of its ordinary costbenefit marketing planning process accordingly the companys aggregate level of advertising and the increased concentration of that advertising on nbc universal network and cable channels does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits as a result management believes that treating the nbc universal advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true costbenefit relationship nor does it best reflect the companys longterm level of advertising expenditures nonetheless while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine and especially so with respect to the nbc universal advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration it is likely that the company does derive benefits from it though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above operating income before amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense 

  amortization of intangibles including impairment of intangibles if applicable is a noncash expense relating to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the intangible assets of the acquired company such as technology and supplier agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives value is also assigned to acquired indefinitelived intangible assets which comprise trade names and trademarks which are not subject to amortization an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value while it is likely that we will have intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization is not an ongoing cost of doing business 

reconciliation of operating income before amortization 

for a reconciliation of operating income before amortization to operating loss income by business and to net loss attributable to iac shareholders in total for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which consist of certain of the companys trade names and trademarks are tested annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2009 related to the iac search  media reporting unit and in 2008 related to the connected ventures and iac search  media reporting units these impairment charges are more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is 9994 million and 2457 million respectively at december 31 2009 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the companys reporting units to its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the companys most recent budget and for years beyond the budget the companys estimates which are based in part on forecasted growth rates the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units the discount rates used in the companys annual impairment assessments were the same in 2009 and 2008 if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment if any the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the companys indefinitelived intangible assets consist of acquired trade names and trademarks the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair 

value of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the companys trade names and trademarks the discount rates used in the companys annual impairment assessments were the same in 2009 and 2008 the royalty rates were unchanged from 2008 to 2009 with the exception of the reduced royalty rates used in the determination of the fair values of certain trade names and trademarks of iac search  media 

the company has seven reporting units with goodwill of these iac search  media instantactioncom and connected ventures have fair values that approximate their carrying values the amount of goodwill of each of the reporting units is 5276 million 316 million and 84 million respectively at december 31 2009 if operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results future potentially material impairments of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets could occur to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges relative to future changes in estimated fair values had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10 as of october 1 2009 the carrying values of iac search  media instantactioncom and connected ventures would have exceeded their respective fair values by approximately 80 million 4 million and 4 million respectively had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20 as of october 1 2009 the carrying values of iac search  media instantactioncom and connected ventures would have exceeded their respective fair values by approximately 160 million 8 million and 8 million respectively 

any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but in any event would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value the primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the companys reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability generally the company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result the carrying value of a reporting units exceeds its fair value this assessment would be based in part upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget the companys assessment of macroeconomic factors industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets comprising property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value during 2009 the company recorded an impairment charge related to the definitelived intangible assets of iac search  media the definitelived intangible asset impairment charge primarily relates to certain technology and advertiser relationships the carrying values of which were no longer considered recoverable based upon an assessment of future cash flows related to these assets accordingly these assets were written down to fair value the value of longlived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment is 3128 million at december 31 2009 

marketable securities 

the company invests in certain marketable securities which consist primarily of shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us government agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of a security sold or the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis which may be maturity if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investment in marketable securities to decline during 2008 the company concluded that the decline in the aro stock price was otherthantemporary and wrote the value of the 55 million shares of aro stock down resulting in impairment charges totaling 1667 million the impairment charges were determined to be otherthantemporary due to the significant decline in and the companys assessment of the neartomedium term prospects for a recovery of the aro stock price during 2009 the company sold its 55 million shares of aro stock resulting in aggregate losses of 123 million prior to the sale of its last 11 million shares of aro stock the company concluded that the decline in the stock price of these remaining shares was otherthantemporary due in part to aros insolvency filing on june 9 2009 and recorded impairment charges totaling 46 million 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it is assessed that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors including the length of time accounts receivable are past due the companys previous loss history the specific customers ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the customers industry the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible the company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments the amount of these reserves are based in part on historical experience as of december 31 2009 the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is 113 million 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2009 the balance of deferred tax assets net is 1458 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the irs as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to 

evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

stock based compensation 

as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2009 and 2008 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 21 and 26 respectively a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 59 and 47 respectively based on the historical stock price volatilities of peer companies operating in the same industry sector as iac and a weighted average expected life of the stock options of 49 years and 44 years respectively the historical stock price volatilities of peer companies is used due to the lack of sufficient historical iac stock price volatilities subsequent to the spinoff there were no stock options granted by the company during the year ended december 31 2007 for stock options issued since 2003 including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and amortized over the remaining vesting term the impact on noncash compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2009 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected life of the outstanding options would be an increase of 15 million 77 million and 47 million respectively the company also issues restricted stock units and performance stock units for restricted stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and amortized ratably as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performance stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and longterm debt 

investment portfolio 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable securities which consist primarily of money market instruments and shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us governmental agencies states of the us and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

based on the companys total debt investment securities as of december 31 2009 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the debt investment securities by 34 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash balance of approximately 12 billion is invested in variable rate interest earning assets the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

longterm debt 

at december 31 2009 the companys outstanding debt approximated 958 million all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 103 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk

as part of the consideration for the sale of hse to aro on june 19 2007 iac received approximately 55 million shares of aro stock plus additional consideration in the form of a cvr aro shares are listed on the german stock exchange xetra aro and as a result iac is exposed to changes in aros stock price aro filed for insolvency on june 9 2009 which accelerated the maturity date of the cvr the aro stock is an availableforsale marketable equity security the cvr is accounted for as a derivative asset and maintained at fair value each reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized in current earnings as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations each period during 2009 the company sold its 55 million shares of aro stock resulting in aggregate losses of 123 million prior to the sale of its last 11 million shares of aro stock the company concluded that the decline in the stock price of these remaining shares was otherthantemporary due in part to aros insolvency filing and recorded impairment charges totaling 46 million in addition during 2009 the company recorded a writedown totaling 581 million related to the cvr based upon the companys assessment of the value that it expects to recover from the insolvency proceedings the impairment charges related to the shares of aro stock and the loss related to the writedown of the cvr are included in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

on october 25 2004 iac made an investment in opentable a provider of online restaurant reservations the purchase price of the investment was 151 million in cash and was accounted for under the cost method on may 21 2009 opentable became a public company trading on the nasdaq stock exchange nasdaq open and as a result iac is exposed to changes in opentables stock price as a result of this transaction iac no longer accounts for its investment using the cost method of accounting but rather accounts for such investment as an availableforsale marketable equity security during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 the company sold 18 million and 02 million shares of opentable stock respectively resulting in gains of 362 million and 34 million respectively the carrying value of the opentable investment is 49 million at december 31 2009 the related unrealized gain of 21 million net of deferred taxes is included in other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 15 19 and 15 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the statements of operations of the companys international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues and operating income similarly the companys revenue and operating income will increase for our international operations if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the 

company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings in 2009 2008 and 2007 as currency exchange rates change translation of the income statements of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency translation risks the companys objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

description of iac businesses 

media  advertising 

our media  advertising segment consists primarily of our search business which includes askcom and other destination search websites through which we provide search and related advertising services and toolbars and applications through which we promote and distribute these services citysearch a leading online local city guide and evite an online social planning website 

search business 

overview search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites together with a brief summary of information regarding these websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users we provide search services to users who visit our askcom and other destination search websites and portals directly through toolbars that we distribute to users directly through toolbars and search boxes that we distribute to users through third parties and through the syndication of our search results substantially all of the revenue of our search business and media  advertising are derived from the display of paid listings and other advertising in connection with the provision of search services 

display of paid listings and other advertising in addition to algorithmic search results paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages in response to search queries that contain advertiserselected keywords a paid listing is a short textual unit containing a link to the website of an advertiser that purchased the relevant keywords the advertiser generally pays a fixed fee every time a user clicks on the paid listing 

a substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement we transmit search queries to google which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results this adserving process occurs independently of but concurrently with the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries google paid listings are displayed separately from our algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages to a lesser extent we also syndicate google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements see item 1a—risk factors—we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also sell paid listings directly to advertisers through ask sponsored listings asl paid listings purchased through asl are displayed on the approximately 100 online properties and services affiliated with asls distribution network including iac properties lastly we also sell display advertising on our portals and other iac properties through iac advertising solutions 

toolbars and applications through mindspark interactive network inc we develop market and distribute a variety of downloadable toolbars and applications through which users can access our search services as well as creatively and visually express themselves and interact online which we generally refer to as our funwebproducts toolbars our toolbars which we offer free of charge generally consist of a search box that we power in whole or in part plus a suite of additional features the search box enables users to run search queries directly from their web browser and through the suite of features users can personalize their online activities and otherwise make them more expressive and fun these features include among other applications smiley central  through which users can add emoticons to emails and instant messages webfetti  through which users can personalize their pages on various social networking websites and zwinky  through which users can create avatars to express their persona on the web and design and update profile pages to share with friends zwinky also provides users with access to zwinktopia  a virtual world where avatars created by users can interact through chat and other features as well as purchase virtual items with virtual currency online 

portals we also operate the following portals through which we provide search and additional services wwwmywaycom  which is free from banner popup and richmedia ads and through which we provide email services wwwexcitecom  a contentrich portal that aggregates news sports weather and entertainment content and wwwiwoncom  which offers an extensive variety of casual games and sweepstakes 

revenues substantially all of the revenues of our search business and the media  advertising segment are derived from advertising with the substantial majority of these revenues attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with google when a user submits a search query through our search services and clicks on a google paid listing displayed in response to the query google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and makes a related revenue share payment to us which we either retain in its entirety or share with third parties in some cases google does not charge advertisers unless our user after clicking on the ad also takes certain actions on the advertisers website to a lesser extent we also generate revenues from the sale of paid listings directly to advertisers on a costperclick basis through asl as well as from the sale of display advertising on a fixed fee per impression basis through iac advertising solutions 

competition we compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract search engine users distribute downloadable toolbars and applications attract third parties to distribute our toolbars and search boxes and attract advertisers including google yahoo msn and other destination search websites and searchcentric portals some of which provide a broad range of content and services andor link to various desktop applications third party toolbar convenience search and applications providers other search technology and convenience service providers social networks online advertising networks and traditional media companies 

moreover some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger customer bases andor significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us

risk factors 

mr diller currently controls iac if mr diller ceases to control iac liberty media corporation may effectively control iac 

subject to the terms of an amended and restated stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty mr diller has an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of iac common stock and iac class b common stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of iac stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of iac common stock of 25 of the members of iacs board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr dillers permanent departure from iac the irrevocable proxy terminates and depending upon the capitalization of iac at such time liberty may effectively control the voting power of the capital stock of iac through its ownership of iac common stock and iac class b common stock 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement among iac liberty and mr diller each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iacs ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 41 over a continuous 12month period while neither of mr diller nor liberty may currently exercise this right no assurances can be given that this right will not be triggered in the future and if so that mr diller and liberty will consent to any of the limited matters at such time in which case iac would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right 

as a result of mr dillers ownership interests and voting power and libertys ownership interests and voting power upon mr dillers permanent departure from iac mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including without limitation corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to iacs significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities 

we depend on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon the continued ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled individuals with the continued contributions of senior management particularly barry diller the chairman and ceo of iac being especially critical to our success if mr diller no longer serves in or serves in some lesser capacity than his current role our business financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price of iac securities could be adversely affected competition for well qualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to attract new employees while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives for and retain existing employees particularly senior management we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of mr diller other members of senior management or any other key employees in the future mr diller does not have an employment agreement with iac though he owns approximately 43 million shares of iac common stock and holds unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares of iac common stock all of which vest in june 2010 and expire in june 2015 

we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with google that expires on december 31 2012 pursuant to this agreement google sells paid listings directly to advertisers which we in turn display and syndicate in response to user search queries that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through google in exchange for making our search traffic available to google we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control including the amount google charges for advertisements and the efficiency of googles system in attracting advertisers and serving up relevant ads in response to queries in addition our revenue will be impacted by the effectiveness in terms of ultimately generating revenue for googles advertisers of clicks from users of our search services if googles performance were to deteriorate for any reason or if our traffic fails to generate revenue for googles advertisers revenues we receive from google pursuant to the paid listing supply agreement would decrease which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our paid listing supply agreement requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of certain third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings specifically the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display google paid listings within search results noncompliance with these requirements could if not cured result in the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings and would give google the right to terminate the paid listing supply agreement the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by google or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if this were to occur we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider or if so the terms of the agreements and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with and the paid listings supplied by google or otherwise replace the lost revenues 

general economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to advertising accordingly we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends given that they are not as well situated to weather the current economic environment as their larger competitors which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit the continuing deterioration in economic conditions generally has caused and we expect that it may continue to cause decreases andor delays in advertising expenditures and decreases in queries likely to generate revenue one or both of which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising particularly paid listings as an effective alternative to traditional offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet 

many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media accordingly we continue to compete with traditional media including television radio and print in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic for a share of available advertising expenditures we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend to a large extent on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models the continued growth in commercial use of the internet particularly abroad the extent to which software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud any lack of growth in the market for online advertising particularly for paid listings would have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the failure to continue to drive and increase visitors to our various websites and convert these visitors into users and customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert these visitors into repeat users and customers how successful we are in these efforts depends in part upon our continued ability to enter into agreements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites as well as to develop and introduce new services and products that resonate with users and customers generally we may not be able to adapt quickly andor cost effectively to frequent changes in user and customer requirements which can be difficult to predict any such failure to do so could adversely affect user and customer experiences and reduce traffic driven to our various websites which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of our search business in an effort to increase traffic we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties these agreements are generally not exclusive are for a short term are terminable by either party given notice and may not be renewed upon expiration moreover in the case of toolbars generally even with third party agreements in place we may not be able to maintain and continue to grow our active toolbar installed base to do so we must continue to update existing and create new toolbars that resonate with users and we must effectively market and promote these toolbars 

our inability to enter into new or renew existing agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties maintain and grow our active toolbar base or otherwise develop new products and services in response to changing user and customer preferences would result in a decrease in traffic to our search websites and in turn related decreases in queries and related advertising revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we succeed in driving traffic to our search websites we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users which requires us to continue to improve the search experience for users through the improvement of search relevance and speed and the development of services 

responsive to user needs and preferences our failure to do so could result in decreases in our user base and related queries and advertising revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the case of our online personals business we are currently a party to a number of strategic alliances with third parties the most significant of which is with msn if these arrangements are not renewed upon their expiration and we fail to replace this traffic in a costeffective manner or otherwise replace related revenue our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely effected in addition users of online personal services are fragmenting across the internet to websites that provide free online personal services as well as social networking websites if this fragmentation continues and increases we may need to develop products and technologies with features that compliment or otherwise work with those offered through these websites which could be costly as well as enter into related strategic alliances in an effort to continue to drive and convert traffic to our websites 

in the case of our online home services businesses our ability to drive traffic to our websites also depends in part on the nature and number of the home services professionals in our service provider network while home service professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions we do not enter into long term contracts with home service professionals in addition a significant number of our home service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses which are particularly sensitive to economic downturns constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending as a result our network of home service professionals may experience turnover from time to time which if significant or recurring over a prolonged basis could result in lower conversion rates increased costs and an adverse impact on the quality of services ultimately provided generally all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as discussed below these traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing as well as for the development and introduction of new services products and enhancements infrastructure and other related efforts 

the failure to drive and increase visitors to our various websites in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures for search engine marketing primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives which may not be successful or costeffective we generally also enter and expect to continue to enter into affiliate agreements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic and conversion affiliates generally promote our services on their websites and we pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click though to our websites affiliate agreements are generally not exclusive are for a short term are terminable by either party given notice and may not be renewed upon expiration if the amount of traffic being driven to our websites through our affiliate arrangements which are generally more cost effective than traditional marketing efforts were to decrease significantly sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the longterm 

one of the most costeffective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new and retain existing members and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization or seo seo involves developing websites to rank well in search engine results search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our businesses including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms search query trends and related efforts by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in 

search results could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic any or all of which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our failure to respond successfully to the changes effected by providers of search services described above could also negatively affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords that we purchase which would adversely affect our paid search engine marketing efforts and our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to attract and acquire new and retain existing traffic users and customers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we will need to 

• successfully integrate the operations as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems • retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses and • successfully manage acquisitionrelated strain on the management operations and financial resources of iac andor acquired businesses we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events andor trends which could result in significant impairment charges the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards coupled with frequent and related new service and product introductions and enhancements the development of new service and product introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to these changes and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer has increased dramatically the lower resolution functionality and memory associated with these devices could make the use of services we provide through these devices difficult and we have limited experience in operating alternative services for these devices which may not be compelling to users furthermore existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to cover the provision of our services through these technologies and devices which the counterparties may be unwilling to do 

in addition our failure to successfully modify our toolbars in a costeffective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies and applications that adversely impact our ability to generate search assistant revenues could adversely effect our business financial condition and results of operations once installed our toolbars typically generate revenues by among other things acting as search assistants for users that receive dns 404 and other errors in response to search queries as well as users who conduct searches through the address bar of their web browsers in the case of these search queries our toolbars direct users to the desired website or offer a set of suggestions intended to satisfy the deemed intent of the original search queries recently other providers of search services and third parties that drive traffic to their websites have introduced new technologies and applications that are either not compatible with or otherwise interfere with the search assistant function embedded within our toolbars 

we operate in certain international markets in which we have limited experience and as a result face additional risks we may not be able to successfully expand into new or further into existing international markets 

we currently operate in a limited number of jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the us moreover we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth 

operating abroad where we have limited experience exposes us to additional risks including difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with establishing management systems and infrastructures staffing foreign operations and exchange rate fluctuations our success in international markets will also depend in part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms given that we could encounter significant barriers to entry in connection with expansion efforts outside of these arrangements 

a variety of new and existing us and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that are costly to comply with can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies the laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroad claims have been threatened and filed under both us and foreign law for defamation libel slander invasion of privacy 

and other tort claims unlawful activity copyright and trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users 

in addition the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for listing or linking to thirdparty web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act the child online protection act and the childrens online privacy protection act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act we face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of search queries and consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

there are currently pending several bills in the us congress which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our practices or privacy policies of our various businesses or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by these businesses the failure of any of our businesses or their various third party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our various products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or copyrighted 

intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of our brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we generally seek to apply for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or inventions are identified and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar result without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

our success depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems may affect our businesses 

to succeed our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis from time to time we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or prevent us from providing services which could adversely affect our business moreover as traffic to our various websites and the related number of users and customers increase and the number of new and presumably more complex products and services that we introduce continues to grow we will need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth if we do not do so or if we experience inefficiencies andor operational failures in connection with current or future upgrades third parties with which we do business may not be able to access our services on a intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of experience that users and customers encounter with our products and services generally could diminish moreover even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies or operational failures in connection with upgrades third parties with which we do business may not make the related changes to their systems infrastructure and technology needed in order to access our services on a timely basis if at all the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely on third party computer systems data centers broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers or deterioration in the performance of these systems could impair our ability to provide services andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption 

in particular our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs and applications that make changes to users computers and interfere with overall experience of our services such as by hijacking queries to the these websites or altering or replacing search results generated this type of interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us these disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them in addition downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses worms and other malicious software programs which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users computer or in our systems and networks no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful andor that our products and services will not have or will not be perceived to have vulnerabilities in this regard 

if any of these adverse events were to occur it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy

refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations by segment of operating income before amortization to operating loss income 

sources of revenue 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 media  advertising was our largest financial contributor our media  advertising businesses offer information and services via the internet and are compensated directly and indirectly by advertisers generally based on performance and volume related measures 

our match business offers subscription membership services and our servicemagic business is generally compensated on a fee basis by home service providers who participate in our services 

strategic partnerships advertiser relationships and online advertising spend 

we market and offer our products and services directly to customers through branded websites and membership programs allowing our customers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner we 

have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our businesses 

we pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of revenue share payments to third parties that have distributed our toolbars andor integrated paid listings into their websites and similar arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites we also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels such as internet portals and search engines in addition some of our businesses manage affiliate programs pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services as well as those of other third parties that compete with those made available and offered by our businesses 

the cost of acquiring new customers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which iacs businesses operate increases 

our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit while we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future including advertisers on the businesses within media  advertising 

the substantial majority of the paid listings on our search properties is provided by google inc google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement effective january 1 2008 which expires december 31 2012 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 revenue earned from this arrangement was 6108 million 5681 million and 3790 million respectively principally all of this revenue is earned by iac search  media 

international operations 

we continue to seek to expand the presence of certain of our brands and businesses abroad particularly in europe given the large consumer marketplace for the services and goods that our brands and businesses offer we believe foreign markets generally exhibit similar characteristics of the us in regards to customer acceptance of an online marketplace as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 19 in 2008 and 15 in both 2007 and 2006 international revenue grew approximately 35 in 2008 from 2007 

economic and other trends 

overall adverse economic conditions have affected iacs businesses particularly revenues derived from advertising services provided by the businesses in our media  advertising segment this was reflected in decline in query volumes and slowing growth in monetization of queries at ask and our toolbars business moreover changes we made in the fourth quarter of 2008 to enhance our askcom website and make it more efficient for users has led to fewer queries and reduced monetization as users are finding answers more quickly 

going forward we believe that the current economic environment will continue to adversely impact iacs results as consumers cut back on discretionary spending leading to fewer queries likely to generate revenue and advertisers further pare their budgets we believe however that the enhancements made to the askcom website along with other strategies for growth in our search businesses will result in increased retention and frequency offsetting to some extent the adverse economic impact 

during 2008 servicemagic experienced slowing growth in its higher margin home repair and improvement requests in early 2009 we continue to see a reduction in the rate of growth of service requests while at the same time marketing costs have increased thereby adversely affecting margins it is likely that demand for servicemagics services will continue to be adversely impacted if consumer confidence remains low and consumers delay spending on discretionary home repair and improvement projects lastly while we have not seen any discernible impact from the current economic downturn at match a prolonged continuation or worsening of the recession could adversely affect this business 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

iac consolidated results

revenue in 2007 increased 33 or 3320 million primarily as a result of revenue increases of 2143 million from media  advertising 597 million from emerging businesses 375 million from match and 297 million from servicemagic the revenue growth from media  advertising was driven primarily by an increase in queries from distributed search and paid listings and an increase in both revenue per query and queries at fun web products and ask the contribution from emerging businesses was driven primarily by strong revenue growth at shoebuy and pronto the revenue increase from match was driven by an 11 increase in average revenue per subscriber primarily in north america and a 1 increase in worldwide subscribers revenue growth from servicemagic was driven primarily by a 37 increase in customer service requests improved monetization of service requests and a 9 increase in the number of service providers in the network

percentage of revenue traffic acquisition costs associated with network revenue generated from integrated paid listings are lower than traffic acquisition costs associated with distribution revenue generated from partners who redirect traffic to the askcom landing page the decrease in traffic acquisition costs from match was due primarily to improved economics from agreements with certain domestic distribution partners partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in cost of sales from emerging businesses primarily due to an increase of 78 million in cost of products sold and 32 million in shipping and handling costs at shoebuy cost of sales from emerging businesses was further impacted by a writeoff of capitalized software including game development costs at instantactioncom increased costs associated with giftscom and costs incurred by various early stage businesses not in the year ago period also offsetting the overall decrease in cost of sales was increased traffic acquisition costs from servicemagic as it continued to focus its spend on driving higher margin home repair and improvement requests however during 2008 servicemagic experienced slowing growth in these high margin requests due in part to this weak economic environment

other income expense 



interest income in 2008 decreased 342 million from 2007 primarily due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 2008 as well as the impact of lower average interest rates due in part to a reallocation of investments during the second half of the year into lower yielding treasury and government agency funds interest expense in 2008 decreased 267 million from 2007 as the amount of outstanding debt decreased year over year due to the extinguishment of 7342 million of the companys 7 senior notes due 2013 the senior notes as described below the remaining outstanding principal of the senior notes at december 31 2008 is 158 million 

equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 decreased 57 million from 2007 primarily due to a 55 million impairment charge to writedown an equity method investment to its fair value the decline in value was determined to be otherthantemporary due to the equity method investees recent operating losses negative operating cash flows and the resulting need for changes to the investees existing business model the resulting valuation of the investee also reflects the assessment of current market conditions and the investees ability to successfully restructure equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates was further impacted by increased losses associated with various company investments including those not in the year ago period partially offset by higher earnings from its investment in jupiter shop channel co ltd jupiter shop a japanese tv shopping company

other expense in 2008 of 2347 million is primarily due to the writedowns of 1667 million and 133 million related to the companys investment in arcandor ag aro and certain other investments respectively as part of the consideration for the sale of hse in june 2007 the company received approximately 55 million shares of aro stock aro shares during 2008 the company considered the value of the aro shares to be otherthantemporarily impaired and wrote the value of the investment down during both the second and fourth quarters at december 31 2008 the companys investment in aro totaled €169 million or 238 million which is valued at €309 per share the stocks closing price on december 30 2008 these losses were determined to be otherthantemporary due to the significant decline in and the companys assessment of the neartomedium term prospects for a recovery of the aro stock price

equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2007 decreased 90 million from 2006 primarily due to a smaller contribution from the companys investment in jupiter shop 

other expense in 2006 of 75 million was primarily due to a loss of 93 million in the amount recognized related to the derivatives created in the expedia spinoff partially offset by a 13 million gain on foreign exchange 

income tax provision 

in 2008 the company recorded an income tax benefit for continuing operations of 377 million despite income from continuing operations the tax benefit is due to a net reduction in deferred tax liabilities caused by the spinoff foreign tax credits generated by the sale of jupiter shop foreign income taxed at lower rates and state tax benefits partially offset by changes in tax reserves nondeductible costs related to the spinoff and an increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to otherthantemporary losses related to certain investments in 2007 the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of 23 million despite a loss from continuing operations the tax provision includes interest on tax contingencies partially offset by benefits from foreign tax credits associated with foreign equity investments tax exempt income federal tax credits for increasing research activities and nontaxable gains on derivatives in 2006 the company recorded a tax benefit for continuing operations of 485 million which represents an effective tax rate of 64 the 2006 tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to foreign tax credits and the release of deferred tax liabilities associated with a foreign equity investment net adjustments related to the reconciliation of provision accruals to tax returns and state and local income taxes partially offset by interest on tax contingencies

as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 3726 million and 2452 million respectively unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 1275 million due principally to an unrecognized current year capital loss on the companys investment in treecom prior to the spinoff partially offset by the effective settlement of certain prior year tax positions with the internal revenue service irs principally relating to the reversal of deductible temporary differences the company recognizes interest and if applicable penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense included in income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2008 is an 84 million expense and a 18 million benefit respectively net of related deferred taxes of 57 million and 09 million respectively for interest on unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company has accrued 497 million and 400 million respectively for the payment of interest there are no material accruals for penalties 

the irs is currently examining the companys tax returns for the years ended december 31 2001 through 2003 the statute of limitations for these years has been extended to december 31 2009 various state local and foreign jurisdictions are currently under examination the most significant of which are florida new york and new york city for various tax years beginning with december 31 2001 these examinations are expected to be completed in late 2009 in early 2009 the irs commenced an audit of the companys tax returns for the years ended december 31 2004 through 2006 the statute of limitations for these years has been extended and this examination is expected to be completed in 2011 the company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by 152 million within twelve months of the current reporting date due to settlements and the reversal of deductible temporary differences which will primarily result in a corresponding increase in net deferred tax liabilities an estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits while potentially significant cannot be made

iacs principles of financial reporting 

iac reports operating income before amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated we believe that investors should have access to and we are obligated to provide the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and nongaap measure which we discuss below 

definition of iacs nongaap measure 

  operating income before amortization is defined as operating income excluding if applicable 1 noncash compensation expense 2 amortization of noncash marketing 3 amortization and impairment of intangibles 4 goodwill impairment 5 pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions and 6 onetime items we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from iacs segments taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of any other noncash expenses operating income before amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iacs statement of operations of certain expenses including noncash compensation noncash marketing and acquisitionrelated accounting iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the nongaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the nongaap measure 

pro forma results 

we will only present operating income before amortization on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature for the periods presented in this report there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 

onetime items 

operating income before amortization is presented before onetime items if applicable these items are truly onetime in nature and nonrecurring infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years in accordance with sec rules for the periods presented in this report there are no onetime items 

noncash expenses that are excluded from iacs nongaap measure 

  noncash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions of restricted stock restricted stock units and stock options these expenses are not paid in cash and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which for restricted stock units and stock options are included on a treasury method basis upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the exercise of certain stock options the awards are settled at the companys discretion on a net basis with the company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds 

  amortization of noncash marketing consists of noncash advertising secured from universal television as part of the transaction pursuant to which vue was created and the subsequent transaction by which iac sold its partnership interests in vue collectively referred to as the nbc universal advertising the nbc universal advertising is available for television advertising on various nbc universal network and cable channels without any cash cost at december 31 2008 there was 159 million of nbc universal advertising credits available for use 

the nbc universal advertising is excluded from operating income before amortization because it is noncash and generally is incremental to the advertising the company otherwise secures as a result of its ordinary costbenefit marketing planning process accordingly the companys aggregate level of advertising and the increased concentration of that advertising on nbc universal network and cable channels does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits which will expire on september 30 2009 if not exhausted before then as a result management believes that treating the nbc universal advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true costbenefit relationship nor does it best reflect the companys longterm level of advertising expenditures nonetheless while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine and especially so with respect to the nbc universal advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration it is likely that the company does derive benefits from it though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above operating income before amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense 

  amortization of intangibles is a noncash expense relating primarily to acquisitions at the time of an acquisition the intangible assets of the acquired company such as technology and supplier contracts are valued and amortized over their estimated lives while it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies we believe that since intangibles represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition they were part of transaction costs 

reconciliation of operating income before amortization 

for a reconciliation of operating income before amortization to operating loss income by business and to net earnings available to common shareholders in total for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iacs accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based upon an evaluation of its expected discounted cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results the determination of discounted cash flows is based upon forecasted operating results that may not occur the annual assessment for 2008 for those iac businesses included within continuing operations identified impairment charges for the connected ventures and iac search  media reporting units as more fully described above in results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that is subject to assessment for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 is 19 billion and 3373 million respectively at december 31 2008 

certain reporting units are currently operating in dynamic industry segments these include iac search  media and instantactioncom if actual operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results the future impairments of goodwill andor other intangible assets could occur to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges relative to future changes in estimated fair value had the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10 as of october 1 2008 the aggregate book value of goodwill would have exceeded fair value by approximately 140 million at iac search  media and 4 million at instantactioncom had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20 as of october 1 2008 the book value of goodwill would have exceeded fair value by approximately 330 million at iac search  media and 8 million at instantactioncom 

recoverability of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of all longlived assets primarily property and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 impairment is considered to have occurred whenever the carrying value of a longlived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows that is expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset the determination of cash flows is based upon assumptions that may not occur the value of longlived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 is 3764 million at december 31 2008 

marketable securities 

the company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 115 the company invests in certain marketable securities which consist primarily of shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us government agencies and municipalities and foreign sovereignties and investment grade corporate securities in addition the company holds approximately 55 million shares of arcandor ag aro shares at december 31 2008 the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity the specificidentification method is used to determine the cost of a security sold or the amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 

the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential otherthantemporary impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and the companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment loss is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as otherthantemporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the companys investment in marketable securities to decline during 2008 the company concluded that the decline in price of the aro shares was otherthantemporarily impaired and wrote the value of the investment down during both the second and fourth quarters for the year ending december 31 2008 the company recorded a 1667 million impairment charge that is included in other expense income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations these losses were determined to be otherthantemporary due to the significant decline in and the companys assessment of the neartomedium term prospects for a recovery of the aro stock price the carrying value of the aro shares is €169 million or 238 million at december 31 2008 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it is assessed that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors including the length of time accounts receivable are past due the companys previous loss history the specific customers ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the customers industry the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible the company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments the amount of these reserves are based in part on historical experience as of december 31 2008 the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is 114 million 

income taxes 

estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 4 and reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization as of december 31 2008 the balance of deferred tax assets net is 1962 million actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the irs as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results effective 

january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fin 48 as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed by the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

stock based compensation 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company estimated the fair value of options issued in 2008 using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions riskfree interest rates of 26 a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 47 based on the expected market price of iac common stock based on historical trends and a weighted average expected life of the options of 44 years there were no stock options granted by the company during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 for stock options issued since 2003 including unvested options assumed in acquisitions the value of the option is measured at the grant date or acquisition date if applicable at fair value and amortized over the remaining vesting term the impact on compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2008 assuming a 1 increase in the riskfree interest rate a 10 increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected life of the outstanding options would be an increase of 09 million 45 million and 27 million respectively the company also issues restricted stock units and performance stock units for restricted stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and amortized ratably as noncash compensation expense over the vesting term for performance stock units issued the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as noncash compensation when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and longterm debt 

investment portfolio 

the company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable securities which consist primarily of money market instruments and shorttointermediateterm debt securities issued by the us government us governmental agencies and municipalities and foreign sovereignties and investment grade corporate issuers the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary if a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment loss is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

based on the companys total debt investment securities as of december 31 2008 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the debt investment securities by 15 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period conversely since almost all of the companys cash balance of approximately 17 billion is invested in variable rate interest earning assets the company would also earn more less interest income due to such an increase decrease in interest rates 

longterm debt 

at december 31 2008 the companys outstanding debt approximated 958 million all of which pays interest at fixed rates if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would respectively decrease or increase the fair value of the fixedrate debt by 99 million such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions including a constant level and rate of fixedrate debt for all maturities and an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

equity price risk 

the company has investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies these investments as of december 31 2008 were considered availableforsale marketable equity securities and are included in longterm investments with the unrealized gains or losses deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet these availableforsale marketable equity securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market during 2008 the company recorded impairments on availableforsale marketable equity securities of 1729 million including 1667 million related to the companys investment in arcandor ag aro as described below it is not customary for the company to make significant investments in equity securities as part of its marketable securities investment strategy 

as part of the consideration for the sale of hse on june 19 2007 iac received from aro approximately 55 million shares of aro stock the aro shares valued at €141 million plus 

additional consideration in the form of a contingent value right cvr the cvr has value of up to €54 million within three years from the date of sale aro shares are listed on the german stock exchange xetra aro and as a result iac is exposed to changes in aros stock price the ultimate value of the cvr is dependent in part upon the average closing value of the aro shares for the 90 days preceding june 19 2010 the average value to the extent that the average value is equal to or less than €141 million iac will receive a cash payment equal to €54 million to the extent that the average value is equal to or greater than €195 million iac will receive no additional consideration to the extent that the average value is between €141 million and €195 million iac will receive a pro rata portion of the €54 million if the closing value of an aro share equals or exceeds €3568 per share for at least 30 consecutive trading days during the three year period from june 20 2007 through june 19 2010 the cvr expires without any payment being made the cvr is accounted for as a derivative asset and maintained at fair value each reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized in current earnings as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations each period during the year ended december 31 2008 the change in the fair value of the cvr resulted in a gain of 58 million the aro stock is an availableforsale marketable equity security that is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 115 during 2008 the company concluded that the decline in the price of the aro shares was otherthantemporarily impaired and wrote the value of the investment down during both the second and fourth quarters for the year ending december 31 2008 the company recorded a 1667 million impairment charge that is included in other expense income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations these losses were determined to be otherthantemporary due to the significant decline in and the companys assessment of the neartomedium term prospects for a recovery of the aro stock price the carrying value of the aro shares is €169 million or 238 million at december 31 2008 

following the expedia spinoff a derivative liability was created due to iacs obligation to deliver shares of both iac common stock and expedia common stock to the holders upon conversion of the ask zero coupon convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes a derivative asset was also created due to expedias contractual obligation to deliver shares of expedia common stock to iac upon conversion by the holders of the convertible notes both the derivative liability and derivative asset was maintained at fair value each reporting period and the changes in fair values which were based upon changes in both iac common stock and expedia common stock were recognized in current earnings as a component of other income expense during the second quarter of 2008 the convertible notes were fully converted and the related derivatives expired the net fair value adjustments recognized in current earnings during the year ended december 31 2008 were gains of 05 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the companys primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling however the exposure is mitigated since the company has generally reinvested profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses as a percentage of total iac revenue which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations international operations represented approximately 19 in 2008 and 15 in both 2007 and 2006 the statements of operations of the companys international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues and operating income similarly the companys revenue and operating income will increase for our international operations if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 

as the company increases its operations in international markets it becomes increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings in 2008 2007 and 2006 as currency exchange rates change translation of the income statements of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged foreign currency translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally however the company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency translation risks the companys objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings cash flows and financial position

item 1  business


we are engaged in research and development of metal fatigue detection
measurement and monitoring technologies as such we are developing a
comprehensive system of monitoring devices for metal fatigue measurement we are
a development stage company doing business as tensiodyne scientific corporation

our efforts are dedicated to developing devices and systems that indicate the
true fatigue status of a metal component we have developed two products with a
third product now under development the first is a small extremely simple
device that continuously integrates the effect of fatigue loading in a
structural member called a fatigue fuse the second an instrument that detects
very small cracks and is intended to determine crack growth rates is the
electrochemical fatigue sensor it has demonstrated that it can detect cracks
in the laboratory as small as 10 microns 00004 inches which is smaller than




                                        2
page






any other practical technologies as acknowledged by the united states air force
and confirmed by rockwell scientific corporation we believe that nothing
comparable to this instrument currently exists in materials technology

both devices are pioneering technology in the fatigue field that we believe
provide cuttingedge solutions in materials technology both products are
protected by patents we hold the patents on the fatigue fuse and license the
technology on the electrochemical fatigue sensor see our patent protections


another product currently under development is a videoscope which comprises a
fiber optic bundle and light source together with a working channel through
which certain nondestructive test sensors such as ultrasound andor eddy
current devices can be passed to inspect visually or manually inaccessible
regions of structures such as the interior of jet turbine engines

the fiber optic bundle provides very clear video resolution utilizing a video
camera integrated in the videoscope handle images are then displayed on a
monitor and can be recorded the videoscope is derived from similar devices in
wide use in medicine


its uniqueness is its small diameter and its capability for applying multiple
sensors such as ultrasound andor eddy current developed to inspect internal
components of fully assembled jet turbine engines using the existing inspection
holes in assembled engine outer surfaces it can be used to access remote areas
of bridges and other structures to monitor fatigue and other cracks permitting
good visual access to otherwise inaccessible areas

we were formed as a delaware corporation on march 4 1997 it is the successor
to the business of material technology inc a delaware corporation also doing
business as tensiodyne scientific inc material technology inc was the
successor to the business of tensiodyne corporation that began developing the
fatigue fuse in 1983 our two predecessors tensiodyne corporation and material
technology inc were engaged in developing and testing the fatigue fuse and
beginning in 1993 developing the electrochemical fatigue sensor


on january 22 2003 we formed matech international inc a wholly owned
subsidiary on march 13 2003 we formed another wholly owned subsidiary matech
aerospace incwe formed matech international for the purpose of granting it a
comprehensive agreement that licenses all manufacturing and marketing rights to
our products and technologies in all commercial markets outside of the untied
states in exchange for a royalty equal to 7  of gross sales generated by the
subsidiary we formed matech areospace inc for the purpose of granting it the
same comprehensive license as we granted to international only aerospace will be
granted manufacturing and marketing rights within the united states in exchange
for a7 royalty on all gross sales generated by it


the fatigue fuse


the fatigue fuse is designed to be affixed to a structure to give warnings as
preselected portions of the fatigue life have been used up ie how far to
failure the structure has progressed it warns against a condition of
widespread generalized cracking due to fatigue

the fatigue fuse is a thin piece of metal similar to the material being
monitored it consists of a series of parallel metal strips connected to a
common base much as fingers are attached to a hand each finger has a
different geometric pattern called notches defining its boundaries each
finger incorporates a designspecific notch near the base by applying the laws
of physics to determine the geometric contour of each notch the fatigue life of
each finger is finite and predictable when the fatigue life of a finger fuse
is reached the fuse breaks

by implementing different geometry for each finger in the array different
increments of fatigue life are observable typically notches will be designed
to facilitate observing increments of fatigue life of 10 to 20 by




                                        3
page






mechanically attaching or bonding these devices to different areas of the
structural member of concern the fuse undergoes the same fatigue history
strain cycles as the structural member therefore breakage of a fuse
indicates that an increment of fatigue life has been reached for the structural
member the notch and the size and shape of the notch concentrate energy on each
finger the fuse is intimately attached to the structural member of interest
therefore the fuse experiences the same load and wear history as the member
methods are available for remote indication of fuse fracturing

we believe that the fatigue fuse will be of value in monitoring aircraft ships
bridges conveyor systems mining equipment cranes etc no special training
will be needed to qualify individuals to report any broken segments of the
fatigue fuse to the appropriate engineering authority for necessary action the
success of the device is contingent upon our successful development and
marketing of the fatigue fuse and no assurance can be given that we will be
able to overcome the obstacles relating to introducing a new product to the
market to determine its ability to produce and market the fatigue fuse we need
substantial additional capital and no assurance can be given that needed capital
will be available

in a new structure we generally assume there is no fatigue and can thus design
the fatigue fuse for 100 of its life potential but in an existing structure
one that has experienced loading and wear we must determine the fatigue status
of that structural member so we can design the fatigue fuse to monitor the
remaining fatigue life potential

the electrochemical fatigue sensor efs


the efs is a device that employs the principle of electrochemicalmechanical
interaction to find cracks it is an instrument that detects very small cracks
and is intended to determine crack growth rates the electrochemical fatigue
sensor has demonstrated in the laboratory that it can detect cracks as small as
10 microns 00004 inches which is smaller than any other practical
technologies as acknowledged by the united states air force and rockwell
scientific corporation we believe that nothing comparable to this instrument
currently exists in materials technology

the efs functions by treating the location of interest the target associated
with the structural member as an electrode of an electrochemical cell by
imposing a constant voltageequivalent circuit as the control mechanism for the
electrochemical reaction at the target surface  current flows as a function of
stress action the efs is always a dynamic process therefore stress action is
required eg to measure a bridge structural member it is necessary that cyclic
loads be imposed as normal traffic on the bridge would do the results are a
specific set of current waveforms and amplitudes that is expected to
characterize and report fatigue damage ie fatigue cracks


the videoscope


stress points are very often located in difficulttogetat places for humans
therefore it has become desirable to miniaturize the process and develop a
means for delivery to inaccessible areas the videoscope comprises a fiber optic
bundle and light source together with a working channel through which certain
nondestructive test sensors such as ultrasound andor eddy current devices can




                                        4

be passed to inspect visually or manually inaccessible regions of structures
the device as presently implemented has a maximum diameter of 6 mm 0236
inches and length of 15m 60 inches contained within this diameter is a
working channel of 28 mm 011 inches diameter through which proprietary eddy
current or ultrasonic sensors may be passed and used to examine areas of
interest

the videoscopes uniqueness is its small diameter and its capability for
applying multiple nondestructive test sensors developed to inspect internal
components of fully assembled jet turbine engines using the existing inspection
holes in assembled engine outer surfaces it can be used to access remote areas
of bridges and other structures to monitor fatigue and other cracks permitting
good visual access to otherwise inaccessible areas


during the quarter ended december 31 2002 we announced preliminary discussions
to launch a joint venture with optim incorporated of sturbridge massachusetts
which is intended to commercially introduce a new borescope product known as the
optispec flaw detection system this new product combines remote visual
inspection with ultrasonic and eddy current nondestructive testing methods
which rapidly and accurately determine if the observed indication is in fact a
flaw that merits evaluation or repair optim incorporated designs
manufactures markets and sells flexible endoscopy products for both the medical
and industrial markets our discussions with optim incorporated have resulted
in a preliminary arrangement whereby we may enter into a formal supply and
license agreement with optim enabling us to access technology developed by optim
for our planned marketing and distribution of the optispec flaw detection
system our early planning for our borescope product includes our recent
formation of a whollyowned subsidiary matech aerospace inc from which we
intend to further develop market and distribute our borescope products we are
uncertain at this juncture when a formal supply and license agreement will be
entered into with optim and if entered into the extent to which revenues may be
generated from the commercial development of the optispec flaw detection system
and when product sales will begin no assurances can be given by us at this time
that we will be in a position to develop and market the optispec flaw detection
system

development of our technologies


status of the fatigue fuse

the development and application sequence for the fatigue fuse and efs is a
basic research b exploratory development c advanced development d
prototype evaluation e application demonstration and f commercial sales
and service the fatigue fuse came first the inventor professor maurice brull
conducted the basic research at the university of pennsylvania we conducted the
advanced development including variations of the adhesive bonding process and
fabricating a laboratorygrade remote recorder for finger separation events that
constitute proper functioning of the fatigue fuse the next step prototype
evaluation that encompasses empirical tailoring of fuse parameters to fit the
actual spectrum loading expected in specific applications needs to be done the
tests associated with further development of the fatigue fuse include fullscale
structural tests with attached fuses a prototype of the fatigue fuse has been
designed fabricated and successfully demonstrated the next tasks will be to




                                        5
page






prepare an analysis for more efficient selection of fuse parameters and to
conduct a comprehensive test program to prove the ability of the fatigue fuse to
accurately indicate fatigue damage when subjected to realistically large
variations in measuring stresses and strains in fatiguing metal the final tasks
prior to marketing will be an even larger group of demonstration tests

the fatigue fuse is at its final stages of testing and development to begin
marketing the fuse will take from six to 12 months and cost approximately
600000 including technical and beta testing and final development if
testing development and marketing are successful we estimate we should begin
receiving revenue from the sale of the fatigue fuse within a year of receiving
the 600000 however we cannot estimate the amount of revenue that may be
realized from sales of the fuse if any

to date certain organizations have included our fatigue fuse in test programs
we have already completed the tests for welded steel civil bridge members
conducted at the university of rhode island in 1996 westland helicopter a
british firm tested the fatigue fuse on helicopters that test was successful
with the legs of the fuses failing in sequence as predicted

the fatigue fuse has been at this stage for the past several years as the
company has not had the necessary financial resources to finalize its
development and commence marketing

status of the efs


the existence and size of very small cracks can be determined by efs and in
this regard it appears superior in resolution to other current nondestructive
testing techniques it has succeeded in regularly detecting cracks as small as
40 microns in a titanium alloy in a laboratory environment as verified by a
scanning electronic microscope and has proven to be capable of detecting cracks
down to 10 microns as acknowledged by the materials laboratory at wright
patterson air force and confirmed by evaluations at rockwell scientific
corporation this is much smaller than the capability of any other practical
nondestructive testing method for structural components there is also a vast
body of testing supporting successful use of this technology with selected
aluminum alloys however additional testing is required to verify efs crack
detection capabilities under various industrial environments which are more
representative of actual structures in the field like a highway bridge or
aircraft fuselage

joint technology venture with integrated technologies inc


by agreement dated january 1 2003 a new co joint venture subsidiary we formed
integrated technologies inc a delaware corporation and austin tech llc a
texas limited liability company entered into a license agreement we own 51 of
the outstanding capital stock of integrated technologies inc and austin tech
llc owns the remaining 49 of the outstanding capital stock we jointly formed
integrated technologies inc for the purpose of jointly developing marketing
and licensing a new brand of remote transmittal monitoring products from our
combined technologies integrated technologies inc as the licensee of the
technologies owned by austin tech llc has also entered into a form of license
agreement directly with us for the purpose of having access to our technologies
for joint development purposes the license agreements granted to integrated

technologies inc by austin tech llc and by us expire on january 1 2005
unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the agreements the terms of
the licenses granted to integrated technologies inc are exclusive royalty
free and are geographically limited to certain territories described in the
license agreements which include the united states canada middle eastern
countries several northern european countries mexico and brazil

government contract funding


historically we have generated contract revenue by seeking research and
development contracts awarded by agencies of the united states government such
as the us air force in developing our contract revenue we have enlisted the
assistance of research and development partners that have used us as
subcontractors in the research and development effort in august 1996 we
executed an agreement entitled teaming agreement with the southwest research
institute and the university of pennsylvania for coordinated research and
development efforts

we have also entered into similar relationships with universal technology
corporation which is a government contractor that acts as a passthrough or
monitor of our contracts universal technology corporation has acted as the
prime contractor with the air force and we function as a first tier
subcontractor other than our association with these groups as research and
development partners we have no other affiliation our contract revenue from
all sources of research and development agreements concluded in the third
quarter of fiscal year 2002 and we do not have any additional contract revenue
anticipated during the next 12 months

on february 25 1997 the southwest research institute was awarded from the
united states air force a 2500000 phase one contract to determine the
feasibility of the efs to improve the us air force capability to perform
durability assessments of military aircraft including air frames and engines
through the application of the efs to specific military aircraft alloys our
share of this award was approximately 550000 on june 18 1998 universal
technology corporation one of our contracting partners was awarded a second
contract in the amount of 2061642 to determine the applicability of the efs
to improve the u s air force capability to perform durability assessments of
military aircraft including both air frames and engines through the application
of the efs to specific military aircraft alloys our share of this award was
approximately 538000 on february 5 1999 a third contract in the amount of
2000000 was awarded to universal technology corporation to continue and
expand the efforts for turbine engines our directly subcontracted share was
approximately 382000 a fourth contract was awarded to universal technology
corporation on november 3 2000 in the amount of approximately 2000000 to
continue the borescope and efs technologies as well as alternate means of
fatigue sensing this fourth contract has been fully performed our directly
subcontracted share is approximately 700000 accordingly over the last four
years we have been awarded approximately 8500000 in research and develop
services covering the efs the results of this research are encouraging and
provide a basis for us and our contract partners to obtain additional funding
however we cannot provide any assurance that additional contract revenue will
be generated by us or received in the future

commercial markets for our products and technologies


no commercial application of our products has been arranged to date but the
technology has matured to a point where we believe it can be applied to certain
markets our technology is applicable to many market sectors such as bridges and
aerospace as well as ships cranes power plants nuclear facilities chemical
plants mining equipment piping systems and heavy iron we anticipate that our
planned supply and licensing arrangement with optim incorporated for the
commercial sale and distribution of the optispec flaw detection system will
begin to generate material product sales from the borescope in the third
quarter of the current fiscal year we cannot provide assurances that the
marketing and distribution of the optispec flaw detection system will in fact
occur at any specific time in the future due to the possibility that we may not
enter into a formal agreements with optim incorporated or if we do we may
experience delays or difficulties in the initial marketing sales and
distribution of the product nor can we provide assurances that our results of
operations and our financial condition will materially improve from the planned
commercial distribution of the optispec flaw detection system

application of our technologies for bridges


our efs and fatigue fuse products primarily address the detection of fatigue in
structures such as bridges in the united states alone there are more than
610000 bridges of which over 260000 are rated by the federal highway
administration as requiring major repair rehabilitation or replacement our
efs and fatigue fuse products can be effectively used as fatigue detection
devices for all metal bridges located within the united states our detection
devices also address maintenance problems associated with bridge structures

although there are normal business imperatives the bridge market is essentially
macroeconomically and government policy driven in our opinion only technology
can provide the solution the need for increased spending accelerates
significantly each year as infrastructure ages the federal government has
mandated bridge repair and detection through the passage of the intermodal
surface transportation and efficiency act in 1991 and again recently in the 200
billion 1998 transportation equity act we do not currently have contracts in
place to install our fatigue detection products on bridge structures within the
united states

our patent protections


we are the assignee of four patents originally issued to tensiodyne corporation
the first was issued on may 27 1986 and expires on may 27 2003 it is titled
device for monitoring fatigue life and bears united states patent office
numbers 4590804 the second patent titled method of making a device for
monitoring fatigue life was issued on february 3 1987 and expires february 3

2010 united states patent number 5237875 the fourth patent titled device
for monitoring the fatigue life of a structural member and a method of making
same was issued on june 14 1994 and expires on june 14 2011 united states
patent number 5319982 in addition we own a fifth patent titled device for
monitoring the fatigue life of a structural member and a method of making same

which was issued june 20 1995 united states patent number 5425274 and
expires june 20 2012

our patents are encumbered


the patents described in the preceding section are pledged as collateral to
secure the repayment of loans extended to us or indebtedness that we currently
owe on august 30 1986 we entered into a funding agreement with the advanced
technology center whereby atc paid 45000 to us for the purchase of a royalty
of 3 of future gross sales and 6 of sublicensing revenue the royalty is
limited to the 45000 plus an 11 annual rate of return at december 31 2001
and 2002 the future royalty commitment was limited to 227149 and 252136
respectively the payment of future royalties is secured by equipment we use in
the development of technology as specified in the funding agreement however no
lien against our equipment or our patents in favor of atc vests until we
generate royalties from product sales

on may 4 1987 we entered into a funding agreement with atc whereby atc
provided 63775 to us for the purchase of a royalty of 3 of future gross sales
and 6 of sublicensing revenue the agreement was amended august 28 1987 and
as amended the royalty cannot exceed the lesser of 1 the amount of the
advance plus a 26 annual rate of return or 2 total royalties earned for a
term of 17 years as with our first agreement with atc no lien or encumbrance
against our assets including our patents vests in favor of atc until we
generate royalties from product sales if we were to default on these payments
to atc our obligations relating to these agreements then become secured by our
patents products and accounts receivable at december 31 2001 and 2002 the
total future royalty commitments including the accumulated 26 annual rate of
return were limited to approximately 1725234 and 2173795 respectively

on may 27 1994 we borrowed 25000 from sherman baker one of our
shareholders we gave mr sherman a promissory note due may 31 2002 and we
pledged our patents as collateral to secure the repayment of this note as of
the date of this prospectus there is a first priority security interest in our
patents as collateral for the repayment of the amounts we owe to mr baker as
additional consideration for this loan we granted to mr baker a 1 royalty
interest in the fatigue fuse and a 05 royalty interest in the electrochemical
fatigue sensor we are in default of the repayment terms of the note held by mr
baker and at march 31 2003 we owe mr baker approximately 60000 in
principal and accrued interest mr baker has not taken any action to foreclose
his interest in the collateral and we are in discussions with mr baker with
the expectation that we will cure any default in the note he holds and avoid any
foreclosure of his security interest held in our patents we believe that
although we have not yet cured our defaults on the loans to mr baker our
current communications with him suggest that mr baker does not have the present
intention of foreclosing on the patents as collateral or the pursuit of legal
action against us to collect the balance due under our note

distribution of our products


subject to available financing we intend to exhibit the fatigue fuse and the
electrochemical fatigue sensor at various aerospace trade shows and intend to
also market our products directly to end users including aircraft manufacturing




                                        9
page






and aircraft maintenance companies crane manufactures and operators certain
state regulatory agencies charged with overseeing bridge maintenance companies
engaged in manufacturing and maintaining large ships and tankers and the
military although we intend to undertake marketing dependent on the
availability of funds within and without the united states no assurance can be
given that any such marketing activities will be implemented

competition


other technologies exist which measure and indicate fatigue damage single
cracks larger than a minimum size can be found by nondestructive inspection
methods such as dye penetrate radiography eddy current acoustic emission and
ultrasonics tracking of load and strain history to subsequently estimate
fatigue damage by computer processing is possible with recording instruments
such as strain gauges and counting accelerometers these methods have been used
for 40 years and also offer the advantage of having been accepted in the market
whereas our products remain largely unproven companies marketing these
alternate technologies include magnaflux corporation krautkermerbranson
duneganendevco and micro measurements these companies have more substantial
assets greater experience and more resources than ours including but not
limited to established distribution channels and an established customer base
the familiarity and loyalty to these technologies may be difficult to dislodge
because we are still in the development stage we are unable to predict whether
our technologies will be successfully developed and commercially attractive in
potential markets

employees


the company has four employees robert m bernstein president and chief
executive officer a secretary and two part time engineers in addition the
company retains consultants for specialized work










item 2  properties


the company leases an office at 11661 san vicente blvd suite 707 los angeles
california 90049 the space consists of 830 square feet and will be adequate
for the companys current and foreseeable needs the total rent is payable at
2348 per month through june 30 2003 the company has an option to extend the

critical accounting issues


the discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of
operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the
company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets liabilities revenues and expenses in consultation with its board of
directors the company has identified two accounting policies that it believes
are key to an understanding of its financial statements these are important
accounting policies that require managements most difficult subjective
judgments

the first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition income from
the companys subcontracts with the air force is recognized at the time services
are rendered and billed for

the second critical accounting policy relates to research and development
expense costs incurred in the development of the companys fatigue fuse and
sensor are expensed as incurred

the third critical accounting policy relates to the valuation of nonmonetary
consideration issued for services rendered the company values all services
rendered in exchange for its common stock at the quoted price of the shares
issued at date of issuance all other services provided in exchange for other
nonmonetary consideration is valued at either the fair value of the services
received or the fair value of the consideration relinquished whichever is more
readably determinable

board of directors
material technologies inc
los angeles california

i have audited the accompanying balance sheets of material technologies inc
a development stage company as of december 31 2001 and 2002 and the related
statements of operations stockholders equity deficit and cash flows for
the years ended december 31 2000 2001 2002 and for the period from the
companys inception october 21 1983 through december 31 2002 these
financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management my
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
my audits

i conducted my audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the united states these standards require that i plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation i believe that my audits provide a reasonable basis for my
opinion

in my opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all
material respects the financial position of material technologies inc as of
december 31 2001 and 2002 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years ended december 31 2000 2001 2002 and for the period from
the companys inception october 21 1983 through december 31 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
company will continue as a going concern as discuss in note 15 to the financial
statements the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a
net capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the its ability to
continue as a going concern managements plans regarding those matters also are
also described in note 15 the financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

          on october 10 2001 the company  entered into an arrangement  whereby
          allied   boston  group  will  provide  the  company  with  a  straight
          documentary  credit a letter of credit  for  12500000  under the
          terms of the commitment  the company will pledge sufficient shares of
          its common  stock to equal 125 of the  straight  documentary  credit
          under the initial terms  the shares were valued at 27 per share if
          the companys stock price goes lower  then additional  shares will be
          pledged  if the stock  price goes to a 100 per share  then  allied
          boston is required to liquidate a  sufficient  number of shares to pay
          off the amount funded through this straight  documentary credit after
          the amount is paid off allied boston will retain 25 million shares of
          the companys  common stock  any remaining shares will be returned to
          the company

          upon funding through the straight  documentary  credit the company is
          required to pay a success fee to allied  boston in the amount of 8 of
          the amount  funded of which 50 will be paid in cash and the remainder
          of the fee will be paid through the issuance of the  companys  common
          stock to be valued at market value at the time of issuance as long as

          the documentary  credit is in force  allied boston will have 2 voting
          seats on the companys board all outofpocket expenses pertaining to
          the issuance of the instrument will be borne by the company

          in october 2001  the company issued  60000000  shares of its common
          stock as  collateral  to allied  boston  pursuant  to the terms of the
          agreement  and in january 2002 the company issued  40000000 shares
          as additional collateral as indicated the selling of these shares are
          contingent upon the occurrence of future events  further this shares
          can not be voted on by allied boston until such time as the credit has
          been funded  therefore as these shares can not be sold or voted  the
          company   treats  the  shares  issued   held  in  reserve   and  not
          outstanding

          as of the balance sheet date the credit has not been funded  however
          the company is in discussions with funding sources

     j   litigation

          in july 2002 the company  settled its pending  lawsuit with mr beck
          under the terms of the settlement  mr beck received 1000000 shares
          of the company common stock  the shares to be issued are nondilutive
          for a period of five years  the company  valued the shares issued to
          mr  beck at  40000  the  quoted  price  of the  shares  on date of
          issuance was charged to operations accordingly

          in addition  pursuant to the agreement  that the company had with the
          attorneys  who  represented  it in this matter  a  contingent  fee of
          1481895  became due them upon the settlement of the case this fee
          however  is payable  out of the  companys  earnings  derived  before
          interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebida limited each
          year to 25 of ebida  unpaid  amounts  owed  towards  the fee  accrue
          interest at a rate of 6 per annum until paid in full  the balance of
          this  obligation  at december 31 2002  including  accrued  interest is
          1519166 interest charged to operations for 2002 totaled 37271

          as the amounts due the  attorneys  are paid out of profits and amounts
          paid  annually are limited as indicated  management  does not believe
          that the  liability  to the  attorneys  will  have any  impact  on the
          companys ability to continue operating however payments made to the
          attorneys will  obviously  have a impact on the companys  future cash
          flow  that  could  limit  the  amounts  spent on  future  projects  or
          expansion

usa is controlled by mr diller and in his absence will be controlled by liberty media corporation subject to the terms of an amended and restated stockholders agreement dated as of december 16 2001 among universal liberty mr diller and vivendi mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of usas stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of usa common stock of 25 of the members of usas board of directors rounded up to the nearest whole number and matters as to which a separate class vote of the holders of usa common stock or usa preferred stock is required under delaware law 

in addition under an amended and restated governance agreement dated as of december 16 2001 among usa vivendi universal liberty and mr diller each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that usas ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 41 over a continuous 12month period usa cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when usa is highly leveraged in which case usa would not be able to engage in such transaction or take such actions 

upon mr dillers permanent departure from usa liberty generally would be able to control usa through its ownership of shares of usa class b common stock 

usas success depends on maintaining the integrity of its systems and infrastructure a fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information such as credit card numbers or other personal information over public networks usas current security measures may not be adequate and if any compromise of usas security were to occur it could have a detrimental effect on usas reputation and adversely affect its ability to attract customers as usas operations continue to grow in both size and scope usa will need to improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure this may require usa to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 

usa relies on its own affiliates and thirdparty computer systems and service providers to facilitate and process a portion of its transactions any interruptions outages or delays in these services or a deterioration in their performance could impair usas ability to process transactions for its customers and the quality of service usa can offer to them it is unlikely that usa could make up for the level of orders lost in these circumstances by increased phone orders 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems may affect our business usas subsidiaries rely on computer and other systems in order to provide their services to customers at times usa subsidiaries may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems unavailable or prevent the subsidiaries from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties to prevent system interruptions usa and its subsidiaries continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade systems and network infrastructure to accommodate both increased traffic on websites and increased sales volume computer and communications systems of usa and its subsidiaries could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent usa subsidiaries from providing services to third parties while usa and its subsidiaries do have backup systems for certain aspects of operations the systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition usa and its subsidiaries may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could damage the reputation of usa and its subsidiaries and be expensive to remedy 

declines or disruptions in the industries in which usa operates such as those caused by terrorism war or general economic downturns could harm usas businesses in addition a negative financial performance of companies in which usa is the majority stockholder can have a negative affect on usas stock price usas businesses in general are sensitive to trends or events that are outside of usas control for example adverse trends or events such as general economic downturns decreases in consumer spending work stoppages and political instability may reduce the popularity and frequency of the events to which usa sells tickets reduce travel and may affect call center and other operations in areas where these trends or events occur the occurrence of any of these adverse trends or events could significantly impact usas businesses results of operations or financial condition in addition 

usas stock price may be adversely affected by negative reports of the results of operations or declines in the stock price of companies in which usa is a major stockholder regardless of the affect these negative reports or stock price declines may have on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

travel is highly sensitive to traveler safety concerns and thus declines after acts of terrorism impact the perceived safety of travelers could significantly impact usas businesses results of operations or financial condition in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 for example the travel industry experienced a protracted decrease in demand for air travel due to fears regarding additional acts of terrorism and increased costs and reduced operations by airlines due in part to new security directives adopted by the federal aviation administration usa cannot predict the future scope and effects of these changes which could significantly impact usas longterm results of operations or financial condition 

usa may experience operational and financial risks in connection with its acquisitions in addition some of the businesses usa acquires may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value usas future growth may be a function in part of acquisitions to the extent that usa grows through acquisitions it will face the operational and financial risks commonly encountered with that type of a strategy usa would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting its ongoing business dissipating its limited management resources and impairing its relationships with employees and customers of acquired businesses as a result of changes in ownership and management some of usas acquisitions may not be successful and their performances may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

changing laws and regulations and legal uncertainties regarding the internet may impair usas growth and harm its businesses a number of proposed laws and regulations regarding the internet including with respect to consumer privacy have been proposed or considered that could impact usas businesses usa cannot predict whether any of these types of laws or regulations will be enacted or amended and what effect if any such laws or regulations would have on its businesses financial condition or results of operations in addition the application of various sales use and other tax provisions under state and local law to usas historical and new products and services sold via the internet television and telephone is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities usa believes it is compliant with these tax provisions but there can be no assurances that taxing authorities will not take a contrary position or that such positions will not have a material adverse effect on usas businesses financial condition and results of operations for additional information see regulation below

electronic retailing 

hsnus 

hsn sells a variety of consumer goods and services by means of live customerinteractive electronic retail sales programs that are transmitted via satellite to cable television systems direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affiliated broadcast television stations and satellite dish receivers hsn operates two retail sales programs in the united states each 24 hours a day seven days a week hsn and americas store 

hsns retail sales and programming are intended to promote sales and customer loyalty through a combination of product quality price and value coupled with product information and entertainment hsn and americas store programs are divided into segments that are televised with a host who presents the merchandise sometimes with the assistance of a guest representing the product vendor and conveys information relating to the product viewers purchase products by calling a tollfree telephone number or via hsncom 

as of december 31 2002 hsn was available in approximately 785 million unduplicated households including approximately 766 million cable and dbs households these numbers include the reduction in household carriage as shown in the table below as of january 14 2002 as a result of the last of the usa stations sold to univision converting from hsn programming to univision programming see broadcast television distribution below 

the following table highlights the changes in the estimated unduplicated television household reach of hsn by category of access for the year ended december 31 2001 through january 14 2002 and for the year ended december 31 2002 

 1 households capable of receiving both broadcast and cable transmissions are included under cable and therefore are excluded from broadcast to present unduplicated household reach 2 cable households included 171 million and 147 million direct broadcast satellite households at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively and therefore are excluded from other 3 see broadcast television distribution below for a discussion of the disaffiliation of certain stations from hsn in 2002 and 2003 4 households lost as a result of the conversion of the majority owned stations sold to univision by usa from hsn programming to univision programming see broadcast television distribution below according to industry sources as of december 31 2002 there were 1066 million homes in the united states with a television set of those there were 744 million basic cable television subscribers 171 million dbs subscribers and 601568 homes with satellite dish receivers 

as of december 31 2002 americas store reached approximately 48 million cable television households of which approximately 15 million were distributed on a digital tier of the total cable television households receiving americas store 46 million also receive hsn 

cable television distribution hsn has entered into affiliation agreements with cable system operators to carry hsn andor americas store these agreements are multiyear arrangements and obligate the cable operator to assist with the promotional efforts of hsn by carrying commercials promoting hsn and americas store and by distributing hsns marketing materials to the cable operators subscribers all cable operators receive significant compensation for carriage including a commission based on a percentage of the net merchandise sales within the cable operators franchise area and generally additional compensation consisting of the purchase of advertising availabilities from cable operators on other programming networks commission guarantees for the operator andor upfront payments to the operator in return for commitments to deliver a minimum number of hsn subscribers for a certain number of years from time to time a cable network operated by hsn will be distributed on one or more cable systems without a distribution agreement in effect while the parties negotiate a new agreement a process that may be protracted while the cessation of carriage by a major cable operator would have a negative impact on the financial results of hsn the company has successfully managed the distribution agreement process in the past and believes it will continue to do so for additional information see regulation—cable ownership section below 

broadcast television distribution hsn has entered into affiliation agreements with television stations to carry hsn and americas store programs as of december 31 2002 hsn had affiliation agreements with 1 fulltime fullpower television station 22 parttime fullpower television stations and 84 lowpower television stations for the carriage of hsn and americas store programs the affiliation agreements have terms ranging from several weeks to several years all television station affiliates receive an hourly or monthly fixed rate for airing hsn and americas store programs a fullpower television station is generally carried by cable operators within the stations coverage area for more information see regulation—mustcarry rights lowpower stations are rarely carried by cable systems and may be displaced by broadcast digital television transmissions 

in addition to these affiliation agreements with independently owned television stations usa formerly carried hsn on a fulltime basis on 10 of its 13 owned and operated fullpower television stations and 27 lowpower television stations on december 7 2000 usa entered into an agreement to transfer its 13 fullpower television stations and its minority interest in 4 other fullpower television stations three of which carried hsn to univision in a series of closings in 2001 with the final payment made on january 14 2002 the last of the usa stations converted to univision programming hsn therefore relies on the contractual obligations with cable operators to receive hsn programming via the direct satellite feed as described below in 2001 usa also sold the 27 lowpower television stations to ventana television inc subject to longterm affiliation agreements with hsn with usa retaining a 25 interest in the lowpower television stations 

as noted in the companys previous filings the majority of the stations sold to univision are located in the largest markets in the country and aired hsn on a 24hour basis as of january 2002 hsn switched its distribution in these markets directly to cable carriage as a result hsn initially lost approximately 12 million broadcast homes and accordingly hsns operating results were affected based on current estimates hsn believes that lost sales translated on a pro forma basis for 2001 were 1374 million and estimated lost adjusted ebitda was 274 million these amounts are higher than original estimates in addition in order to effectively transfer hsns distribution to cable in 2002 hsn incurred charges of approximately 317 million in the form of payments to cable operators and related marketing expenses including 22 million of redemptions of coupons offered to customers impacted by disengagement hsn expects that total disengagement expenses will be approximately 100 million which payment will offset hsns pretax proceeds from the univision transaction which totaled 11 billion these disengagement costs are excluded from adjusted ebitda 

direct broadcast satellite distribution hsn has entered into affiliation agreements with the two largest direct broadcast satellite operators to carry hsn the agreements are multiyear arrangements and obligate the direct broadcast satellite operator to deliver a minimum number of hsn subscribers throughout the term in consideration for a distribution payment and a commission based on net merchandise sales to such subscribers the direct broadcast satellite operators are also obligated to assist with the promotional efforts of hsn by carrying commercials promoting hsn and by distributing hsns marketing materials to its subscribers 

satellite transmission uplink hsn produces its programming in its studios located in st petersburg florida hsn and americas store programs are distributed to cable television systems broadcast television stations direct broadcast satellite andor satellite antenna owners by means of hsns satellite uplink facilities to satellite transponders leased by hsn 

hsn has lease agreements securing fulltime use of two transponders on two domestic communications satellites the terms of two of the satellite transponder leases utilized by hsn are for the life of the satellites which are projected through november of 2004 for the satellite presently carrying hsn and through may of 2005 for the satellite carrying americas store 

hsn has entered into a longterm satellite transponder lease to provide for continued carriage of hsn on a replacement satellite in the event of a failure of the satellite currently carrying hsn programming although hsn believes it is taking every reasonable measure to ensure its continued satellite transmission capability there can be no assurance that termination or interruption of satellite transmissions will not occur such a termination or interruption of service by one or both of these satellites could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of usa 

the fcc grants licenses to construct and operate satellite uplink facilities that transmit signals to satellites these licenses are generally issued without a hearing if suitable frequencies are available hsn has been granted one license for operation of cband satellite transmission facilities and one license for operation of kuband satellite transmission facilities on a permanent basis in clearwater and st petersburg florida 

hsncom hsn operates hsncom as a transactional ecommerce site hsncom serves as an alternative store front that allows consumers to shop for merchandise from hsns inventory rather than just viewing the current product offering on hsns television programming it also offers additional inventory that is not available on hsns television programming 

hsncom offers specialized product shopping areas based on product categories key brands guest personalities and other areas of interest it also offers editorial and informational content such as photographs and information about hsn show hosts and guest personalities tips for consumers on improving their lives customer service and television programming information in addition hsncom offers special features such as streaming video of hsns television programming live chats with celebrity guests and special interactive features such as personalized modeling for fashions 

hsncom was profitable on an operating basis within three months of its launch in 1999 and has grown to become an important selling platform for hsn generating approximately 116 of total us sales in 2002

regulation 

usa and its subsidiaries market a broad range of goods and services through a number of different distribution channels and as a result are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations the following summary is not a comprehensive description of all enacted or pending laws regulations or official policies to which usas businesses are subject or that otherwise may affect those businesses the summary below addresses only selected areas and topics of special importance or interest further information concerning the nature and extent of federal state local and international regulation of businesses including online businesses may be obtained through review of legislation or rules adopted by the us congress and the various federal agencies by state and local legislative bodies and administrative agencies and by foreign countries and multinational entities 

internet regulation 

several of usas subsidiaries sell products or services to consumers over the internet currently relatively few laws and regulations apply directly to the internet and online commercial services to the extent such laws and regulations apply to certain of usas businesses usa believes that it is in compliance with all of them 

due to the growth of the internet and online commerce and to increasing concern with internet fraud new laws and regulations are continually being considered at the federal state and international level regarding intellectual property and similar ownership rights sales and other taxes pricing and content advertising and solicitation libel user privacy information security and other issues new laws or different applications of existing laws may increase or decrease the attractiveness to consumers of conducting business on the internet and might impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online such developments could increase or decrease the demand for products and services offered by certain of usas subsidiaries or affect their cost of doing business usa is not able to predict what laws may be adopted and the subsequent impact on usa and its subsidiaries 

on july 31 2002 the european union promulgated its email marketing directive which provides that the prior explicit consent of a consumer is required before email fax or automatic calling machines can be used to direct market to that consumer because implementation of the directive is not required until october 31 2003 it remains to be seen how the member states will translate the directive into national laws subject to european state lawmaking it is possible that usa subsidiaries operating in europe will be required to adapt their practices 

many of usas businesses transact substantial business over the internet federal legislation imposing limitations on the ability of states to impose taxes on internetbased sales was enacted in 1998 and extended in 2001 the internet tax nondiscrimination act as this legislation is known exempts certain types of sales transactions conducted over the internet from multiple or discriminatory state and local taxation through november 1 2003 it is possible that this legislation will not be renewed when it expires failure to renew this legislation could allow state and local governments to impose taxes on internetbased sales and these taxes could decrease the demand for products and services offered by certain of usas subsidiaries or increase such subsidiaries cost of operations 

consumer protection regulation 

generally the business of marketing and selling goods and services to consumers is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to protect consumers from false and misleading advertising unfair trade practices health and safety hazards and other risks consumer protection laws and regulations are enforced at the federal level by the federal trade commission ftc the federal communications commission fcc the food and drug administration fda the consumer product safety commission the environmental protection agency and other administrative agencies and at the state and local level by state attorneys general and numerous other law 

enforcement and administrative departments and agencies hsn especially faces considerable challenges in complying with these laws and rules because of the nature of its marketing medium—live unscripted television 24 hours a day seven days a week on two networks—particularly in light of aggressive enforcement by the ftc and state attorneys general of consumer protection laws against marketers in the direct response industry nonetheless usa believes that hsn and its other subsidiaries subject to these regulations are in compliance with them 

federal and state lawmakers and administrative agencies are actively considering a wide range of new or modified laws regulations and enforcement strategies these include for example possible restrictions on the use and sharing of consumer information restrictions on telemarketing and unsolicited email marketing changes in rules governing the use of endorsements and testimonials restrictions on the use of preacquired credit card account information and advance consent marketing expansion of liability to participants in marketing activities in addition to the advertiser heightened scrutiny of marketing claims for weightloss products dietary supplements and exercise equipment and increasingly severe penalties for violators usa is unable to predict which if any of these and other possible regulatory changes and enforcement priorities may be implemented and what effect they may have on the marketing activities of its subsidiaries 

certain of usas companies are subject to specialized regulation beyond the general requirements of truth in marketing enforced by the ftc for example hsn sells a diverse range of products to the public some of these products and representations about them may be subject to regulation by various regulatory agencies in addition to the ftc the sale of health or cosmetic products may be subject for example to regulation by the fda hsn reviews claims about products that it sells tests many of those products and maintains training and rigorous compliance programs to promote and secure compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

use of personally identifiable information customers in the ordinary course voluntarily provide usas various businesses with personally identifiable information pii pii includes information specific enough to identify a customer such as his or her name address telephone number or email address this information is used primarily to respond to and fulfill customer requests for the products and services offered by usas subsidiaries and their marketing partners sometimes the information is used to offer consumers products that may be of interest to them based upon their prior purchases from usas businesses 

the issue of consumer privacy has received substantial attention from federal state and foreign governments this attention has resulted in the enactment of certain laws and regulations and the consideration of many other proposals to safeguard consumer privacy pending proposals vary substantially and it is uncertain which if any may become law some proposals would require companies such as certain usa subsidiaries that sell the same product both online and offline to treat customer information obtained in such transactions differently depending upon the sales medium used some proposals would allow companies to use customer information for various purposes provided that consumers are given a choice and do not opt out of such uses while other proposals would prohibit such uses unless consumers are given a choice and explicitly authorize such uses by opting in usa cannot predict whether any of the proposed privacy legislation currently pending will be enacted or the effect if any that such legislation would have on usas businesses 

the federal and certain state governments already have enacted certain laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy the most farreaching of these current laws focus on financial institutions health care providers and companies that intentionally solicit information from children additionally the ftc has the authority to police consumer privacy commitments made by companies for example a claim that a company has violated a privacy policy that it has communicated to its customers may be actionable by the ftc 

the primary international privacy regulations to which certain of usas international operations are subject are canadas personal information and protection of electronic documents act pipeda and the european union data protection directive 

• canada the pipeda provides canadian residents with privacy protections in business transactions pipeda recognizes the individuals right to privacy in his or her personal information acknowledges the need of businesses to collect use and share personal information and establishes rules for handling personal information on january 1 2004 pipeda will be extended to the collection use or disclosure of personal information in the course of any commercial activity within a province • europe individual countries within the european union eu have specific regulations related to the crossborder transmission of personal information the eu data protection directive encompasses many of these individual regulations and requires companies doing business in eu member states to comply with its standards which require all noneu based companies doing business in eu member states to provide adequate data privacy protection and notice when sending personal data from any of the eu member states not all of the eu member states have implemented this directive in a uniform and consistent fashion in 2000 the eu member states adopted a safe harbor arrangement under which us businesses may adopt procedures that comply with european privacy regulations and certify their compliance through notice to the us department of commerce participation in the safe harbor qualifies a company to receive data from eu member states us companies that avail themselves of the safe harbor arrangement are subject to oversight and possible enforcement actions by the ftc or the department of transportation dot which has authority over ticket agents telephone sales and solicitations regulation 

several of usas subsidiaries sell and solicit the sale of products or services to customers over the telephone telephone transactions and solicitations are regulated by federal and state statutes and agencies 

the federal agencies primarily involved in regulating telephone solicitations and transactions are the fcc and the ftc fcc rules issued under the federal telephone consumer protection act of 1991 tcpa prohibit telephone solicitations to residential subscribers before 800 am or after 900 pm prohibit in certain circumstances the use of automated telephone dialing equipment and require certain disclosures by the caller including the soliciting companys telephone number or address in addition the fccs rules require the soliciting company to maintain a list of residential customers who have stated that they do not want to receive telephone solicitations from the company and prohibit the company from soliciting those customers the fcc rules also prohibit the use of prerecorded or artificial voice calls to consumers with limited exceptions and advertising via fax machines the fcc state attorneys general and private individuals may seek injunctive relief and money damages for violation of these fcc rules 

the federal telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act of 1994 tcfapa authorizes the ftc to issue regulations prohibiting misrepresentations in telephone sales in 1995 the ftc issued the telemarketing sales rule tsr the tsr imposes disclosure requirements for telemarketers when placing calls prohibits deceptive telemarketing acts or practices during solicitation sets guidelines for collecting payments by check and credit card and restricts abusive telephone solicitation practices the ftc state attorneys general and private individuals may seek injunctive relief and money damages for violation of the tsr 

in december 2002 the ftc announced amendments to the tsr to among other things establish a national do not call registry to enable consumers to eliminate most telemarketing calls where the consumer does not have an established business relationship with the seller regulate upselling 

activity require certain disclosures in offers involving negative option features such as free trials and recurring billing prohibit telemarketers from submitting consumers billing information for payment without their express verifiable informed consent or from improperly sharing it with anyone else for use in telemarketing and prohibit telemarketers from blocking or otherwise subverting caller id systems or with certain exceptions from engaging in call abandonment where a consumer who answers the telephone finds dead air most of the tsr amendments will become effective on march 31 2003 others will become effective at later dates implementation of the national do not call registry is expected this year as congress has recently authorized and provided funding for it usa believes that its subsidiaries comply with the tcpa and the fcc rules thereunder and with the tsr issued pursuant to the tcfapa 

in addition most states have enacted or are considering legislation to regulate telephone solicitations such state regulations restrict the methods and timing of telemarketing calls limit the percentage of abandoned calls generated through the use of automated telephonedialing equipment or software require that particular disclosures be made during the course of a telemarketing call require telemarketers to be licensed and bonded by state regulatory agencies in order to solicit within the state prevent telephone sales from becoming final unless a written contract is signed and returned by the buyer subject to cancellation within three business days andor require particular cancellation refund and return policies most states also have enacted and others are considering statewide do not call laws the violation of which could subject telemarketers to substantial fines penalties for violation of these state telemarketing regulations vary from state to state and may include criminal as well as civil penalties 

industryspecific regulations 

travel usas travelrelated businesses must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the sale of travel services these include registration in various states as a seller of travel or timeshare services compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds both the ftc and the dot take the position that their regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising practices apply to travel businesses in this regard the ftc recently released guidance to internet search companies concerning the inclusion of paid advertising and paid placement within search engine results the guidance announced the ftc staffs view that internet search engines that fail to identify and disclose such paid placement and paid advertising may be misleading consumers and may thus violate federal law although usa does not believe that any of its subsidiaries that sell travel services constitutes a search engine the ftc has indicated that its guidance also may apply to advertising and placement on travel websites 

usas travel businesses are also affected by regulatory and legal changes or uncertainties relating to travel suppliers and computer reservation systems crs for example heightened security procedures applicable to airline travel may affect the demand for such travel another example is the dots current review of its rules relating to crs while the dot stated in a notice of proposed rulemaking on november 12 2002 that it will not extend the crs rules to online services that sell airline tickets the dot could alter its position in its final rulemaking or otherwise choose to regulate such services in the future the proposed crs rules could also have an effect on usas travel businesses even if they do not technically apply to such businesses for example the proposed crs rules expressly seek to give airlines more flexibility in bargaining with crs which could result in any crs negotiating to receive less compensation from an airline such reduced compensation could cause the crs to attempt to reduce any segment fee payments to usas travel businesses for sales of that airlines tickets additionally if the dot elects to regulate online travel service providers fare displays such regulation may limit the ability of usas businesses to merchandise air travel in this regard the dots notice of proposed rulemaking proposes that travel agents itemize certain fees when displaying the total price for an airline ticket 

the sale to consumers of travel packages ie transportation plus accommodation is heavily regulated in europe the travel package regulations 1992 impose stringent requirements on providers of travel packages including duties to inspect proffered accommodations for compliance with local health and safety regulations tvts is subject to this law and believes it is in compliance with it while usa subsidiaries that do not sell directly to consumers do not believe that this law is applicable to them governmental authorities may take a different view usa does not believe that there would be a materially adverse effect on it if the law were applied to other usa subsidiaries in some circumstances 

the underlying services and goods sold by certain usa subsidiaries such as hotel rooms timeshares and car rentals are regulated domestically and internationally because these regulations directly affect the goods and services that are offered or exchanged by usas subsidiaries they may affect usas businesses the laws and regulations applicable to these goods and services are subject to change and usa is unable to predict what changes in the law may be adopted and the potential impact of any such changes on usas businesses 

some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodations tax or a form of sales tax on the use or occupancy of accommodations such taxes are normally collected from the consumer at the time of use consistent with industry practice hotelscom and expedia based on the room rates that the hotels charge them collect taxes from their customers and remit the taxes to the hotels for payment to the appropriate tax authorities expedia and hotelscom are conducting a continuing review and analysis of the tax laws in various states and jurisdictions concerning state and local sales and hotel occupancy taxes 

some tax authorities may assert that in some circumstances usa or its subsidiaries should collect and remit taxes on that part of their charges to customers which represents compensation for booking services the amount of any tax liability to usa and its subsidiaries on account of this issue would depend on the number of jurisdictions that prevail in assessing such additional tax expedia and hotelscom have not paid nor agreed to pay such taxes and intend to defend their positions vigorously should a jurisdiction prevail on such a claim usas subsidiaries may consider limiting liability for future transactions in that jurisdiction by passing on such taxes to the consumer 

ticketing ticketmaster is subject to certain state and local regulations including laws in several states establishing maximum convenience and processing charges on tickets for certain live events in the primary andor secondary ticketing markets other legislation that could affect the way ticketmaster does business including legislation that would further regulate convenience charges and orderprocessing fees is introduced from time to time in federal state and local legislative bodies ticketmaster is unable to predict whether any such legislation will be adopted and if so the impact thereof on its business 

ticketmaster has recently introduced and intends to continue to introduce in the future new products and services many of these products and services either have never previously existed or have developed rapidly due to the fast rate of change in internetbased business models as a result the impact of existing laws and regulations on these new products and services such as the provision of ticketing services in the secondary market is uncertain ticketmaster believes that its new products and services comply with existing laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not in the future be applied to these new products and services in unforeseen ways as such the impact of the application of such laws and regulations on certain of ticketmasters businesses cannot be foreseen and may have a material adverse effect on such businesses and the applicable products and services 

ticketmasters products and services are subject to various sales and use tax provisions under applicable state and local law the application of such tax provisions to ticketmasters established and new products and services is subject to the interpretation of the applicable taxing authority ticketmaster believes that it is in compliance with these tax provisions but there can be no assurance

trademarks tradenames copyrights patents domain names and other intellectual property rights 

usa regards its intellectual property rights including its service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to its success usa relies on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with its employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect its proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secret or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

usa has registered and continues to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate its trademarks and service marks and those of our wholly or partially owned subsidiaries as they are developed and used and reserves and registers domain names as it deems appropriate usa vigorously protects its trade and service marks and domain names but effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought by us in every country in which our products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered by us even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our contractual rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our chosen domain names 

usa has considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by the company 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by our company of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others this litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business patent litigation in particular tends to be protracted and expensive

in addition the competition for channel capacity has increased with the advent of digital cable and new compression technologies on the horizon this competition for channel capacity may substantially decrease although additional competitors may have the opportunity to enter the marketplace no prediction can be made with respect to the viability of these technologies or the extent to which they will ultimately impact the availability of channel capacity

other companies compete with ticketmaster by selling standalone automated ticketing systems to enable the facilities to do their own ticketing several of ticketmasters competitors have operations in multiple locations while others compete principally in one specific geographic location ticketmaster experiences substantial competition for potential client accounts and renewals of contracts on a regular basis accordingly there can be no assurance that prospective or renewal clients will enter into contracts with ticketmaster rather than ticketmasters competitors including clients that choose to selfdistribute with or without the assistance of the numerous companies that support selfdistribution ticketmaster competes on the basis of products and service provided capability of the ticketing system its distribution network reliability and price 

as an alternative to purchasing tickets through ticketmaster ticket purchasers generally may purchase tickets from the facilitys box office at which an event will be held or by season subscription or group sales directly from the venue or promoter of the event although ticketmasters clients may process sales of these tickets through the ticketmaster system ticketmaster derives no convenience charge or other processing revenue from the ticket purchasers with respect to those ticket purchases

transaction and the holdco exchange cable distribution fees increased as a result of new longterm carriage agreements signed in late 2001 and early 2002 charges of 12 million were incurred in 2001 related to employee terminations

nongaap financial measures 

the sec recently issued guidance regarding the use of nongaap financial measures which are defined as a numerical measures of a registrants historical or future financial performance financial position or cash flows that 

• exclude amounts or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap or • include amounts or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap usa executive management believes that certain nongaap measures including ebitda ebita adjusted net income adjusted eps and free cash flow are helpful when presented in conjunction with the comparable gaap measures the nongaap measures are not meant to replace or supercede the gaap measures but rather to supplement the information to present the readers of the financial statements the same information as management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of the business units 

when presenting nongaap financial measures the company will present a reconciliation of the most directly comparable gaap measures these nongaap measures are consistent with how management views the results of operations in assessing performance the final rules on these measures were just released in january so we like the rest of the world are in the process of interpreting the rules while we believe that the measures we present comply with the rules we will continue to monitor any developments in their interpretation accordingly we can give no assurance that we will be able to provide these or comparable measures in future filings 

nongaap financial measures fall into two categories—1 measures of performance that are different from that presented in the gaap financial statements for example net income versus adjusted net income or 2 measures of liquidity different from cash flow or cash flow from operations computed in accordance with gaap 

performance based measurements 

definitions of measurements that usa will use 

• adjusted ebita earnings before interest taxes amortization of intangibles noncash compensation and noncash marketing other income and expense and nonrecurring items including restructuring reserves • adjusted net income amounts that have been or ultimately will be settled in cash and the measure will be computed as net income plus 1 amortization of intangibles noncash distribution and marketing expense and noncash compensation expense 2 equity gainslosses on the vue partnership interest and 3 nonrecurring or unusual items including the cumulative effect of accounting changes that have not or are not reasonably likely to recur within two years all on an aftertax basis • adjusted eps adjusted net income divided by fully diluted shares outstanding including restricted stock issued without using the treasury method convention as the denominator going forward adjusted ebita adjusted net income and adjusted eps are the primary measures of usa executive management to review the operating performance of the business units in the past the company also used adjusted ebitda to measure performance as support these measures are prominently displayed in usas 2003 budget presentation the 

actual results received from the business units and investor presentations by usa executive management furthermore incentive compensation is directly linked to achieving adjusted ebita and adjusted net income targets previously adjusted ebitda as defined by usa was the primary measure of performance reviewed by management ebita has replaced ebitda primarily due to the change in the business from media and entertainment which is generally measured based on ebitda results the company believes that depreciation of capital expenditures especially capitalized technology spending is an important measure of performance it is important to note that usa does not adjust for noncash items because they are nonrecurring but rather because usa management excludes these items in reviewing the operating performance of the business units and the overall results of usa 

discussion of noncash items 

noncash distribution and marketing refers to arrangements whereby the company has secured distribution for its products and services in exchange for providing advertising and in some cases warrants to purchase stock in hotelscom sufficient advertising to satisfy the existing obligations has been secured pursuant to an agreement with universal tv formerly usa cable related to the usa transaction with vivendi universal entertainment the vue transaction the warrants were issued predominately at the time of hotelscom initial public offering current arrangements do not provide for cash payments to secure distribution 

to date noncash compensation has been a relatively small amount but the company intends to account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb statement no 123 and expense the fair value of the equity instruments over their vesting terms going forward the company intends to issue restricted stock and the accounting charge will be measured at the grant date and amortized ratably as noncash compensation over the vesting term the company anticipates that the expense related to restricted stock will increase over time management views the true cost of restricted stock as the resulting dilution to common shareholders rather than the estimated fair value of the instrument that is used to record the expense management may issue some options in the near term as it completes its shift to restricted stock stock option compensation is included in amortization of noncash compensation consistent with managements view that the true cost is the dilution for purposes of calculating adjusted net income per share all restricted shares are treated as outstanding for calculating the weighted average shares outstanding and the treasury method convention is not used to reduce the shares outstanding 

management views its acquisitions on a longterm basis the company has historically been acquisitive and as a result large balances of intangible assets have been estimated and recorded over time management evaluates acquisitions based on the total purchase price of the assets purchased versus the cash flows and income before noncash expenses that the businesses generate management does not consider the possible intangibles that may result from the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in making its acquisition decision and thus the resulting amortization of intangibles is not relevant to management in evaluating the results of operations on an ongoing basis the amounts created are indicative of accumulated intangibles that arose over time in some instances many years in establishing the business such as contractual relationships with suppliers and distributors and customer relationship and are not in lieu of future cash costs that may be incurred 

nonrecurring items 

the new rules offer guidelines for the treatment of nonrecurring items prohibiting adjustments identified as nonrecurring infrequent or unusual when 1 the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur within two years or 2 there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years usa will review items identified as nonrecurring in future periods to ensure they comply with this guidance 

reconciliation of nongaap measures to gaap measures and presentation 

when presenting nongaap financial measures the most directly comparable gaap measure will be presented in equal or greater prominence in addition usa will provide a reconciliation of each of the nongaap measures to the gaap measures 

usa believes that the most comparable gaap measures are as follows 



liquidity measurements 

definition of measurement that usa will use 

• free cash flow gaap cash flow from operations less capital expenditures payments of preferred dividends and funding to unconsolidated subsidiaries for operating purposes free cash flow fcf is the primary measure of usa executive management to review the ability of the business units to convert operating performance into cash which can then be used to support reinvestments in current operations acquisitions or other strategic purposes this measure is prominently displayed in usas 2003 budget presentation the actual results received from the business units and investor presentations by usa executive management 

discussion of elements of computation 

capital expenditures taken directly from the cash flow statement are utilized in the computation since they represent a significant portion of the companys cash expenditures and are a direct reinvestment in the business units to increase future performance the dividend on the preferred shares represents a financing decision by usa so the dividend payments are treated similar to interest payments which are included in operating cash flow funding to unconsolidated subsidiaries for operating purposes historically related to funding to hot networks as each partner in the venture funded losses since hot networks was not consolidated the funding was not reflected in operating cash flows it is not expected that usa will continue to incur such costs as hot networks is now consolidated and the companys other joint ventures do not require significant cash funding 

reconciliation of nongaap measures to gaap measures 

usa believes that the most comparable gaap measure is cash flow from operations which is the starting point of fcf 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

   commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events such as under lines of credit extended or under guarantees of debt critical accounting policies

• the prevailing accounting guidance applied by hotelscom and expedia with respect to the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis is contained in staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements as later clarified by emerging issues task force no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 9919 the consensus of this literature is that the presentation of revenue as the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained that is the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a commission or fee is a matter of judgment that depends on 72 

the relevant facts and circumstances if the conclusion drawn is that the company performs as an agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods revenue should be reported on a net basis in making an evaluation of this issue some of the factors that should be considered are 

• if the company is the primary obligor in the arrangement—strong indicator • if the company has general inventory risk before customer order is placed or upon customer return—strong indicator and • if the company has latitude in establishing price eitf 9919 clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors which at times can be contradictory are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity the positions taken by hotelscom and expedia reflect their interpretation of their respective fact patterns as well as their qualitative weighing of the indicators outlined in eitf 9919 see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies revenues in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the factors considered by hotelscom and expedia in arriving at their conclusions 

for comparison purposes in order to provide the reader with a more complete discussion on this topic we present pro forma information under the assumption of both companies presenting revenue on a net basis and both companies presenting revenue on a gross basis including the pro forma impact on the usa consolidated revenues and the separate segment revenues of hotelscom and expedia 

assuming that both companies presented merchant revenue on a net basis usas pro forma net revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 would have been 40 billion and 31 billion respectively assuming that both companies presented revenue on a gross basis usas pro forma net revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 would have been 53 billion and 42 billion respectively 

for hotelscom assuming that it presented merchant revenue on a net basis hotelscom pro forma net revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 would have been 2877 million and 1662 million respectively 

for expedia assuming that it presented merchant revenue on a gross basis expedias pro forma net revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 would have been 12 billion and 7359 million respectively 

seasonality 

usas businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality 

usa believes seasonality impacts its electronic retailing segment but not to the same extent it impacts the retail industry in general 

ticketing operations revenues are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by the client the second quarter of the year generally experiences the most ticket onsales for events 

hotelscoms and expedias revenues are influenced by the seasonal nature of holiday travel in the markets it serves and has historically peaked in the fall as the businesses expand into new markets the impact of seasonality is expected to lessen 

tvts revenues are influenced by the seasonal nature of package travel with the first and third quarters generally experiencing the strongest sales and the second and the fourth quarter experiencing weaker sales 

intervals revenues from existing members are influenced by the seasonal nature of planned family travel with the first quarter generally experiencing the strongest sales and the fourth quarter generally experiencing weaker sales intervals new member revenues are generally strongest in the third quarter influenced by the seasonal nature of timeshare sales by its developer clients 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the companys exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys shortterm investment portfolio and issuance of debt the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio the company has a prescribed methodology whereby it invests its excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers the portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis and adjusted in the event that the credit rating of a security held in the portfolio has deteriorated 

as of december 31 2002 the companys outstanding debt approximated 12 billion substantially all of which is fixed rate obligations if market rates decline the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on the current market rate 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company conducts business in certain foreign markets primarily in the european union the company has exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar to the euro however the company intends to reinvest profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses 

as the company increases its operations in international markets it becomes increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company are often linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 

as currency exchange rates change translation of the income statements of the companys international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically the company has not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally further the company has not entered into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because the company has not believed it is justified by the attendant cost 

foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the companys earnings for 2002 or 2001 however given the currency fluctuations in 2002 and anticipated increases in the companys operations in international markets the company is reviewing its strategy for hedging 

equity price risk 

the company has a minimal investment in equity securities of publicly traded companies these investments as of december 31 2002 were considered availableforsale with the unrealized gain deferred as a component of shareholders equity it is not customary for the company to make significant investments in equity securities as part of its investment strategy 

the company has substantial investments in vue as of december 31 2002 including preferred interests valued at approximately 2 billion and common interests valued at 1 billion the company has reviewed the carrying value of these investments and believes they are reasonable see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the carrying value of these securities

description of technologies

background


                                        2

fatigue is a consequence of a metal object undergoing repeated cyclic strain
in a commercial context this strain and concomitant stress comes about as a
result of a large number of cycles of loading and unloading  sudden fracture
can result  fatigue damage and the resulting compromise of stability and
integrity of the member experiencing fatigue presents the potential for
structural failure and extreme danger  objects such as bridges and airplane
wings are subject to fatigue and it is obvious that sudden fracture of such
structures would have disastrous results  it is presently not possible under
any generally acceptable theory of fatigue phenomena to predict by analysis
alone when the limit is reached and when a fracture may occur  further in
normal usage damage occurs cumulatively at microscopic levels and can only be
detected in the early stages at a time when dire results can be avoided by
examining the microscopic structure

this difficulty has caused designers of structures subject to fatigue to be
extremely conservative by designing structures in a manner which maintains the
stresses presented in critical areas of a structure at a level well below the
known endurance limits of the material employed  in many instances this results
in extreme expense  in spite of this over designing catastrophic fatigue
failures still occur  thus there is a need for a means of measuring the state
of fatigue life since the best available methods of analysis are very
inadequate

the fatigue fuse

the fatigue fuse is designed to be affixed to a structure to give warnings as
preselected portions of the fatigue life have been used up ie how far to
failure the structure has progressed  it warns against a condition of
widespread generalized cracking due to fatigue  it has been proven to work as
expected however additional application engineering is required before
beginning a marketing campaign  it is estimated this effort will cost
approximately 600000 and will take 612 months to complete

the fatigue fuse is a thin piece of metal similar to the material being
monitored  it consists of a series of parallel metal strips connected to a
common base much as fingers are attached to a hand  each finger has a
different geometric pattern called notches defining its boundaries  each
finger incorporates a design specific notch near the base  by applying the laws
of physics to determine the geometric contour of each notch the fatigue life of
each finger is finite and predictable  when the fatigue life of a finger fuse
is reached the fuse breaks

by implementing different geometry for each finger in the array different
increments of fatigue life are observable  typically notches will be designed
to facilitate observing increments of fatigue life of 10 to 20  by
mechanically attaching or bonding these devices to different areas of the
structural member of concern the fuse undergoes the same fatigue history
strain cycles as the structural member  therefore breakage of a fuse
indicates that an increment of fatigue life has been reached for the structural
member  the notch and the size and shape of the notch concentrate energy on
each finger  the fuse is intimately attached to the structural member of
interest  therefore the fuse experiences the same load history as the member

management believes that the fatigue fuse will be of value in monitoring
aircraft ships bridges conveyor systems mining equipment cranes etc  no
special training will be needed to qualify individuals to report any broken
segments of the fatigue fuse to the appropriate engineering authority for
necessary action  the success of the device is contingent upon matechs
successful development and marketing of the fatigue fuse and no assurance can
be given that matech will be able to overcome the obstacles relating to
introducing a new product to the market  to determine its ability to produce
and market the fatigue fuse matech needs substantial additional capital and no
assurance can be given that needed capital will be available

in a new structure we can generally assume there is no fatigue and can thus
design the fatigue fuse for 100 of its life potential  but in an existing
structure one that has experienced loading we must determine the fatigue

status of that structural member so we can design the fatigue fuse to monitor
the remaining fatigue life potential  the efs is dedicated to that purpose

electrochemical fatigue sensor efs

in august 1993 tensiodyne a predecessor of the company entered into two
agreements a license agreement and a development agreement with the university
of pennsylvania regarding a new invention designed to measure electrochemically
the status of fatigue of a structure without knowing the structures past
loading history under the license agreement 12500 shares of tensiodynes
common stock were issued a 5 royalty on sales of this product was granted and
under the development agreement tensiodyne agreed to pay 11112 per month for
18 months for a total payment of 200000 as of this date no payments have
been made on this obligation on december 17 1997 the company and the
university modified the terms of the licensing agreement and related obligation
the terms of the modified agreements include an increase in the universitys
royalty to 7 of the sale of related products additional shares of our common
stock to equal 5 of the companys outstanding common stock until the company
receives an additional 2000000 in paid in capital and to pay to the
university 30 of any amounts the company raises in excess of 150000
excluding amounts received on government grants or contracts up to 200000
plus interest at 15 per month from june 30 1997

the efs is a device that employs the principle of electrochemicalmechanical
interaction to measure the state of fatigue damage in a metal structural member
it is expected to provide a means for determining the fatigue status of that
member so that appropriate action monitor replacement or repair can be taken
before structural failure occurs

the efs functions by treating the location of interest the target associated
with the structural member as an electrode of an electrochemical cell  to
complete the electrocellular reaction an electrolyte in the form of a low
corrosion gel is placed in contact with the target  by imposing a constant
voltageequivalent circuit as the control mechanism for the electrochemical
reaction  at the target surface  current flows as a function of stress action
the efs is always a dynamic process therefore stress action is required eg
to measure a bridge structural member it is necessary that cyclic loads be
imposed as normal traffic on the bridge would do  the results are a specific
set of current waveforms and amplitudes that is expected to characterize and
report fatigue damage

stress points are very often located in difficulttoaccess places for humans
therefore it has become desirable to miniaturize the process and develop a
means for delivery to inaccessible areas   in order to address this development
issue the company utilizes borescope technology which is a technology that is
currently under development  the company is highly dependent on this technology
for the marketing of our products

development of technologies

status of the fatigue fuse

the development and application sequence for the fatigue fuse and efs is a
basic research b exploratory development c advanced development d
prototype evaluation e application demonstration and f commercial sales
and service  the fatigue fuse came first  the inventor professor maurice
brull conducted the basic research at the university of pennsylvania  matech
conducted the advanced development including variations of the adhesive bonding
process and fabricating a laboratorygrade remote recorder for finger
separation events that monitor the functioning of the fatigue fuse  the next
step prototype evaluation encompassing empirical tailoring of fuse parameters
to fit the actual spectrum loading expected in specific applications needs to
be done  the associated tests include both coupon specimens and fullscale
structural tests with attached fuses  a prototype of a flight qualifiable
operational separation event recorder application was designed fabricated and


                                        4
page
successfully demonstrated  the next tasks will be to prepare a mathematical
analysis for more efficient selection of fuse parameters and to conduct a
comprehensive test program to prove the ability of the fatigue fuse to
accurately indicate fatigue damage when subjected to realistically large
variations in spectrum loading  the final tasks prior to marketing will be an
even larger group of demonstration tests

the fatigue fuse is at its final stages of testing and development for its
flightqualified application  to begin marketing the fuse will take from 6 to
12 months and cost approximately 600000 including technical and beta testing
and final development  if testing development and marketing are successful
management estimates matech should begin receiving revenue from the sale of the
fatigue fuse within a year of receiving these funds  management cannot estimate
the amount of revenue that may be realized from sales of the fuse

to date certain organizations have included matechs fatigue fuse in test
programs already completed are tests for welded steel civil bridge members
conducted at the university of rhode island  in 1996 westland helicopter a
british firm tested the fatigue fuse on helicopters  that test was successful
with the legs of the fuses failing in sequence as predicted

status of the efs

the efs currently has certain limitations  to obtain meaningful measurements
the device requires that at least 50 of the fatigue life has occurred  also
the device has only been perfected for commercial use with mild and soft steels
this limits the use of efs presently to such applications as bridges ships
cranes etc  use in more exotic structures such as aircraft and turbine engines
applications is currently precluded  although there is a vast body of testing
supporting successful use of this methodology for selected aluminum alloys to
date there has not been any confirmed success in aircraft and turbine engines
management cannot assure that the method will work in the field

government funded efs programs

in august 1996 the company executed a teaming agreement with southwest research
institute swri and the university of pennsylvania for research development
and efs enhancement efforts  on february 25 1997 swri was awarded a 25
million phase i contract to determine the feasibility of the efs to improve the
        
u s air force capability to perform durability assessments of military
aircraft including air frames and engines through the application of the efs to
specific military aircraft alloys  matechs directly subcontracted share of
this award was approximately 500000  but the efs was enhanced by the entire
funding used by swri and upa  on june 18 1998 universal technology corporation
utc a new matech associate was awarded a second contract in the amount of
                                             
2061642 to determine the applicability of the efs to improve the u s air
force capability to perform durability assessments of military aircraft
including both air frames and engines through the application of the efs to
specific military aircraft alloys  matechs share of this award was
approximately 538000 but the efs was enhanced by the entire funding used by
utc swri and other subcontractors to matech  on february 5 1999a third
                                                                     
contract in the amount of 2000000 was awarded to utcto continue and expand
the efforts for turbine engines  matechs directly subcontracted share was
approximately 382000  the efs was similarly enhanced by the entire awarded
program  a fourth contract was awarded to utc on november 3rd 2000 to continue
            
the borescope and efs technologies as well as alternate means of fatigue
sensing  matechs directly subcontracted share of this contract is
approximately 700000

accordingly over the last 4 years approximately 85 million was awarded to
conduct extensive engineering to enhance the performance of the efs for
government aircraftengine applications  the results of this research are
encouraging and provide a basis for the company and its partners to obtain
additional funding  no assurance can be given however that such funding will
be received


                                        5

the company continues in its efforts to raise funds from numerous sources
including various state and federal governmental agencies andor private or
public offerings of securities  at this time however the company has no firm
agreements or commitments that sufficient capital will be available in order to
continue our research development or operations

commercial applications of the companys technologies

no commercial application of matechs products has been arranged to date but
the technology has matured to a point where it can with further development in
the opinion of management be applied to certain markets matechs technology is
applicable to many market sectors such as bridges and aerospace as well as
ships cranes power plants nuclear facilities chemical plants mining
equipment piping systems and heavy iron matech has chosen to begin
commercialization in the bridge market the second market sector that will be
pursued is aerospace the aerospace industry is concerned with aluminum alloys
and titanium alloys this market opportunity will follow a different time line
budget and market model there can be no assurance of success until our
technologies and our products are successfully installed in the field and have
passed required testing and validation

the bridge market

in the us alone there are over 610000 bridges of which over 260000 are rated
by the federal highway administration as requiring major repair rehabilitation
or replacement  although there are normal business imperatives the market is
essentially macroeconomically and government policy driven  in the opinion of
management only technology can provide the solution  the need for increased
spending accelerates significantly each year as infrastructure ages  analysis
by infrastructure economic experts including the federal highway
administration confirms that 9 billion per year for bridges alone is the
minimum required to maintain the status quo  since that amount has not been
available and a backlogged repair bill of more than 358 billion has already
accrued greater efficiencies in the management of current budgets are the only
solution  in the 1991 istea initiative intermodal surface transportation and
efficiency act and recently in the 200 billion 1998 tea21 initiative
transportation equity act bridge management systems have been mandated as a
matter of policy

manufacturing

certain manufacturers are capable of producing the fatigue fuse and efs at
reasonable cost  no assurance can be given however that these devices will be
successfully manufactured that they can be commercially produced that they
will perform to managements expectations or that they will be successfully
marketed  moreover significant competition may develop

patents

matech is the assignee of four patents originally issued to tensiodyne
corporation  the first was issued on may 27 1986 and expires on may 27 2003
it is titled device for monitoring fatigue life and bears united states patent
office numbers 4590804  the second patent titled method of making a device
for monitoring fatigue life was issued on february 3 1987 and expires february
3 2004 united states patent office number 4639997  the third patent titled
metal fatigue detector was issued on august 24 1993 and expires on august 24
2010 united states patent number 5237875  the fourth patent titled device
for monitoring the fatigue life of a structural member and a method of making
same was issued on june 14 1994 and expires on june 14 2011 united states
patent number 5319982  in addition the company owns a fifth patent titled
device for monitoring the fatigue life of a structural member and a method of
making same with united states patent number 5425274

product distribution methods

provided there are funds to support such activities as to which no assurance
can be given matech intends to exhibit the fatigue fuse and the electrochemical


                                        6
page
fatigue sensor at various trade shows and will also market its products directly
to end users including aircraft manufacturing and aircraft maintenance
companies crane manufactures and operators certain state regulatory agencies
charged with overseeing bridge maintenance companies engaged in manufacturing
and maintaining large ships and tankers and the military although management
intends to undertake marketing dependent on the availability of funds within
and with out the united states no assurance can be given that any such
marketing activities will be implemented and accordingly we can make no
assurance that significant revenue can be generated by the company in the
marketing and sales of the fatigue fuse or the efs

competition

other technologies exist which indicate fatigue damage  single cracks larger
than a minimum size can be found by nondestructive inspection methods such as
dye penetrant radiography eddy current acoustic emission and ultrasonics
tracking of load and strain history to subsequently estimate fatigue damage by
computer processing is possible with recording instruments such as strain
gauges and counting accelerometers  these methods have been used for 40 years
and also offer the advantage of having been accepted in the market whereas
matechs products remain largely unproven for some currently indeterminable
period  companies marketing these alternate technologies include magnaflux
corporation krautkremerbranson duneganendevco and micromeasurements
these companies have more substantial assets greater experience and more
resources than matech including but not limited to established distribution
channels and an established computer base  the familiarity and loyalty to these
technologies may be difficult to dislodge  because matech is still in its
development stage it is unable to predict whether its technologies will be
successfully developed and commercially attractive in potential markets

employees

the company has four employees robert m bernstein president and chief
executive officer a secretary and two part time engineers  in addition the
company retains consultants for specialized work such as an accountant who
oversees the companys government contracts









item 2  properties

the company leases an office at 11661 san vicente blvd suite 707 los angeles
california 90049 the space consists of 830 square feet and will be adequate
for the companys current and foreseeable needs the total rent is payable at
2348 per month through may 31 2002 the company has extended its lease
through december 31 2002 at the same rent

matech owns a remote monitoring system and certain equipment that is being used
by the university of pennsylvania for instructional and testing purposes  the
company determined that the system has no future use and probably cannot be
sold  therefore the company charged its full costs of 97160 to operations in
1998

liquidity and capital resources

there has been little change in the companys operations for the past three
years it still seeks capital for the development of its projects and to
maintain its patents the company is still totally dependent on the willingness
of the companys president mr bernstein and long time investors in the
company to loan the company money or purchase additional securities from the
company over the next year the company hopes to receive additional funds from
the u s air force these funds however are not guaranteed in 2001 the

company raised a net 286567 through the issuance of 4932358 shares of its
common stock through its regulation s offering also in 2001 the company
entered into an agreement with allied boston international for a straight
documentary credit for 12500000the funding under this instrument is also not
guaranteed if the 12500000 is raised management believes the amount should
be sufficient to fund the completion of its research projects and bring them to
market although mr bernstein intends to continue to loan the company funds as
required while it seeks additional financing he is under no obligation to do
so the company does not expect to receive any additional material financing
from its other long time investors

any prediction of the likelihood or timing of obtaining the required funding
would be highly speculative the companys ability to obtain such financing may
depend on the results of the research contracts with the us air force
