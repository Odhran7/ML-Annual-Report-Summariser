eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10‑q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports including related exhibits and supplemental schedules filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is wwweogresourcescom information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this report 

at december 31 2021 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 3747 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1548 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 829 mmbbl were ngls reserves and 8222 billion cubic feet bcf or 1370 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 99 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states and 1 in trinidad crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

eogs operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related for information regarding the risks associated with eogs domestic and foreign operations see item 1a risk factors 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet eog is focused on innovation and costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models and the use of improved drilling equipment and completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks and costs associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance is integral in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are located in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2021 on a crude oil equivalent basis 42 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 22 were ngls and 36 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio 

the following is a summary of wellhead volume statistics and net well completions for the year ended december 31 2021 total net acres at december 31 2021 and expected net well completions planned for 2022 for certain areas of eogs united states operations 





1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

in the delaware basin eog completed 288 net wells during 2021 primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp bone spring and leonard plays the delaware basin consists of approximately 4800 feet of oil rich stacked pay potential offering eog multiple codevelopment opportunities throughout its 395000 net acre position 

in the delaware basin wolfcamp play eog has completed 189 net wells in 2021 continued improvement and excellent results in the delaware basin wolfcamp program were supported by optimized well spacing and codevelopment enhanced well completions precision drilling and continued cost reductions in 2022 the delaware basin wolfcamp play will continue to be a primary area of focus 

in the bone spring play eog has three main subplays the first second and third bone spring in 2021 eog completed 79 total net bone spring wells within the three subplays of the three subplays the second bone spring had the majority of the activity in 2021 with eog completing 63 net wells the bone spring play continues to be an integral part of eogs delaware basin plans and portfolio 

in the leonard play eog maintained its development plan with 20 net wells completed in 2021 eog has tested codevelopment of up to three leonard zones simultaneously and expects the leonard play to become a more active part of eogs program in the next several years 

activity in 2022 will remain focused on the delaware basin wolfcamp bone spring and leonard plays where eog expects to complete approximately 375 net wells 

the south texas area includes our eagle ford oil play and our dorado gas play eog holds approximately 516000 total net acres in the prolific oil window of the eagle ford oil play and approximately 160000 net acres in the dorado gas play in the dorado gas play eog has continued to delineate the eagle ford and austin chalk formations with excellent results in 2021 eog completed 155 net eagle ford oil play wells and 11 net wells in the dorado gas play in 2022 eog expects to complete approximately 95 net eagle ford oil play wells and 30 net dorado wells 

activity in the rocky mountain area in 2021 was focused on the wyoming powder river basin in the powder river basin eog operated a tworig program and completed 45 net wells in the niobrara mowry turner and parkman formations in addition key infrastructure was added in order to lower operating costs and increase price realizations going forward in the dj basin eog drilled and completed one net well in the codell formation in the williston basin eog completed four net wells in the bakken and three forks formations activity in both the dj and williston basins is expected to be minimal in 2022 as development remains focused on the powder river basin where eog plans to complete approximately 40 net wells 

operations outside the united states 

eog has operations offshore trinidad and is making preparations to drill offshore australia as well as evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas in addition eog is in the process of exiting block 36 and block 49 in the sultanate of oman oman and is executing an abandonment and reclamation program in canada eog sold its operations in the china sichuan basin china in the second quarter of 2021 

trinidad eog through its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited holds interests in i the exploration and production licenses covering the south east coast consortium secc block pelican and banyan fields sercan area and each of their related facilities and the ska mento reggae and deep teak saaman and poui areas all of which are offshore trinidad and ii a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for each of the modified ua modified ub and 4a blocks 

several fields in the secc modified ua modified ub and 4a blocks banyan field and sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate 

in march 2021 eog signed a farmout agreement with heritage petroleum company limited heritage which allows eog to earn a 65 working interest in a portion of the contract area eog area governed by the trinidad northern area license the eog area is located offshore the southwest coast of trinidad 

in 2021 eogs net production averaged approximately 217 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 15 mbbld of crude oil and condensate in 2021 eog made progress on the design and fabrication of a platform and related facilities for its previously announced discovery in the modified ua block 

in 2022 eog expects to drill one net exploratory well in the eog area in addition to three development wells and one exploratory well in the modified ua block 

australia on april 22 2021 a subsidiary of eog entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a 100 interest in the wa488p block located offshore western australia on november 19 2021 the petroleum exploration permit for that block was transferred to that subsidiary 

in 2022 eog will continue preparing for the drilling of an exploration well which is expected to commence in 2023 

oman  eog through its subsidiaries holds interests in exploration and production sharing agreements in block 36 and block 49 located in oman 

in 2021 eogs partner in block 49 completed the drilling and testing of one net exploratory well which was determined to be a dry hole eog notified its partner and the ministry of energy and minerals of its intention to withdraw from block 49 additionally eog drilled two exploratory wells and completed one exploratory well in block 36 there was a discovery of natural gas in block 36 but the well results did not yield sufficient projected returns for eog to move forward with the project in 2022 eog expects to exit block 36 in oman 

china in may 2021 eog completed the sale of all of its interest in eog resources china limited eog no longer has any operations or assets in china eogs net production averaged approximately 25 mmcfd of natural gas prior to the sale 

canada in march 2020 eog began the process of exiting its canada operations in the horn river area in northeast british columbia 

marketing 

in 2021 eog continued its diversified approach to marketing its wellhead crude oil and condensate production the majority of eogs united states wellhead crude oil and condensate production was transported by pipeline to downstream markets with the remainder sold into local markets major us sales areas accessed by eog were at various locations along the us gulf coast including houston and corpus christi texas cushing oklahoma the permian basin and the midwest in 2021 eog also sold crude oil at the houston ship channel and the port of corpus christi for export to foreign destinations in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location in 2022 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same at december 31 2021 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of crude oil of 16 mmbbls in 2022 7 mmbbls in 2023 7 mmbbls in 2024 and 1 mmbbls in 2025 all of which is expected to be sourced from future production of available reserves 

in 2021 eog processed certain of its united states wellhead natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices into either local markets or downstream locations in certain instances eog exchanged its ngl production for purity products received downstream which were sold at prevailing market prices in 2022 such pricing mechanisms are expected to remain the same in 2021 eog also sold purity products at the houston ship channel for export to foreign destinations in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location in 2022 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same at december 31 2021 eog was not committed to deliver fixed quantities of ngls in 2022 

in 2021 consistent with its diversified marketing strategy the majority of eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was transported by pipeline to various locations including katy texas east texas the agua dulce hub in south texas the cheyenne hub in weld county colorado southern california and chicago illinois remaining natural gas production was sold into local markets in each case pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point in 2022 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same additionally eog sells natural gas to a liquefaction facility near corpus christi texas and receives pricing based on the platts japan korea marker at december 31 2021 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of natural gas of 223 bcf in 2022 190 bcf in 2023 150 bcf in 2024 138 bcf in 2025 195 bcf in 2026 and 1459 bcf thereafter all of which is expected to be sourced from future production of available reserves 

in 2021 natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under a fixed price contract ending in 2026 the pricing mechanism for production in trinidad is expected to remain the same in 2022 

through may 2021 all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments 

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm capacity at thirdparty facilities with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2021 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues the two purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

covid19 pandemic  in 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic eog focused on keeping its employees and their families safe including providing technology and support to employees to enable them to not only work safely and productively from the office or at home but also to remain engaged and connected across the company in 2021 eog continued to provide such technology and support and remained focused on the safety of its employees reopening its offices and worksites in a phased approach and instituting additional practices and protocols including those related to social distancing mask wearing and symptom screening 

training and development  eog focuses on developing its employees for meaningful career opportunities including promotion into supervisory and management positions and enhanced compensation opportunities eog provides training in leadership management skills communication team effectiveness technical skills and use of eog systems and applications eogs leadership training is focused on providing continuity of leadership at eog by further developing the skills needed to lead a multidisciplined diverse and decentralized workforce in addition eog holds several internal technical conferences each year designed to share best practices and technical advances across the company including safety and environmental topics eog also offers its employees a tuition reimbursement program as well as reimbursement for the costs of professional certifications 

diversity and inclusion  eog believes gender racial ethnic and cultural diversity and diversity in background and experience leads to diversity of thought which is valued by eog as part of its effort to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace eog focuses on creating a collaborative culture that fosters inclusion at all levels of the company and reflects the diversity of thought of its employees eog also takes steps to raise employee awareness provide leadership and offer training to help advance diversity and inclusion within eog further as reflected in its code of business conduct and ethics for directors officers and employees eog is committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and to hiring evaluating and promoting employees based on skills and performance 

safety  eogs safety management programs and processes provide a framework within which management can assess safety performance in a systematic way eogs safety performance is also considered in evaluating employee performance and compensation eog provides initial periodic and refresher safety training to employees as well as to contractors and others who may work at or visit eogs facilities these training programs address various topics including operating procedures safe work practices and emergency and incident response procedures 

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil ngls and natural gas certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition from competing energy sources such as renewable energy sources see item 1a risk factors 

regulation 

general new or revised rules regulations and policies may be issued and new legislation may be proposed that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry such rules regulations policies and legislation may affect among other things i permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands ii the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development iii the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions andor other climate changerelated matters associated with oil and gas operations iv the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands v the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and vi us federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies for additional discussion regarding the regulatoryrelated risks to which eogs operations financial condition and results of operations are or may be subject see the below discussion and item 1a risk factors 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests on federal lands from time to time the us department of the interior has also considered limiting or pausing new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters any limitation or ban on permitting for oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands could have a material and adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities supporting eogs operations in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the fort worth basin barnett shale in north texas the williston basin bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2021 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and other federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation generally  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however eog is unable to predict i the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding the environment and ii the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations relating to such future laws and regulations the direct and indirect cost of such laws and regulations in enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years the us congress has from time to time proposed legislation for imposing restrictions or requiring fees or carbon taxes for ghg emissions in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act further the us epa in may 2016 issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds voc from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in november 2021 the epa proposed a rule to further reduce methane and voc emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector 

at the international level the us in december 2015 participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 and which the united states formally rejoined in february 2021 the united states has established economywide targets of i reducing its net ghg emissions by 5052 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and ii achieving net zero ghg emissions economywide by no later than 2050 in addition many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord further in november 2021 the us department of the interior released its report on the federal oil and gas leasing program which recommended increasing royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 as amended 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations treaties or policies regarding climate change and ghg emissions including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the us but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations treaties or policies if enacted issued or applied could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations the potential increase in the costs of our operations could include costs to operate and maintain our facilities install new emissions controls on our facilities acquire allowances or credits to cover our ghg emissions pay taxes or fees related to our ghg emissions or administer and manage a ghg emissions program in addition changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghg emissions or restrictions on their use could also adversely affect market demand for and in turn the prices we receive for our production of crude oil ngls and natural gas further the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business see item 1a risk factors for additional discussion regarding climate changerelated developments 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states substantially all of the onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa has also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in november 2021 the epa proposed a rule to further reduce methane and voc emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector from time to time there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level 

in addition to the abovedescribed federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements operating restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with laws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however eog is unable to predict i the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states or other aspects of our operations and ii the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations relating to such future laws and regulations the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations outside the united states associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas outside the united states where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas during the last three years average united states commodity prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 77 in 2021 decreased 33 in 2020 and decreased 11 in 2019 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 156 in 2021 decreased 16 in 2020 and decreased 40 in 2019 each as compared to the immediately preceding year fluctuations in average natural gas prices received by eog for production in the united states resulted in a 203 increase in 2021 a 27 decrease in 2020 and a 23 decrease in 2019 each as compared to the immediately preceding year 

due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries and the duration and impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the global supply of and demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in the prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices the potential impacts on eog and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs crude oil and ngl derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2022 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 107 million for net income and 138 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2022 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 15 million for net income and 19 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2022 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  commodity derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31 2021 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2022 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ‑ capital resources and liquidity  commodity derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil ngl and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil ngl and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes flooding and other adverse weather events moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce eogs revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover for any incident involving eogs operations which results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

risks related to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

crude oil ngls and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

• domestic and worldwide supplies of and consumer and industrialcommercial demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas 

• domestic and international drilling activity 

• the actions of other crude oil producing and exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries 

• worldwide economic conditions geopolitical factors and political conditions including but not limited to the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics pandemics or other public health issues such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation gathering processing compression storage refining and export facilities 

• the price and availability of and demand for competing energy sources including alternative energy sources 

• the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures alternative fuel requirements and climate changerelated policies initiatives and developments 

• technological advances and consumer and industrialcommercial behavior preferences and attitudes in each case affecting energy generation transmission storage and consumption 

• the nature and extent of governmental regulation including environmental and other climate changerelated regulation regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil ngls and natural gas and related commodities 

• the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including trading by commodity price speculators and others and 

• natural disasters weather conditions and changes in weather patterns 

the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict crude oil ngls and natural gas prices in 2022 and thereafter as a result there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil ngls andor natural gas will sustain or increase from their current levels nor can there be any assurance that the prices for crude oil ngls andor natural gas will not decline 

our cash flows financial condition and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and operating expenses the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets our results of operations and our financial condition including but not limited to our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and also possibly shut in or plug and abandon certain wells in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which would require us to write down the value of our properties such reserve writedowns and asset impairments can materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

developments related to climate change may have a material and adverse effect on us 

governmental and regulatory bodies investors consumers industry and other stakeholders have been increasingly focused on climate change matters in recent years this focus together with changes in consumer and industrialcommercial behavior preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy the use of crude oil ngls and natural gas and the use of products manufactured with or powered by crude oil ngls and natural gas may result in i the enactment of climate changerelated regulations policies and initiatives at the government corporate andor investor community levels including alternative energy requirements and energy conservation measures ii technological advances with respect to the generation transmission storage and consumption of energy eg wind solar and hydrogen power smart grid technology and battery technology and iii increased availability of and increased consumer and industrialcommercial demand for nonhydrocarbon energy sources eg alternative energy sources and products manufactured with or powered by nonhydrocarbon sources eg electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies these developments may adversely affect the demand for products manufactured with or powered by crude oil ngls and natural gas and the demand for and in turn the prices of the crude oil ngls and natural gas that we sell see the risk factor above for a discussion of the impact of commodity prices including fluctuations in commodity prices on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

in addition to potentially adversely affecting the demand for and prices of the crude oil ngls and natural gas that we sell such developments may also adversely impact among other things the availability to us of necessary thirdparty services and facilities that we rely on which may increase our operational costs and adversely affect our ability to explore for produce transport and process crude oil ngls and natural gas and successfully carry out our business strategy for further discussion of the potential impact of such risks on our financial condition and results of operations see the discussion in the section below entitled risks related to our operations 

further climate changerelated developments may result in negative perceptions of the oil and gas industry and in turn reputational risks associated with the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons such negative perceptions and reputational risks may adversely affect our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy for example by adversely affecting the availability and cost to us of capital for further discussion of the potential impact of such risks on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations see the discussion below in this section and in the section below entitled risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

in addition the enactment of climate changerelated regulations policies and initiatives at the government corporate andor investor community levels may also result in increases in our compliance costs and other operating costs and have other adverse effects eg greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation for further discussion regarding the risks to us of climate changerelated regulations policies and initiatives see the discussion below in the section entitled risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development and production of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations cash on hand and sales of noncore assets and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary commercial paper borrowings bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil ngls and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings 

similarly a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil natural gas andor ngls prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to obtain financings our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies the interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned capital expenditures and sales of assets nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered 

in addition companies in the oil and gas sector may be exposed to increasing reputational risks and in turn certain financial risks specifically certain financial institutions including certain investment advisors and sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds in response to concerns related to climate change and the requests and other influence of environmental groups and similar stakeholders have elected to shift some or all of their investments away from oil and gasrelated sectors and additional financial institutions and other investors may elect to do likewise in the future as a result fewer financial institutions and other investors may be willing to invest in and provide capital to companies in the oil and gas sector a material reduction in capital available to the oil and gas sector could make it more difficult eg due to a lack of investor interest in our equity or debt securities andor more costly eg due to higher interest rates on our debt securities or other borrowings to secure funding for our operations which in turn could adversely affect our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy and have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and operations 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological geophysical and engineering evaluation methods 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression storage and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of these factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which may be adversely impacted by bans or restrictions on drilling to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to certain considerations 

dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors board in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors including 

• cash available for dividends 

• our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations 

• our financial condition especially in relation to the anticipated future capital expenditures required to conduct our operations 

• our operating expenses 

• the levels of dividends paid by comparable companies and 

• other factors our board deems relevant 

we expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders however our board may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time including if it determines that our current or forecasted future cash flows provided by our operating activities after deducting our capital expenditures and other commitments are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all any downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

our hedging activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial basis swap price swap option swaption and collar contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts a portion of our forecasted production for 2022 is subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2022 and beyond we may be materially and adversely impacted by any declines in commodity prices which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as i the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions or ii financial operational or strategic actions taken by the customer or counterparty that adversely impact its financial condition results of operations and cash flows and in turn its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations to us furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering processing compression storage transportation export and refining facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operations 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil ngls andor natural gas reserves as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• leasehold title problems 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• adverse weather conditions such as winter storms flooding tropical storms and hurricanes and changes in weather patterns 

• compliance with or changes in including the adoption of new environmental health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions hydraulic fracturing access to and use of water disposal or other discharge eg into injection wells of produced water drilling fluids and other wastes laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil ngls and natural gas and other laws and regulations such as tax laws and regulations 

• the availability and timely issuance of required federal state tribal and other permits and licenses which may be adversely affected by among other things bans or restrictions on drilling government shutdowns or other suspensions of or delays in government services 

• the availability of costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties including mineral licenses and leases pipelines crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather process compress store transport market and export crude oil ngls and natural gas and related commodities and 

• the costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs hydraulic fracturing services pressure pumping equipment and supplies tubular materials water sand disposal facilities qualified personnel and other necessary facilities equipment materials supplies and services 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing storing transporting and exporting crude oil ngls and natural gas including the risks of 

• well blowouts and cratering 

• loss of well control 

• crude oil spills natural gas leaks formation water ie produced water spills and pipeline ruptures 

• pipe failures and casing collapses 

• uncontrollable flows of crude oil natural gas formation water or drilling fluids 

• releases of chemicals wastes or pollutants 

• adverse weather events such as winter storms flooding tropical storms and hurricanes and other natural disasters 

• fires and explosions 

• terrorism vandalism and physical electronic and cybersecurity breaches 

• formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures 

• leaks or spills in connection with or associated with the gathering processing compression storage transportation and export of crude oil ngls and natural gas and 

• malfunctions of or damage to gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

• injury or loss of life 

• damage to or destruction of property facilities equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs 

• pollution or other environmental damage 

• regulatory investigations and penalties as well as cleanup and remediation responsibilities and costs 

• suspension or interruption of our operations including due to injunction 

• repairs necessary to resume operations and 

• compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable however the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums retentions and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on economically acceptable terms 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil ngls and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities and equipment may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities and equipment including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression storage transportation refining or export facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil ngls or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are substantially dependent upon the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of our operations both during the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water including limitations resulting from natural causes such as drought could materially and adversely impact our operations further severe drought conditions can result in local water districts taking steps to restrict the use of water in their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in its operations from local sources it may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites resulting in increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties that we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil ngls or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil ngls and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 

in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further above actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and some of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil ngls and natural gas certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition from competing energy sources such as renewable energy sources 

risks related to our international operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

• increases in taxes and governmental royalties 

• changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased companies 

• loss of revenue loss of or damage to equipment property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation nationalization acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks 

• unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities 

• difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations and 

• currency restrictions or exchange rate fluctuations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties and us laws with respect to participation in boycotts that are not supported by the us government the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 eog had no net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

regulatory legislative and policy changes may materially and adversely affect the oil and gas exploration and production industry 

new or revised rules regulations and policies may be issued and new legislation may be proposed that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry such rules regulations policies and legislation may affect among other things i permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands ii the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development iii the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions andor other climate changerelated matters associated with oil and gas operations iv the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands v the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands including but not limited to an increase in applicable royalty percentages and vi us federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies 

further such regulatory legislative and policy changes may among other things result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating restrictions andor the imposition of various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations or other aspects of our business any of which could lead to operational delays increased operating and compliance costs andor other impacts on our business and operations and could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for related discussion see the below risk factors regarding legislative and regulatory matters impacting the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the discussion in item 1 business  regulation 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance andor adversely affect our business and operations and in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements and further some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations the us environmental protection agency us epa has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level 

any new requirements restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and further could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding hydraulic fracturing regulation see regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

regulations government policies and government and corporate initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a significant impact on our operations and we could incur significant cost in the future to comply 

local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the us epa’s rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions in addition our oil and gas production and processing operations are subject to the us epas new source performance standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations and gas processing plants 

at the international level in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 and to which the united states formally rejoined in february 2021 the united states has established an economywide target of reducing its net ghg emissions by 5052 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero ghg emissions economywide by no later than 2050 in addition many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord further in november 2021 the us department of the interior released its “report on the federal oil and gas leasing program” which recommended increasing royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations and government policies related to climate change and ghg emissions will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil ngls and natural gas we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations treaties or policies regarding climate change and ghg emissions including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the us but the direct and indirect costs of such developments if enacted issued or applied could materially and adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations the potential increase in the costs of our operations could include costs to operate and maintain our facilities install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances to authorize our ghg emissions pay taxes or fees related to our ghg emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program in addition changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghg emissions or restrictions on their use could also adversely affect market demand for and in turn the prices we receive for our production of crude oil ngls and natural gas further the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation see i climate change  united states under item 1 business – regulation and ii the risk factor above with respect to the new us administration 

in addition the achievement of our current or future internal initiatives relating to the reduction of ghg emissions may increase our costs including requiring us to purchase emissions credits or offsets the availability and price of which are outside of our control or may impact or otherwise limit our ability to execute on our business plans further such initiatives relating to the reduction of ghg emissions could be subject to business regulatory economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies and required advancements in technology 

tax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation while these specific changes were not included in the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law in december 2017 no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future for example by the new us administration and if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal state local or nonus taxes including the imposition of or increases in production severance or similar taxes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

in addition legislation may be proposed with respect to the enactment of a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels based on the ghg emissions associated with such fuels a carbon tax would generally increase the prices for crude oil ngls and natural gas such price increases may in turn reduce demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas and materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any proposed or enacted tax law changes but any such changes if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or enacted tax law changes to determine the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition and take appropriate actions where necessary 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor above regarding our hedging activities we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the us securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an “enduser” exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and are therefore not subject to limitation under such rule however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and are subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts lessen the number of available counterparties and in turn increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to covid19 cybersecurity and other external factors 

outbreaks of communicable diseases can adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

global or national health concerns including a widespread outbreak of contagious disease can among other impacts negatively impact the global economy reduce demand and pricing for crude oil ngls and natural gas lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of contagious disease could lead to increased volatility in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices 

for example the current pandemic involving a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus covid19 and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world resulting in an economic downturn that negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil ngls and natural gas in fact the substantial declines in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the covid19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oilexporting countries materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and other operating expenses our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock 

while the prices for crude oil ngls and natural gas have since recovered to at or above prepandemic levels if such price declines were to reoccur and continue for an extended period of time our cash flows and results of operations would be further adversely affected as could the trading price of our common stock for further discussion regarding the potential impacts on us of lower commodity prices and extended declines in commodity prices see the related discussion in the first risk factor in this section 

further if the covid19 outbreak should worsen we may also experience disruptions to commodities markets equipment supply chains and the availability of our workforce which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations in addition if the covid19 outbreak were to worsen resulting in another economic downturn our customers and other contractual parties may be unable to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us and may be unable to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes such inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the duration and severity of the outbreak the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus the development availability acceptance and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines the extent of travel restrictions business closures and other measures imposed by governmental authorities disruptions in the supply chain a prolonged delay in the resumption of operations by one or more contractual parties an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the covid19 pandemic increased logistics costs additional operating costs due to remote working arrangements adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covid19related challenges increased risk of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in remote working arrangements increased privacyrelated risks due to processing healthrelated personal information absence of employees due to illness the impact of the pandemic on eogs customers and contractual counterparties and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial to fully assess the potential impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions 

as an oil and gas producer we face various security threats including i cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to or control of our sensitive information or to render our data or systems corrupted or unusable ii threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or to the security of thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering transportation processing fractionation refining and export facilities and iii threats from terrorist acts the potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems including internally developed software data hosting platforms realtime data acquisition systems thirdparty software cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms to i estimate our oil and gas reserves ii process and record financial and operating data iii process and analyze all stages of our business operations including exploration drilling completions production transportation pipelines and other related activities and iv communicate with our employees and vendors suppliers and other third parties further our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of personal devices remote communications and other workfromhome practices in response to the covid19 pandemic although we have implemented and invested in and will continue to implement and invest in controls procedures and protections including internal and external personnel that are designed to protect our systems identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective 

our systems and networks and those of our business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks including without limitation denialofservice attacks malicious software data privacy breaches by employees insiders or others with authorized access cyber or phishingattacks ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems and other electronic security breaches if any of these security breaches were to occur we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations including our drilling completion production and corporate functions which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

• unauthorized access to and release of our business data reserves information strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies 

• data corruption communication interruption or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident 

• data corruption or operational disruptions of our productionrelated infrastructure which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges 

• unauthorized access to and release of personal information of our royalty owners employees and vendors which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information 

• a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations 

• a cybersecurity attack on thirdparty gathering transportation processing fractionation refining or export facilities which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production in either case resulting in a loss of revenues 

• a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities resulting in a loss of revenues 

• a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of noncompliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties 

• a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues and 

• a cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards 

further strategic targets such as energyrelated assets may be at a greater risk of terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the united states moreover external digital technologies control nearly all of the crude oil and natural gas distribution and refining systems in the us and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production a cybersecurity attack directed at for example crude oil and natural gas distribution systems could i damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment ii disrupt energy supplies and markets by delaying or preventing delivery of production to markets and iii make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions 

any such terrorist attack or cybersecurity attack that affects us our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business andor energyrelated assets could have a material adverse effect on our business including disruption of our operations damage to our reputation a loss of counterparty trust reimbursement or other costs increased compliance costs significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines penalties or intervention although we have business continuity plans in place our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and the infrastructure that supports our business while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts further our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

while we have experienced limited cybersecurity incidents in the past we have not had to date any business interruptions or material losses from breaches of cybersecurity however there is no assurance that we will not suffer any such interruptions or losses in the future further as technologies evolve and cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated we are continually expending additional resources to modify or enhance our security measures to protect against such threats and to identify and remediate on a regular basis any vulnerabilities in our information systems and related infrastructure that may be detected and these expenditures in the future may be significant additionally the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters including increased regulatory focus on prevention which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks including cyberrelated attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has from time to time issued public warnings that indicate that energyrelated assets such as transportation and refining facilities might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 

any such actions and the threat of such actions including any resulting political instability or societal disruption could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including but not limited to the disruption of energy supplies and markets the reduction of overall demand for crude oil and natural gas increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the facilities and other infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities that we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production during that season 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events changes in temperature and precipitation patterns changes to ground and surface water availability and other related phenomena which could affect some or all of our operations our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events such as winter storms flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression storage transportation andor export facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression storage and transportation services and export services such extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered further the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced future production is therefore highly dependent upon the level of success of these activities for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage the following table summarizes eogs gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2021 in thousands excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three to five years approximately 02 million net acres will expire in 2022 01 million net acres will expire in 2023 and 01 million net acres will expire in 2024 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions as of december 31 2021 there were no proved undeveloped reserves puds associated with such undeveloped acreage in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future 

many of our oil and gas leases are large enough to accommodate more than one producing unit included in our undeveloped acreage is nonproducing acreage within such larger producing leases 

acreage associated with eogs exploration program in oman was reduced as of december 31 2021 due to eog contractually agreeing with its partner in block 49 to withdraw additionally eog does not intend to proceed with additional work commitments and therefore anticipates relinquishing its block 36 acreage in the third quarter of 2022 

the agreement governing the acreage associated with our exploration program in offshore australia is set to expire at various dates through 2025 depending on eogs decision to move forward with its defined work program or unless eog is granted a production license

commodity prices in 2020 the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to address and limit the spread of the virus adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world resulting in an economic downturn beginning in early 2020 that negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in response opec a consortium of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries and certain nonopec global producers russia kazakhstan and others agreed to voluntarily curtail crude oil supplies beginning in april 2020 with a schedule to bring back some of these curtailments through april 2021 certain other nonopec countries also curtailed production andor reduced investments in existing and new crude oil projects this response started the process of balancing supply with demand 

in 2021 the effects of global covid19 mitigation efforts including extensive global fiscal stimulus and the availability of vaccines tempered by new covid19 variant strains and corresponding containment measures in certain parts of the world have resulted in overall increased demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas see item 1a risk factors for discussion of risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

during 2021 and into early 2022 opec continued their schedule of gradually returning all curtailed production through 2022 in response to expected increases in demand for crude oil the continuing rebalancing of crude oil demand and supply resulting from improving or stabilizing conditions in certain economies and financial markets of the world combined with the continuing actions taken by opec had a positive impact on crude oil prices in 2021 prices for crude oil and condensate and ngls returned to prepandemic levels in the first quarter of 2021 while natural gas prices returned to prepandemic levels at the beginning of 2021 

as a result of the many uncertainties associated with i the world economic and political environment ii the covid19 pandemic and its continuing effect on the economies and financial markets of the world and iii any future actions by the members of opec and the effect of these uncertainties on worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices in the future however prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas have historically been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

eog will continue to monitor future market conditions and adjust its capital allocation strategy and production outlook accordingly in order to maximize shareholder value while maintaining its strong financial position 

climate change  for a discussion of climate change matters and related regulatory matters including potential developments related to climate change and the potential impacts and risks of such developments on eog see item 1a risk factors and the related discussion in item 1 business – regulation eog will continue to monitor and assess any climate changerelated developments that could impact eog and the oil and gas industry to determine the impact on its business and operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2021 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

during 2021 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years such efficiencies resulted in lower operating drilling and completion costs in 2021 in addition eog continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins exchanges or tactical acquisitions on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 75 and 76 of united states production during 2021 and 2020 respectively during 2021 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the delaware basin play eagle ford oil play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in texas and new mexico eog faced interruptions to sales in certain markets due to disruptions throughout the united states from winter storm uri in the first quarter of 2021 winter storm uri also negatively impacted lease and well transportation and gathering and processing costs in the first quarter of 2021 see item 1 business  exploration and production for further discussion regarding eogs 2021 united states operations 

trinidad in the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad eog continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium block modified ua block block 4a modified ub block the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to heritage petroleum company limited heritage 

in march 2021 eog signed a farmout agreement with heritage which allows eog to earn a 65 working interest in a portion of the contract area eog area governed by the trinidad northern area license the eog area is located offshore the southwest coast of trinidad eog continues to make progress on the design and fabrication of a platform and related facilities for its previously announced discovery in the modified ua block 

in 2022 eog expects to drill one net exploratory well in the eog area in addition to three development wells and one exploratory well in the modified ua block 

other international in australia on april 22 2021 a subsidiary of eog entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a 100 interest in the wa488p block located offshore western australia the transaction was closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 including the transfer of the petroleum exploration permit for that block in 2022 eog will continue preparing for the drilling of an exploration well which is expected to commence in 2023 

in the sultanate of oman oman a royal decree was issued on march 9 2021 and eog became a participant in the exploration and production sharing agreement for block 49 holding a 50 working interest eogs partner in block 49 completed the drilling and testing of one net exploratory well which was determined to be a dry hole eog notified its partner and the ministry of energy and minerals of its intention to withdraw from block 49 in block 36 where eog holds a 100 working interest eog drilled two net exploratory wells and completed one net exploratory well there was a discovery of natural gas in block 36 but the well results did not yield sufficient projected returns for eog to move forward with the project eog recorded pretax impairment charges of 45 million and dry hole costs of 42 million in 2021 in 2022 eog expects to exit block 36 

in may 2021 eog closed the sale of its subsidiary which held all of its assets in the china sichuan basin china net production was approximately 25 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas prior to the sale eog no longer has any operations or assets in china 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 at december 31 2021 and 22 at december 31 2020 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on february 1 2021 eog repaid upon maturity the 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4100 senior notes due 2021 2021 notes 

during 2021 eog funded 41 billion 124 million of which was noncash in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations paid 2684 million in dividends to common stockholders and repaid the 2021 notes primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of 231 million from the sale of assets 

total anticipated 2022 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 43 billion to 47 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash transactions the majority of 2022 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings 

management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities 

dividend declarations and share repurchase authorization on february 25 2021 eogs board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous 0375 per share to 04125 per share effective beginning with the dividend paid on april 30 2021 to stockholders of record as of april 16 2021 

on may 6 2021 eogs board declared a special cash dividend on the common stock of 100 per share the special cash dividend which was in addition to the quarterly cash dividend was paid on july 30 2021 to stockholders of record as of july 16 2021 

on november 4 2021 eogs board i further increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous 04125 per share to 075 per share effective beginning with the dividend paid on january 28 2022 to stockholders of record as of january 14 2022 ii declared a special cash dividend on the common stock of 200 per share paid on december 30 2021 to stockholders of record as of december 15 2021 iii established a new share repurchase authorization to allow for the repurchase by eog of up to 5 billion of the common stock and iv revoked and terminated the share repurchase authorization established by the board in september 2001 see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional discussion 

on february 24 2022 the board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of 075 per share payable april 29 2022 to stockholders of record as of april 15 2022 the board also declared a special dividend of 100 per share payable march 29 2022 to stockholders of record as of march 15 2022 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

operating revenues and other 

during 2021 operating revenues increased 7610 million or 69 to 18642 million from 11032 million in 2020 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas increased 8090 million or 111 to 15381 million in 2021 from 7291 million in 2020 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2021 were approximately 84 of total wellhead revenues compared to 89 in 2020 during 2021 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1152 million compared to net gains of 1145 million in 2020 gathering processing and marketing revenues increased 1705 million during 2021 to 4288 million from 2583 million in 2020 eog recognized net gains on asset dispositions of 17 million in 2021 compared to net losses on asset dispositions of 47 million in 2020 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 





1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

2 other international includes eogs china and canada operations the china operations were sold in the second quarter of 2021 

3 dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet as applicable excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent as applicable includes crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas mmboe is calculated by multiplying the mboed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand 

2021 compared to 2020 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2021 increased 5339 million or 92 to 11125 million from 5786 million in 2020 due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 4852 million and an increase in production 487 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2021 increased 77 to 6850 per barrel compared to 3863 per barrel in 2020 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2021 increased 9 to 445 mbbld as compared to 409 mbbld in 2020 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin partially offset by decreased production in the eagle ford oil play 

ngls revenues in 2021 increased 1144 million or 171 to 1812 million from 668 million in 2020 primarily due to a higher composite average wellhead ngls price 1104 million and an increase in production 40 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price increased 156 to 3435 per barrel in 2021 compared to 1341 per barrel in 2020 ngl production in 2021 increased 6 to 145 mbbld as compared to 136 mbbld in 2020 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2021 increased 1607 million or 192 to 2444 million from 837 million in 2020 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price 1486 million and an increase in natural gas deliveries 121 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 155 to 466 per mcf in 2021 compared to 183 per mcf in 2020 natural gas deliveries in 2021 increased 15 to 1436 mmcfd as compared to 1252 mmcfd in 2020 the increase in production was primarily due to increased production of associated natural gas from the permian basin and higher natural gas volumes in trinidad partially offset by lower natural gas volumes associated with the dispositions of the marcellus shale assets in the third quarter of 2020 and the china assets in the second quarter of 2021 

during 2021 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1152 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil ngl and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 638 million during 2020 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1145 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil ngl and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 1071 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm capacity at thirdparty facilities with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities eog sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations marketing costs represent the costs to purchase thirdparty crude oil natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2021 increased 230 million compared to 2020 primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate and natural gas marketing activities the margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and eogs decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling may and june 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements 

2020 compared to 2019 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2020 decreased 3827 million or 40 to 5786 million from 9613 million in 2019 due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 2860 million and a decrease in production 967 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2020 decreased 33 to 3863 per barrel compared to 5772 per barrel in 2019 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2020 decreased 10 to 409 mbbld as compared to 456 mbbld in 2019 the decreased production was primarily in the eagle ford oil play and the rocky mountain area partially offset by increased production in the permian basin 

ngls revenues in 2020 decreased 116 million or 15 to 668 million from 784 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead ngls price 130 million partially offset by an increase in production 13 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price decreased 16 to 1341 per barrel in 2020 compared to 1603 per barrel in 2019 ngl production in 2020 increased 1 to 136 mbbld as compared to 134 mbbld in 2019 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin partially offset by decreased production of associated ngls in the eagle ford oil play 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2020 decreased 347 million or 29 to 837 million from 1184 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 251 million and a decrease in natural gas deliveries 96 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 23 to 183 per mcf in 2020 compared to 238 per mcf in 2019 natural gas deliveries in 2020 decreased 8 to 1252 mmcfd as compared to 1366 mmcfd in 2019 the decrease in production was primarily due to lower natural gas volumes in trinidad the marcellus shale and the rocky mountain area partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the permian basin 

during 2020 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1145 million which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil ngl and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 1071 million during 2019 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 180 million which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 231 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2020 decreased 124 million compared to 2019 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities the margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and eogs decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling may and june 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements 

operating and other expenses 

2021 compared to 2020  during 2021 operating expenses of 12540 million were 964 million higher than the 11576 million incurred during 2020   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 





1 total excludes exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs gathering and processing costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2021 compared to 2020 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1135 million in 2021 increased 72 million from 1063 million in 2020 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the united states 33 million and in trinidad 5 million higher workovers expenditures in the united states 25 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 12 million partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in canada 6 million and as a result of the disposition of all of the china assets in the second quarter of 2021 5 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting from increased production 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on eogs gathering system to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees storage and terminal fees the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements the cost of dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 863 million in 2021 increased 128 million from 735 million in 2020 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the permian basin 121 million and the rocky mountain area 22 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the eagle ford oil play 13 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain ngls fractionation fees paid to third parties eog pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract ngls 

gathering and processing costs increased 100 million to 559 million in 2021 compared to 459 million in 2020 primarily due to increased gathering and processing fees related to production from the permian basin 51 million and the rocky mountain area 10 million increased operating costs in the permian basin 26 million and the rocky mountain area 7 million and increased administrative expenses in the united states 15 million partially offset by decreased gathering and processing fees in the eagle ford oil play 5 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2021 increased 251 million to 3651 million from 3400 million in 2020 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2021 were 235 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in production in the united states 307 million and trinidad 12 million and higher unit rates in trinidad 14 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 85 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment in 2021 were 15 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in expense related to storage assets 

ga expenses of 511 million in 2021 increased 27 million from 484 million in 2020 primarily due to a net increase in costs associated with corporate support activities including employeerelated expenses and increased information system costs 54 million partially offset by a decrease in idle equipment and termination fees 46 million 

net interest expense of 178 million in 2021 was 27 million lower than 2020 primarily due to repayment in february 2021 of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4100 senior notes due 2021 29 million repayment in june 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 440 senior notes due 2020 9 million repayment in april 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 245 senior notes due 2020 3 million and lower interest payments for late royalty payments on oklahoma properties 6 million partially offset by the issuance in april 2020 of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4950 senior notes due 2050 11 million and 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2030 10 million 

exploration costs of 154 million in 2021 increased 8 million from 146 million in 2020 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions 



impairments of proved properties in 2020 were primarily due to the decline in commodity prices and were primarily related to the writedown to fair value of legacy and noncore natural gas crude oil and combo plays in the united states impairments of unproved oil and gas properties included charges of 38 million in 2021 due to the decision in the fourth quarter of 2021 to exit block 36 and block 49 in oman and 252 million in 2020 for certain leasehold costs that are no longer expected to be developed before expiration impairments of other assets in 2020 were primarily for the writedown to fair value of sand and crudebyrail assets and a commodity pricerelated writedown of other assets impairments of firm commitment contracts in 2020 were a result of the decision to exit the horn river basin in canada 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2021 increased 569 million to 1047 million 68 of wellhead revenues from 478 million 66 of wellhead revenues in 2020 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 522 million increased severanceproduction taxes in trinidad 7 million and decreased state severance tax refunds 39 million 

eog recognized an income tax provision of 1269 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of 134 million in 2020 primarily due to increased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2021 increased to 21 from 18 in 2020 the higher effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to eogs foreign operations and stockbased compensation tax deficiencies increasing the effective tax rate on pretax income in 2021 and decreasing the effective tax rate on pretax loss in 2020 

2020 compared to 2019  during 2020 operating expenses of 11576 million were 2105 million lower than the 13681 million incurred during 2019   the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 





1 total excludes exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs gathering and processing costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1063 million in 2020 decreased 304 million from 1367 million in 2019 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states 157 million and in canada 25 million lower workovers expenditures in the united states 103 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 12 million lease and well expenses decreased in the united states primarily due to decreased operating activities resulting from decreased production efficiency improvements and service cost reductions 

transportation costs of 735 million in 2020 decreased 23 million from 758 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale 27 million the rocky mountain area 24 million and the eagle ford oil play 20 million partially offset by increased transportation costs in the permian basin 56 million 

gathering and processing costs decreased 20 million to 459 million in 2020 compared to 479 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased operating costs in the eagle ford 16 million and decreased gathering and processing fees in the eagle ford oil play 9 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale 5 million partially offset by increased gathering and processing fees in the permian basin 15 million 

dda expenses in 2020 decreased 350 million to 3400 million from 3750 million in 2019 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2020 were 390 million lower than in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in production in the united states 222 million and trinidad 22 million and lower unit rates in the united states 150 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment in 2020 were 40 million higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in expense related to gathering and storage assets and equipment 

ga expenses of 484 million in 2020 decreased 5 million from 489 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased employeerelated expenses 43 million and professional and other services 7 million partially offset by idle equipment and termination fees 46 million 

net interest expense of 205 million in 2020 was 20 million higher than 2019 primarily due to the issuance of the notes in april 2020 51 million and lower capitalized interest 7 million partially offset by repayment in june 2019 of the 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 21 million repayment in june 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 440 senior notes due 2020 13 million and repayment in april 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 245 senior notes due 2020 10 million 

exploration costs of 146 million in 2020 increased 6 million from 140 million in 2019 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 15 million partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses in the united states 8 million 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy and noncore natural gas and crude oil and combo plays in 2020 and legacy natural gas assets in 2019 

taxes other than income in 2020 decreased 322 million to 478 million 66 of wellhead revenues from 800 million 69 of wellhead revenues in 2019 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 232 million decreased ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 51 million and a state severance tax refund 27 million 

other income net was 10 million in 2020 compared to other income net of 31 million in 2019 the decrease of 21 million in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income 

in response to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the president of the united states signed the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act into law on march 27 2020 the cares act provides economic support to individuals and businesses through enhanced loan programs expanded unemployment benefits and certain payroll and income tax relief among other provisions the primary tax benefit of the cares act for eog was the acceleration of approximately 150 million of additional refundable alternative minimum tax amt credits into tax year 2019 these credits originated from amt paid by eog in years prior to 2018 and were reflected as a deferred tax asset and a noncurrent receivable as of december 31 2019 since they had been expected to either offset future current tax liabilities or be refunded on a declining balance schedule through 2021 the 150 million of additional refundable amt credits was received in july 2020 

further pandemic relief was contained in the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 the ca act which was signed into law by the president of the united states on december 27 2020 in addition the ca act provided government funding and limited corporate income tax relief primarily related to making permanent or extending certain tax provisions none of which were a material benefit for eog 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 134 million in 2020 compared to an income tax provision of 810 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 18 from 23 in 2019 the lower effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to eogs foreign operations and increased stockbased compensation tax deficiencies 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash flow 

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 were funds generated from operations net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts and proceeds from asset sales the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures dividend payments to stockholders repayments of debt net cash paid for settlements of commodity derivative contracts and other property plant and equipment expenditures 

2021 compared to 2020   net cash provided by operating activities of 8791 million in 2021 increased 3783 million from 5008 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in wellhead revenues 8090 million and an increase in gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs 230 million partially offset by an increase in net cash paid for settlements of commodity derivative contracts 1709 million an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 1320 million net cash used in working capital in 2021 817 million compared to net cash provided by working capital in 2020 193 million and an increase in cash operating expenses 882 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 3419 million in 2021 increased by 71 million from 3348 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties 394 million partially offset by net cash provided by working capital associated with investing activities in 2021 200 million compared to net cash used in working capital associated with investing activities in 2020 75 million an increase in proceeds from the sales of assets 39 million and a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 9 million 

net cash used in financing activities of 3493 million in 2021 included cash dividend payments 2684 million repayments of longterm debt 750 million purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans 41 million and repayment of finance lease liabilities 37 million cash provided by financing activities in 2021 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity 19 million 

2020 compared to 2019 net cash provided by operating activities of 5008 million in 2020 decreased 3155 million from 8163 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues 4291 million unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 166 million a decrease in gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs 123 million and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 86 million partially offset by an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts 840 million and a decrease in cash operating expenses 641 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 3348 million in 2020 decreased by 2829 million from 6177 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties 2908 million an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets 52 million a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 49 million and a decrease in other investing activities 10 million partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital associated with investing activities 190 million

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in millions 





1 leasehold acquisitions included 45 million 197 million and 98 million related to noncash property exchanges in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 property acquisitions included 5 million 15 million and 52 million related to noncash property exchanges in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

3 other property plant and equipment included noncash additions of 74 million and 174 million primarily related to finance lease transactions for storage facilities in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

exploration and development expenditures of 3842 million for 2021 were 241 million higher than the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states 267 million and increased facilities expenditures 58 million partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in trinidad 61 million decreased leasehold acquisitions 50 million and decreased property acquisitions 35 million the 2021 exploration and development expenditures of 3842 million included 3172 million in development drilling and facilities 537 million in exploration 100 million in property acquisitions and 33 million in capitalized interest the 2020 exploration and development expenditures of 3601 million included 2905 million in development drilling and facilities 530 million in exploration 135 million in property acquisitions and 31 million in capitalized interest the 2019 exploration and development expenditures of 6442 million included 5513 million in development drilling and facilities 511 million in exploration 380 million in property acquisitions and 38 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors eog believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 

commodity derivative transactions 

presented below is a comprehensive summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts settled during the year ended december 31 2021 closed and remaining for 2022 and thereafter as of february 18 2022 crude oil and ngl volumes are presented in mbbld and prices are presented in bbl natural gas volumes are presented in mmbtu per day mmbtud and prices are presented in dollars per mmbtu mmbtu

in connection with its financial commodity derivative contracts eog had 14 billion of collateral posted at february 18 2022 eog expects this collateral to be applied to the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts if market prices remain above contract prices or returned to eog if market prices decrease below contract prices 

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 at december 31 2021 compared to 22 at december 31 2020 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively eog had outstanding 4890 million and 5640 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of 5577 million and 6505 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2021 eog funded its capital program and operations primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales while eog maintains a 20 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2021 and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero eog considers the availability of its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility as described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2021 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad australia oman canada and through may 2021 in china eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world economic and political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the availabilities of other energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2022 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 18 2022 the average 2022 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 8445 per barrel and 461 per mmbtu respectively representing an increase of 24 for crude oil and an increase of 20 for natural gas from the average nymex prices in 2021 see item 1a risk factors for additional discussion of the impact of commodity prices including fluctuations in commodity prices on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

including the impact of eogs crude oil and ngl derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2022 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 107 million for net income and 138 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2022 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 15 million for net income and 19 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil ngls and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2022 see commodity derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states drilling activity in its delaware basin eagle ford oil play rocky mountain area and dorado gas play where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and offset inflationary pressure through efficiency gains and by locking in certain service costs for drilling and completion activities in addition eog expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2022 capital expenditures on leasing acreage evaluating new prospects longterm transportation infrastructure and environmental projects 

  

the total anticipated 2022 capital expenditures of approximately 43 billion to 47 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash transactions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2022 total crude oil ngls and natural gas production is expected to return to prepandemic levels in 2022 eog expects to continue to focus on mitigating inflationary pressure on operating costs through efficiency improvements 

cash requirements certain of eogs capital expenditures and operating expenses are subject to contracts with minimum commitments including those that meet the definition of a lease under asu 201602 in 2022 eog anticipates the following cash requirements under these commitments in millions 





1 for more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under asu 201602 see note 18 to consolidated financial statements 

2 amounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars into united states dollars at december 31 2021 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 

3 for more information on transportation and storage service commitments and purchase and service obligations see note 8 to consolidated financial statements 

in 2022 eog has no senior notes maturing and expects to pay interest of 191 million on senior notes for more information on eogs current and longterm debt see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

cash requirements to settle the liability for unrecognized tax benefits eogs pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the liability for dismantlement abandonment and asset retirement obligations see notes 6 7 and 15 respectively to consolidated financial statements are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown 

eog expects to fund its exploration development and exploitation activities and other cash requirements both in 2022 and in future years primarily from internally generated cash flows and cash on hand as discussed above eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies and estimates as critical based on among other things their impact on eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies and estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies and estimates following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies and estimates 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 

the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration and development costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 

costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are expensed as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves if commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the concept of sufficient progress is subject to significant judgment and may require further operational actions or require additional approvals from government agencies or partners in oil and gas operations among other factors the timing of which may delay managements determinations see note 16 to consolidated financial statements 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves are revised upward or downward earnings will increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2021 wti crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 3698 per barrel to 8564 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 133 per mmbtu to 2386 per mmbtu market prices for ngls are influenced by the components extracted including ethane propane butane and natural gasoline among others and the respective market pricing for each component 

eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas and the fiveyear oil price information services futures strip for ngls components in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if any combination of crude oil prices ngls prices natural gas prices or estimated proved reserves diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary 

see notes 13 and 14 to consolidated financial statements for further disclosures of impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances see note 6 to consolidated financial statements

 item 1 business 

general 

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the peoples republic of china china the sultanate of oman oman and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10‑q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports including related exhibits and supplemental schedules filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is wwweogresourcescom information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this report 

at december 31 2020 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 3220 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1514 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 813 mmbbl were ngls reserves and 5360 billion cubic feet bcf or 893 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 98 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 1 in trinidad and 1 in other international areas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

eogs operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related for information regarding the risks associated with eogs domestic and foreign operations see item 1a risk factors 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet eog is focused on innovation and costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drilling equipment and completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks and costs associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance is integral in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are located in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2020 on a crude oil equivalent basis 48 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 26 were ngls and 26 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio 

the following is a summary of significant developments during 2020 and anticipated 2021 plans for certain areas of eogs united states operations 





1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

the south texas area includes our eagle ford play and our newly announced dorado gas play eog holds approximately 516000 total net acres in the prolific oil window of the eagle ford and approximately 163000 net acres in the dorado prospect area during the second and third quarters of 2020 eog significantly curtailed its eagle ford oil production due to low crude oil prices operations in the eagle ford returned to normal by the end of the third quarter of 2020 in the dorado play with the onset of the pandemic and resulting market downturn eog elected to defer its 2020 drilling program and instead focus on gathering and analyzing data regarding the production performance of its 2019 dorado drilling program in 2020 eog completed 213 net eagle ford wells and late in 2020 acquired and completed one net dorado well to further delineate the play in 2021 eog expects to complete approximately 145 net eagle ford wells and to drill and complete approximately 15 net dorado wells 

in the delaware basin eog completed 247 net wells during 2020 primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp bone spring and leonard plays the delaware basin consists of approximately 4800 feet of oil rich stacked pay potential offering eog multiple codevelopment opportunities throughout its 404000 total net acreage position 

in the delaware basin upper wolfcamp play eog has approximately 226000 net acres and completed 166 net wells in 2020 eog continued its upper wolfcamp development plan with well spacing as close as 500 feet in the crude oil portion of the play and 880 feet in the combination crude oil and natural gas portion in addition to the upper wolfcamp eog completed 7 net wells in 2020 in the newly announced middle wolfcamp play and has identified 193000 net prospective acres continued improvement and excellent results in the delaware basin wolfcamp program were supported by optimized well spacing enhanced well completions precision drilling and continued cost reductions moving forward into 2021 the delaware basin wolfcamp play will continue to be a primary area of focus 

in the bone spring play eog has three main subplays the first second and third bone spring in 2020 eog completed 56 total net bone spring wells within the three subplays on its combined 289000 net prospective acres of the three subplays the second bone spring had the majority of the activity in 2020 with eog completing 42 net wells the bone spring plays continue to be an integral part of eog’s delaware basin plans and portfolio 

in the leonard play eog holds approximately 160000 net acres and maintained its development plan with 18 net wells completed in 2020 with a strategy of developing deeper targets first while simultaneously collecting data from the shallow targets the leonard play will progressively become a more active part of eog’s program 

activity in 2021 will remain focused on the delaware basin wolfcamp bone spring and leonard plays where eog expects to complete approximately 275 net wells 

activity in the rocky mountain area in 2020 was focused on the wyoming powder river basin in the powder river basin eog operated a onerig program and completed 35 net wells in the niobrara mowry turner and parkman formations in addition key infrastructure was added in order to lower operating costs and increase price realizations going forward in the dj basin eog operated one rig for a partial year and completed 17 net wells in both the codell and the niobrara formations activity in the dj basin is expected to be minimal in 2021 as development continues to shift to the powder river basin in the williston basin eog completed 3 net wells in the bakken and three forks in 2020 production in the rocky mountain area and williston basin was significantly curtailed primarily in the second quarter in response to crude oil price declines but has subsequently returned to normal levels in 2021 activity will be focused on development in the powder river basin with plans to complete approximately 45 net wells eog currently holds approximately 12 million net acres in the rocky mountain area 

in the midcontinent area eog continued its development of the woodford oil window play with 15 net wells completed during 2020 eog holds approximately 37000 net acres in the play and plans to have minimal activity in 2021 

operations outside the united states 

eog has operations offshore trinidad in the china sichuan basin oman and in canada and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas 

trinidad eog through its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited holds interests in i the exploration and production licenses covering the south east coast consortium secc block pelican and banyan fields sercan area and each of their related facilities and the ska mento reggae and deep teak saaman and poui areas all of which are offshore trinidad and ii a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for each of the modified ua modified ub and 4a blocks 

several fields in the secc modified ua modified ub and 4a blocks banyan field and sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate 

in 2020 eogs net production averaged approximately 180 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 10 mbbld of crude oil and condensate in 2020 eog drilled three net wells and completed two net wells the remaining net well made a discovery that is being evaluated all wells discovered commercially economic reserves 

in 2021 eog expects to focus on the design and fabrication of the platform and related infrastructure for the previously announced discovery made in the modified ua block in addition eog expects to continue its exploration program 

china  since 2008 eog has been developing the baijaochang field in the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china with its partner petrochina under a production sharing contract in 2020 eogs net production averaged approximately 26 mmcfd of natural gas eog continues to work with petrochina to ensure uninterrupted production 

oman  in september 2020 eog reached an agreement with apex oman block 36 inc to acquire its entire interest in block 36 in oman the royal decree was issued on october 28 2020 at which point eog became the operator and held all rights under the exploration and production sharing agreement for block 36 additionally in december 2020 the ministry of energy and minerals for oman approved the assignment of block 49 to eog pursuant to the terms of the farmin agreement with tethys oil montasar limited in accordance with the terms of the farmin agreement eog participated in the drilling of an exploratory well which was in progress at december 31 2020 in 2021 eog expects to drill two net exploration wells in block 36 

canada eog maintains approximately 47000 net acres in the horn river area in northeast british columbia in march 2020 eog began the process of exiting its canada operations 

marketing 

in 2020 eog continued its diversified approach to marketing its wellhead crude oil and condensate production the majority of eogs united states wellhead crude oil and condensate production was transported by pipeline to downstream markets with the remainder sold into local markets major us sales areas accessed by eog were at various locations along the us gulf coast including houston and corpus christi texas cushing oklahoma the permian basin and the midwest in 2020 eog also sold crude oil at the houston ship channel and the port of corpus christi for export to foreign destinations in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location in 2021 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same at december 31 2020 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of crude oil of 8 mmbbls in 2021 all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

in 2020 eog processed certain of its united states wellhead natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices into either local markets or downstream locations in certain instances eog exchanged its ngl production for purity products received downstream which were sold at prevailing market prices in 2021 such pricing mechanisms are expected to remain the same 

in 2020 consistent with its diversified marketing strategy the majority of eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was transported by pipeline to various locations including katy texas east texas the agua dulce hub in south texas the cheyenne hub in weld county colorado southern california and chicago illinois remaining natural gas production was sold into local markets in each case pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point in 2021 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same additionally eog sells natural gas to a liquefied natural gas liquefaction facility near corpus christi texas and receives pricing based on the platts japan korea marker at december 31 2020 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of natural gas of 170 bcf in 2021 105 bcf in 2022 91 bcf in 2023 94 bcf in 2024 81 bcf in 2025 and 1609 bcf thereafter all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

in 2020 a majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices or under a fixed price contract in 2021 natural gas volumes from trinidad will be sold under a fixed price contract ending in 2026 

in 2020 all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2021 

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2020 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues the three purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations for wellhead volumes on a perday basis

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil ngls and natural gas certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition from competing energy sources such as renewable energy sources see item 1a risk factors 

regulation 

2020 election  in november 2020 joseph r biden jr was elected president of the united states new or revised rules regulations and policies may be issued and new legislation may be proposed during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry such rules regulations policies and legislation may affect among other things i permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands ii the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development iii the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions andor other climate changerelated matters associated with oil and gas operations iv the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands v the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and vi us federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies see the below discussion and item 1a risk factors for additional information 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests on federal lands further on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to among other things pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices any limitation or ban on permitting for oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands could have a material and adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the fort worth basin barnett shale in north texas the williston basin bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2020 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and other federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation generally  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act further the us epa in may 2016 issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds voc from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in september 2020 the us epa issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segment from the 2016 new source performance standards rescinded voc and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the us epas 2016 standards and its september 2020 final rule notwithstanding the current court challenges the us epa under the biden administration may reconsider the september 2020 final rule which could result in more stringent methane emission rulemaking 

at the international level the us in december 2015 participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 while the us withdrew from the paris agreement on november 4 2020 president biden issued an executive order on january 20 2021 recommitting the united states to the paris agreement in addition many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord further on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to among other things consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 as amended 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations treaties or policies regarding climate change and ghg emissions including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the us by the new administration but the direct and indirect costs of such developments if enacted issued or applied could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations further the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states substantially all of the onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa has also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in september 2020 the us epa issued amendments to the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards which removed the transmission and storage segment from the new source performance standards rescinded voc and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments 

from time to time there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level in addition there were proposals and positions taken by president biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters further on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to among other things pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices 

in addition to the abovedescribed federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements operating restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with laws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however eog is unable to predict i the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states or other aspects of our operations and ii the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations relating to such future laws and regulations the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad china and canada and an exploration program in oman eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations outside the united states associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas outside the united states where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas during the last three years average united states commodity prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 33 in 2020 and 11 in 2019 and increased 28 in 2018 each as compared to the immediately preceding year eogs quarterly price realizations ranged from 2040 per barrel to 4697 per barrel in 2020 average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 16 in 2020 and 40 in 2019 and increased 18 in 2018 each as compared to the immediately preceding year these fluctuations resulted in a 27 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2020 a 23 decrease in 2019 and a 31 increase inclusive of a positive revenue adjustment of 044 per mcf related to the adoption of accounting standards update 201409 in 2018 each as compared to the immediately preceding year 

due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries and the duration and impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the global supply of and demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in the prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs crude oil and ngl derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2021 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 99 million for net income and 127 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2021 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 31 million for net income and 40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2021 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  commodity derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2021 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ‑ capital resources and liquidity  commodity derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil ngl and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil ngl and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes flooding and other adverse weather events moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce eogs revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise “we” “us” “our” and “eog” refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

risks related to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

• domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil ngls and natural gas 

• domestic and international drilling activity 

• the actions of other crude oil producing and exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries 

• consumer and industrialcommercial demand for crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• worldwide economic conditions geopolitical factors and political conditions including but not limited to the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics pandemics or other public health issues such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation gathering processing compression storage and refining facilities 

• the price and availability of and demand for competing energy sources including alternative energy sources 

• the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures alternative fuel requirements and climate changerelated initiatives 

• the nature and extent of governmental regulation including any changes or other actions which may result from the recent elections in the united states of america united states or us and change in administration and including environmental and other climate changerelated regulation regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil ngls and natural gas and related commodities 

• the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including trading by commodity price speculators and others and 

• weather conditions and changes in weather patterns 

in the first half of 2020 the prices for crude oil ngls and natural gas declined substantially as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the covid19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oilexporting countries in the second half of 2020 i the prices for ngls and natural gas recovered to prepandemic levels and ii the prices for crude oil increased but remain significantly below prepandemic levels 

the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict crude oil ngls and natural gas prices in 2021 and thereafter as a result there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil ngls andor natural gas will continue to increase from or sustain their current levels nor can there be any assurance that the prices for crude oil ngls andor natural gas will not again decline 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and operating expenses the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and also possibly shut in or plug and abandon certain wells in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which would require us to write down the value of our properties such reserve writedowns and asset impairments can materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in fact the substantial declines in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and operating expenses our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock such commodity price declines also resulted in aggregate impairment charges of approximately 18 billion in the first half of 2020 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 278 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at december 31 2020 

if commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time our financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock in addition we may be required to incur additional impairment charges andor make additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations and sales of noncore assets and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary commercial paper borrowings bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil ngls and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings 

similarly a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil natural gas andor ngls prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to obtain financings our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies the interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned capital expenditures and sales of assets nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological geophysical and engineering evaluation methods 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression storage and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of these factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which may be adversely impacted by bans or restrictions on drilling to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

our hedging activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial basis swap price swap option swaption and collar contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts a portion of our forecasted production for 2021 and 2022 is subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2021 2022 and beyond we may be materially and adversely impacted by any declines in commodity prices which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering processing compression storage transportation and refining facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operations 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil ngls andor natural gas reserves as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• title problems 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• adverse weather conditions such as winter storms flooding tropical storms and hurricanes and changes in weather patterns 

• compliance with or changes in including the adoption of new environmental health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions hydraulic fracturing access to and use of water disposal or other discharge eg into injection wells of produced water drilling fluids and other wastes laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas and other laws and regulations such as tax laws and regulations 

• the availability and timely issuance of required federal state tribal and other permits and licenses which may be adversely affected by among other things bans or restrictions on drilling government shutdowns or other suspensions of or delays in government services 

• the availability of costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties including mineral licenses and leases pipelines crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather process compress store transport market and export crude oil natural gas and related commodities and 

• the costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs hydraulic fracturing services pressure pumping equipment and supplies tubular materials water sand disposal facilities qualified personnel and other necessary facilities equipment materials supplies and services 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing storing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

• well blowouts and cratering 

• loss of well control 

• crude oil spills natural gas leaks formation water ie produced water spills and pipeline ruptures 

• pipe failures and casing collapses 

• uncontrollable flows of crude oil natural gas formation water or drilling fluids 

• releases of chemicals wastes or pollutants 

• adverse weather events such as winter storms flooding tropical storms and hurricanes and other natural disasters 

• fires and explosions 

• terrorism vandalism and physical electronic and cybersecurity breaches 

• formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures 

• leaks or spills in connection with or associated with the gathering processing compression storage and transportation of crude oil ngls and natural gas and 

• malfunctions of or damage to gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

• injury or loss of life 

• damage to or destruction of property facilities equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs 

• pollution or other environmental damage 

• regulatory investigations and penalties as well as cleanup and remediation responsibilities and costs 

• suspension or interruption of our operations including due to injunction 

• repairs necessary to resume operations and 

• compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable however the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil ngls and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities and equipment may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression storage transportation and export facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities and equipment including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression storage transportation refining or export facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil ngls or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties that we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil ngls or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil ngls and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  for example our october 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and certain of its affiliated entities although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 

in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further above actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and some of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil ngls and natural gas certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition from competing energy sources such as renewable energy sources 

risks related to our international operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

• increases in taxes and governmental royalties 

• changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased companies 

• loss of revenue loss of or damage to equipment property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation nationalization acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks 

• unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities 

• difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations and 

• currency restrictions or exchange rate fluctuations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties and us laws with respect to participation in boycotts that are not supported by the us government the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

the regulatory legislative and policy changes pursued by the new us presidential administration may materially and adversely affect the oil and gas exploration and production industry 

in november 2020 joseph r biden jr was elected president of the united states new or revised rules regulations and policies may be issued and new legislation may be proposed during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry such rules regulations policies and legislation may affect among other things i permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands ii the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development iii the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions andor other climate changerelated matters associated with oil and gas operations iv the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands v the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and vi us federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled “tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad” directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to i pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and ii consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

further such regulatory legislative and policy changes may among other things result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating restrictions andor the imposition of various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations or other aspects of our business any of which could lead to operational delays increased operating and compliance costs andor other impacts on our business and operations and could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for related discussion see the below risk factors regarding legislative and regulatory matters impacting the oil and gas exploration and production industry 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance andor adversely affect our business and operations and in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including any changes that may result from the recent us elections and change in administration see the risk factor above with respect to the new us administration 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations including any changes that may result from the recent us elections and change in administration could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements and further some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations the us environmental protection agency us epa has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level in addition there were proposals and positions taken by president biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters further on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to among other things pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices 

any such requirements restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and further could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding hydraulic fracturing regulation see regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

regulations government policies and government and corporate initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a significant impact on our operations and we could incur significant cost in the future to comply 

local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the us epa’s rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions in addition our oil and gas production and processing operations are subject to the us epas new source performance standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations and gas processing plants 

at the international level in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 while the us withdrew from the paris agreement on november 4 2020 president biden issued an executive order on january 20 2021 recommitting the united states to the paris agreement in addition many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord further on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to among other things consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations and government policies will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations treaties or policies regarding climate change and ghg emissions including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the us by the new administration but the direct and indirect costs of such developments if enacted issued or applied could materially and adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations further the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation see i climate change  united states under item 1 business – regulation and ii the risk factor above with respect to the new us administration 

in addition the achievement of our current or future internal initiatives relating to the reduction of ghg emissions may increase our costs including requiring us to purchase emissions credits or offsets or may impact or otherwise limit our ability to execute on our business plans 

further increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

tax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation while these specific changes were not included in the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law in december 2017 no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future for example by the new us administration and if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal state local or nonus taxes including the imposition of or increases in production severance or similar taxes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

in addition legislation may be proposed with respect to the enactment of a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels based on the ghg emissions associated with such fuels a carbon tax would generally increase the prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls such price increases may in turn reduce demand for crude oil natural gas and ngls and materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any proposed or enacted tax law changes but any such changes if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or enacted tax law changes to determine the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition and take appropriate actions where necessary 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor above regarding our hedging activities we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the us securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an “enduser” exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts lessen the number of available counterparties and in turn increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to covid19 cybersecurity and other external factors 

outbreaks of communicable diseases can adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

global or national health concerns including a widespread outbreak of contagious disease can among other impacts negatively impact the global economy reduce demand and pricing for crude oil natural gas and ngls lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of contagious disease could lead to increased volatility in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices 

for example the current pandemic involving a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus covid19 and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact global demand and prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls in fact the substantial declines in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the covid19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oilexporting countries materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and other operating expenses our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock 

while in the second half of 2020 the prices for natural gas and ngls recovered to prepandemic levels and the prices for crude oil increased from their first half 2020 levels if such price declines were to reoccur and continue for an extended period of time our cash flows and results of operations would be further adversely affected as could the trading price of our common stock for further discussion regarding the potential impacts on us of lower commodity prices and extended declines in commodity prices see the related discussion in the first risk factor in this section 

further if the covid19 outbreak should continue or worsen we may also experience disruptions to commodities markets equipment supply chains and the availability of our workforce which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations in addition if the resulting economic downturn should continue or worsen our customers and other contractual parties may be unable to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us and may be unable to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes such inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries to fully assess the potential impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions 

as an oil and gas producer we face various security threats including i cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to or control of our sensitive information or to render our data or systems corrupted or unusable ii threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or to the security of thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering transportation processing fractionation refining and export facilities and iii threats from terrorist acts the potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems including internally developed software data hosting platforms realtime data acquisition systems thirdparty software cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms to i estimate our oil and gas reserves ii process and record financial and operating data iii process and analyze all stages of our business operations including exploration drilling completions production transportation pipelines and other related activities and iv communicate with our employees and vendors suppliers and other third parties although we have implemented and invested in and will continue to implement and invest in controls procedures and protections including internal and external personnel that are designed to protect our systems identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective 

our systems and networks and those of our business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks including without limitation denialofservice attacks malicious software data privacy breaches by employees insiders or others with authorized access cyber or phishingattacks ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems and other electronic security breaches if any of these security breaches were to occur we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations including our drilling completion production and corporate functions which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

• unauthorized access to and release of our business data reserves information strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies 

• data corruption communication interruption or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident 

• data corruption or operational disruptions of our productionrelated infrastructure which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges 

• unauthorized access to and release of personal information of our royalty owners employees and vendors which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information 

• a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations 

• a cybersecurity attack on thirdparty gathering transportation processing fractionation refining or export facilities which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production in either case resulting in a loss of revenues 

• a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities resulting in a loss of revenues 

• a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of noncompliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties 

• a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues and 

• a cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards 

further strategic targets such as energyrelated assets may be at a greater risk of terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the united states moreover external digital technologies control nearly all of the crude oil and natural gas distribution and refining systems in the us and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production a cybersecurity attack directed at for example crude oil and natural gas distribution systems could i damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment ii disrupt energy supplies and markets by delaying or preventing delivery of production to markets and iii make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions 

any such terrorist attack or cybersecurity attack that affects us our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business andor energyrelated assets could have a material adverse effect on our business including disruption of our operations damage to our reputation a loss of counterparty trust reimbursement or other costs increased compliance costs significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines penalties or intervention although we have business continuity plans in place our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and the infrastructure that supports our business while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts further our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

while we have experienced limited cybersecurity attacks in the past we have not suffered any losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future further as technologies evolve and cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated we are continually expending additional resources to modify or enhance our security measures to protect against such threats and to identify and remediate on a regular basis any vulnerabilities in our information systems and related infrastructure that may be detected and these expenditures in the future may be significant additionally the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters including increased regulatory focus on prevention which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks including cyberrelated attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has from time to time issued public warnings that indicate that energyrelated assets such as transportation and refining facilities might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 

any such actions and the threat of such actions including any resulting political instability or societal disruption could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including but not limited to the disruption of energy supplies and markets the reduction of overall demand for crude oil and natural gas increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the facilities and other infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities that we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production during that season 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events changes in temperature and precipitation patterns changes to ground and surface water availability and other related phenomena which could affect some or all of our operations our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events such as winter storms flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression storage transportation andor export facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression storage and transportation services and export services such extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered further the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced future production is therefore highly dependent upon the level of success of these activities for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage the following table summarizes eogs gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2020 excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three to five years approximately 02 million net acres will expire in 2021 02 million net acres will expire in 2022 and 01 million net acres will expire in 2023 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions as of december 31 2020 there were no proved undeveloped reserves puds associated with such undeveloped acreage in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future 

many of our oil and gas leases are large enough to accommodate more than one producing unit included in our undeveloped acreage is nonproducing acreage within such larger producing leases 

the agreement governing the acreage associated with our exploration program in oman is set to expire in 2024 with certain provisions allowing for extension of such term if commercial discoveries are found 

productive well summary  the following table represents eogs gross and net productive wells including 2482 wells in which we hold a royalty interest

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance is integral in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized a net loss of 605 million during 2020 as compared to net income of 2735 million for 2019 at december 31 2020 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 3220 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe a decrease of 109 mmboe from december 31 2019 during 2020 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves decreased by 108 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 9 billion cubic feet or 1 mmboe in each case from december 31 2019 

recent developments 

commodity prices the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact global demand and prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas see item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

in early march 2020 due to the failure of the members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and russia opec to reach an agreement on individual crude oil production limits saudi arabia unilaterally reduced the sales price of its crude oil and announced that it would increase its crude oil production the combination of these actions and the effects of the covid19 pandemic on crude oil demand resulted in significantly lower commodity prices in march and april 2020 in april 2020 the members of opec reached an agreement to cut crude oil production beginning in may 2020 and extending through april 2022 with the quantity of the production cuts decreasing over time subsequent indications of conformity with these agreedupon production cuts by opec combined with the evolving impacts of covid19 on crude oil demand have resulted in graduallyimproving market conditions in the second half of 2020 crude oil prices increased but remain significantly below average prices in 2019 as a result of the continuing rebalancing of crude oil supply resulting from the actions of opec and the continuing effect of the covid19 pandemic on global demand in addition ngl and natural gas prices have recovered to prepandemic levels 

in response to the commodity price environment in 2020 eog reduced activity across its operating areas and decreased its total capital expenditures eog also elected to reduce crude oil production by delaying initial production from new wells and shuttingin or otherwise curtailing existing production 

in early 2021 the members of opec met and agreed to taper off certain of their production curtailments agreed to in april 2020 through march 2021 subsequent to the meeting saudi arabia announced that it would unilaterally cut its production by an additional one million barrels per day in february 2021 and march 2021 these announcements have had a positive impact on crude oil prices 

as a result of the many uncertainties associated with i the world economic environment ii the covid19 pandemic and its continuing effect on the economies and financial markets of the world and iii any future actions by the members of opec and the effect of these uncertainties on worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices in the future however prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas have historically been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

eog will continue to monitor future market conditions and adjust its capital allocation strategy and production outlook accordingly in order to maximize shareholder value while maintaining its strong financial position 

2020 election in november 2020 joseph r biden jr was elected president of the united states on january 27 2021 president biden issued executive order 14008 entitled tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad directing the secretary of the interior to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders to i pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and ii consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs in addition new or revised rules regulations and policies may be issued and new legislation may be proposed during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry such rules regulations policies and legislation may affect among other things i permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands ii the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development iii the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions andor other climate changerelated matters associated with oil and gas operations iv the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands v the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and vi us federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies see regulation in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

eog will continue to monitor and assess any actions that could impact the oil and gas industry to determine the impact on its business and operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2020 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs 

during 2020 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years such efficiencies combined with new innovation and decreased service costs resulted in lower operating drilling and completion costs in 2020 in addition eog continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins exchanges or tactical acquisitions on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 76 and 77 of united states production during 2020 and 2019 respectively during 2020 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the delaware basin play eagle ford play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico and texas in the second quarter of 2020 eog delayed initial production from most newlycompleted wells and shut in some existing production during the third quarter of 2020 eog resumed the process of initiating production from completed wells and the legacy wells that were shutin were largely brought back online see item 1 business  exploration and production for further discussion 

trinidad in trinidad eog continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium block modified ua block block 4a modified ub block the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to heritage petroleum company limited 

in 2020 eog drilled three net wells and completed two net wells in trinidad the remaining net well made a discovery that is being evaluated 

other international in the sichuan basin sichuan province china eog continues to work with its partner petrochina under the production sharing contract and other related agreements to ensure uninterrupted production all natural gas produced from the baijaochang field is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina 

in 2020 eog entered into two agreements related to exploration and production rights in the sultanate of oman oman one agreement resulted in eog acquiring exploration and production rights to block 36 within oman the second agreement was a farmin agreement allowing eog to share in exploration and production rights within block 49 pursuant to that agreement eog participated in the drilling of one gross exploratory well which was in progress as of december 31 2020 

in march 2020 eog began the process of exiting its canada operations 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 22 at december 31 2020 and 19 at december 31 2019 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on april 1 2020 eog repaid upon maturity the 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 245 senior notes due 2020 

on april 14 2020 eog closed on its offering of 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4375 senior notes due 2030 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4950 senior notes due 2050 together the notes eog received net proceeds of 148 billion from the issuance of the notes which were used to repay the 440 senior notes due 2020 when they matured on june 1 2020 see below and for general corporate purposes including the funding of capital expenditures 

on june 1 2020 eog repaid upon maturity the 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 440 senior notes due 2020 

on february 1 2021 eog repaid upon maturity the 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4100 senior notes due 2021 

during 2020 eog funded 40 billion 386 million of which was noncash in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 10 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm debt and paid 821 million in dividends to common stockholders primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds of 148 billion from the issuance of the notes and net proceeds of 192 million from the sale of assets 

total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 37 billion to 41 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash transactions the majority of 2021 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings 

management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

operating revenues and other 

during 2020 operating revenues decreased 6348 million or 37 to 11032 million from 17380 million in 2019 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas decreased 4291 or 37 to 7290 million in 2020 from 11581 million in 2019 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2020 were approximately 89 of total wellhead revenues compared to 90 in 2019 during 2020 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1145 million compared to net gains of 180 million in 2019 gathering processing and marketing revenues decreased 2777 million during 2020 to 2583 million from 5360 million in 2019 net losses on asset dispositions of 47 million in 2020 were primarily due to the sales of proved properties and noncash property exchanges of unproved leasehold in texas and new mexico and the disposition of the marcellus shale assets compared to net gains on asset dispositions of 124 million in 2019 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 





1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

2 other international includes eogs united kingdom china and canada operations the united kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018 

3 dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet as applicable excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent as applicable includes crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas mmboe is calculated by multiplying the mboed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand 

2020 compared to 2019 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2020 decreased 3827 million or 40 to 5786 million from 9613 million in 2019 due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 2860 million and a decrease in production 967 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2020 decreased 33 to 3863 per barrel compared to 5772 per barrel in 2019 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2020 decreased 10 to 409 mbbld as compared to 456 mbbld in 2019 the decreased production was primarily in the eagle ford and the rocky mountain area partially offset by increased production in the permian basin 

ngls revenues in 2020 decreased 116 million or 15 to 668 million from 784 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead ngls price 130 million partially offset by an increase in production 13 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price decreased 16 to 1341 per barrel in 2020 compared to 1603 per barrel in 2019 ngl production in 2020 increased 1 to 136 mbbld as compared to 134 mbbld in 2019 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin partially offset by decreased production in the eagle ford 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2020 decreased 347 million or 29 to 837 million from 1184 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 251 million and a decrease in natural gas deliveries 96 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 23 to 183 per mcf in 2020 compared to 238 per mcf in 2019 natural gas deliveries in 2020 decreased 8 to 1252 mmcfd as compared to 1366 mmcfd in 2019 the decrease in production was primarily due to lower natural gas volumes in trinidad the marcellus shale and the rocky mountain area partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the permian basin 

during 2020 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 1145 million which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil ngl and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 1071 million during 2019 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 180 million which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 231 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities eog sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs to purchase thirdparty crude oil natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2020 decreased 124 million compared to 2019 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities the margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and eogs decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling may and june 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements 

2019 compared to 2018 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2019 increased 96 million or 1 to 9613 million from 9517 million in 2018 due primarily to an increase in production 1351 million partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1255 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2019 decreased 11 to 5772 per barrel compared to 6521 per barrel in 2018 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2019 increased 14 to 456 mbbld as compared to 400 mbbld in 2018 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

ngls revenues in 2019 decreased 343 million or 30 to 784 million from 1127 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead ngls price 518 million partially offset by an increase in production 175 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price decreased 40 to 1603 per barrel in 2019 compared to 2660 per barrel in 2018 ngl production in 2019 increased 16 to 134 mbbld as compared to 116 mbbld in 2018 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2019 decreased 118 million or 9 to 1184 million from 1302 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 280 million partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries 162 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 18 to 238 per mcf in 2019 compared to 292 per mcf in 2018 natural gas deliveries in 2019 increased 12 to 1366 mmcfd as compared to 1219 mmcfd in 2018 the increase in production was primarily due to higher deliveries in the united states resulting from increased production of associated natural gas from the permian basin and higher natural gas volumes in south texas 

during 2019 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 180 million which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 231 million during 2018 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 259 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2019 decreased 18 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities partially offset by higher margins on natural gas marketing activities 

operating and other expenses 

2020 compared to 2019  during 2020 operating expenses of 11576 million were 2105 million lower than the 13681 million incurred during 2019   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 





1 total excludes gathering and processing costs exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1063 million in 2020 decreased 304 million from 1367 million in 2019 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states 157 million and in canada 25 million lower workovers expenditures in the united states 103 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 12 million lease and well expenses decreased in the united states primarily due to decreased operating activities resulting from decreased production efficiency improvements and service cost reductions 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on eogs gathering system to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements the cost of dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 735 million in 2020 decreased 23 million from 758 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale 27 million the rocky mountain area 24 million and the eagle ford 20 million partially offset by increased transportation costs in the permian basin 56 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2020 decreased 350 million to 3400 million from 3750 million in 2019 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2020 were 390 million lower than in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in production in the united states 222 million and trinidad 22 million and lower unit rates in the united states 150 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment in 2020 were 40 million higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in expense related to gathering and storage assets and equipment 

ga expenses of 484 million in 2020 decreased 5 million from 489 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased employeerelated expenses 43 million and professional and other services 7 million partially offset by idle equipment and termination fees 46 million 

net interest expense of 205 million in 2020 was 20 million higher than 2019 primarily due to the issuance of the notes in april 2020 51 million and lower capitalized interest 7 million partially offset by repayment in june 2019 of the 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 21 million repayment in june 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 440 senior notes due 2020 13 million and repayment in april 2020 of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of 245 senior notes due 2020 10 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain ngls fractionation fees paid to third parties eog pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract ngls 

gathering and processing costs decreased 20 million to 459 million in 2020 compared to 479 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased operating costs in the eagle ford 16 million and decreased gathering and processing fees in the eagle ford 9 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale 5 million partially offset by increased gathering and processing fees in the permian basin 15 million 

exploration costs of 146 million in 2020 increased 6 million from 140 million in 2019 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 15 million partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses in the united states 8 million 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy and noncore natural gas and crude oil and combo plays in 2020 and legacy natural gas assets in 2019 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2020 decreased 322 million to 478 million 66 of wellhead revenues from 800 million 69 of wellhead revenues in 2019 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 232 million decreased ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 51 million and a state severance tax refund 27 million 

other income net was 10 million in 2020 compared to other income net of 31 million in 2019 the decrease of 21 million in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income 

in response to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the president of the united states signed the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act into law on march 27 2020 the cares act provides economic support to individuals and businesses through enhanced loan programs expanded unemployment benefits and certain payroll and income tax relief among other provisions the primary tax benefit of the cares act for eog was the acceleration of approximately 150 million of additional refundable alternative minimum tax amt credits into tax year 2019 these credits originated from amt paid by eog in years prior to 2018 and were reflected as a deferred tax asset and a noncurrent receivable as of december 31 2019 since they had been expected to either offset future current tax liabilities or be refunded on a declining balance schedule through 2021 the 150 million of additional refundable amt credits was received in july 2020 

further pandemic relief was contained in the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 the ca act which was signed into law by the president of the united states on december 27 2020 in addition the ca act provided government funding and limited corporate income tax relief primarily related to making permanent or extending certain tax provisions none of which were a material benefit for eog 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 135 million in 2020 compared to an income tax provision of 810 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 18 from 23 in 2019 the lower effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to eogs foreign operations and increased stockbased compensation tax deficiencies 

2019 compared to 2018  during 2019 operating expenses of 13681 million were 875 million higher than the 12806 million incurred during 2018   the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 





1 total excludes gathering and processing costs exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1367 million in 2019 increased 84 million from 1283 million in 2018 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs 76 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses 29 million in the united states partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the united kingdom 15 million due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in canada 11 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production 

transportation costs of 758 million in 2019 increased 11 million from 747 million in 2018 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the permian basin 91 million and south texas 11 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the eagle ford 77 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale 13 million 

dda expenses in 2019 increased 315 million to 3750 million from 3435 million in 2018 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2019 were 337 million higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in production in the united states 489 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 119 million and the sale of the united kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 33 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 489 million in 2019 increased 62 million from 427 million in 2018 primarily due to increased employeerelated expenses 48 million and increased information systems costs 8 million resulting from expanded operations 

net interest expense of 185 million in 2019 was 60 million lower than 2018 primarily due to repayment of the 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 in june 2019 30 million and the 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 in october 2018 18 million and an increase in capitalized interest 14 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 42 million to 479 million in 2019 compared to 437 million in 2018 primarily due to increased operating costs and fees in the permian basin 52 million the rocky mountain area 13 million and south texas 5 million partially offset by decreased operating costs in the united kingdom 33 million due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 

exploration costs of 140 million in 2019 decreased 9 million from 149 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the trinidad 17 million partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the united states 7 million 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2019 and 2018 

taxes other than income in 2019 increased 28 million to 800 million 69 of wellhead revenues from 772 million 65 of wellhead revenues in 2018 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in ad valoremproperty taxes 53 million partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2019 for state incentive severance tax rate reductions 12 million and a decrease in severanceproduction taxes 12 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues all in the united states 

other income net was 31 million in 2019 compared to other income net of 17 million in 2018 the increase of 14 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income 14 million and an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 9 million partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense 4 million 

eog recognized an income tax provision of 810 million in 2019 compared to an income tax provision of 822 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased pretax income partially offset by the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurementperiod adjustments the net effective tax rate for 2019 increased to 23 from 19 in the prior year primarily due to the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurementperiod adjustments 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash flow 

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 were funds generated from operations net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts and proceeds from asset sales the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures repayments of debt dividend payments to stockholders and other property plant and equipment expenditures 

2020 compared to 2019   net cash provided by operating activities of 5008 million in 2020 decreased 3155 million from 8163 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues 4291 million unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 166 million a decrease in gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs 124 million and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 86 million partially offset by an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts 840 million and a decrease in cash operating expenses 641 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 3348 million in 2020 decreased by 2829 million from 6177 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties 2908 million an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets 52 million a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 49 million and a decrease in other investing activities 10 million partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital associated with investing activities 190 million

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in millions 





1 leasehold acquisitions included 197 million 98 million and 291 million related to noncash property exchanges in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

2 property acquisitions included 15 million 52 million and 71 million related to noncash property exchanges in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

3 other property plant and equipment included noncash additions of 174 million primarily related to finance lease transactions for storage facilities and 49 million primarily related to a finance lease transaction in the permian basin in 2020 and 2018 respectively 

exploration and development expenditures of 3601 million for 2020 were 2841 million lower than the prior year the decrease was primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states 2309 million decreased facilities expenditures 282 million and decreased property acquisitions 245 million partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in trinidad 27 million the 2020 exploration and development expenditures of 3601 million included 2905 million in development drilling and facilities 530 million in exploration 135 million in property acquisitions and 31 million in capitalized interest the 2019 exploration and development expenditures of 6442 million included 5513 million in development drilling and facilities 511 million in exploration 380 million in property acquisitions and 38 million in capitalized interest the 2018 exploration and development expenditures of 6350 million included 5546 million in development drilling and facilities 656 million in exploration 124 million in property acquisitions and 24 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors eog believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

during 2020 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad china and canada eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2021 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 18 2021 the average 2021 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 5751 per barrel and 298 per mmbtu respectively representing an increase of 46 for crude oil and an increase of 43 for natural gas from the average nymex prices in 2020 see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs crude oil and ngl derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2021 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 99 million for net income and 127 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2021 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 31 million for net income and 40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil ngls and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 18 2021 see commodity derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its delaware basin eagle ford and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs in addition eog expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2021 capital expenditures on leasing acreage and evaluating new prospects 

  

the total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures of approximately 37 billion to 41 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash transactions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2021 total crude oil production is expected to remain at fourth quarter 2020 levels in 2021 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration and development costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are expensed as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves if commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves are revised upward or downward earnings will increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2020 wti crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 3698 per barrel to 7741 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 133 per mmbtu to 624 per mmbtu market prices for ngls are influenced by the components extracted including ethane propane butane and natural gasoline among others and the respective market pricing for each component 

eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas and the fiveyear oil price information services futures strip for ngls components in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules in the future if any combination of crude oil prices ngls prices natural gas prices actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility in the price of shares and composition of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

general 

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the peoples republic of china china canada and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10‑q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports including related exhibits and supplemental schedules filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is wwweogresourcescom information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this report 

at december 31 2019  eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 3329 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1694 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 740 mmbbl were ngls reserves and 5370 billion cubic feet bcf or 895 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 98 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 1 in trinidad and 1 in other international areas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

as of december 31 2019  eog employed approximately 2900 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related for information regarding the risks associated with eogs domestic and foreign operations see item 1a risk factors 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog is focused on costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drilling equipment completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks and costs associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are located in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2019  on a crude oil equivalent basis 52 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 23 were ngls and 25 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio 

the following is a summary of significant developments during 2019 and anticipated 2020 plans for certain areas of eogs united states operations 





 

the eagle ford is a worldclass crude oil field which has produced in excess of 34 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate with approximately 516000 of its 579000 total net acres in the prolific oil window eog continues to be the largest crude oil producer in the eagle ford with cumulative gross production in excess of 600 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate in 2019 eog completed 321 net eagle ford wells and 14 net austin chalk wells eog continues to evaluate the prospectivity of the austin chalk which overlays eogs eagle ford acreage eog has approximately 150 eagle ford net wells in its enhanced oil recovery eor gas injection program the company did not add wells to the eor program in 2019 and does not expect to add wells in 2020 eor is a secondary recovery process and the company continues to evaluate the primary development opportunities on its acreage before expanding the eor program in 2020 eog expects to complete approximately 300 net eagle ford wells and 6 net austin chalk wells while continuing to improve well productivity and operational efficiencies the combination of exceptional execution and continuous operational improvements have made this play one of the foundations of eogs portfolio 

in the delaware basin eog completed 276 net wells during 2019 primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp bone spring and leonard plays eog also identified additional drilling locations in the wolfcamp m and third bone spring formations expanding its inventory of future drilling locations across its approximately 389000 total net acre position the delaware basin consists of approximately 4800 feet of stacked pay potential across multiple zones offering eog codevelopment opportunities across its acreage position 

in the delaware basin wolfcamp play where it has approximately 346000 net acres eog completed 201 net wells in 2019 eog continued its development plan with well spacing as close as 500 feet in the crude oil portion and 880 feet in the combination crude oil and natural gas portion results in the delaware basin wolfcamp program were supported by optimized well spacing the application of enhanced well completions precision drilling and continued cost reductions the delaware basin wolfcamp play will continue to be a primary area of focus in 2020 

in the third bone spring play eog completed 13 net wells in 2019 on its 200000 net prospective acres with multiple targets and ample codevelopment opportunities the third bone spring play is expected to be a large portion of eog’s future development program in the second bone spring play eog holds approximately 289000 net acres and completed 34 net wells in 2019 eog also continued development in the first bone spring play where eog has approximately 100000 net acres and completed nine net wells in 2019 both the first and second bone spring plays continue to be an integral part of eog’s delaware basin portfolio 

in the leonard play eog has approximately 160000 net acres and continued development with 19 net wells completed in 2019 

activity in 2020 will continue to be focused in the delaware basin wolfcamp third bone spring second bone spring first bone spring and leonard plays where eog expects to complete approximately 350 net wells 

activity in the rocky mountain area was consistent in 2019 with a focus on the wyoming powder river basin in the powder river basin eog operated a tworig program and completed 32 net wells in the niobrara mowry turner and parkman formations the focus in 2019 was to delineate the mowry and niobrara plays and to begin adding infrastructure drilling activity and infrastructure buildout will increase significantly in 2020 as activity shifts to development drilling the infrastructure added will lower operating costs and increase price realizations going forward in the wyoming dj basin eog operated one rig and completed 44 net wells in 2019 in both the codell and the niobrara formations activity in the dj basin is expected to be moderate in 2020 as activity shifts to the powder river basin in the williston basin eog completed 20 net wells in the bakken and three forks on average well performance in the williston basin greatly improved due to better targeting and completion techniques the seasonal program of completing wells mostly in the summer while drilling throughout the year will continue in 2020 although activity will be at a slightly lower pace than 2019 eog currently holds approximately 13 million net acres in the rocky mountain area 

in the midcontinent area eog continued its development of the woodford oil window play with 30 net wells completed during 2019 eog holds 41700 net acres in the play and plans to build on its results in the woodford oil window with 20 net well completions in 2020 in 2019 eog completed 11 gross two net wells in the western anadarko basin marmaton sand 

net production for the marcellus shale in 2019 averaged approximately 683 mmcfd of natural gas at december 31 2019 eog held approximately 151000 net acres in the marcellus shale 

fort worth basin barnett shale production averaged 17 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 122 mbbld of ngls and 674 mmcfd of natural gas in 2019 

in the south texas area eog completed 15 net wells in 2019 exploration and evaluation efforts will continue in this region in 2020 where we expect to drill and complete another 15 net wells 

at december 31 2019 eog held approximately 23 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2019 eog continued to operate gathering and processing facilities in the eagle ford in south texas the williston basin bakken and three forks plays in north dakota the fort worth basin barnett shale and the permian basin in west texas and new mexico at december 31 2019 eogowned natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford and the fort worth basin barnett shale totaled 325 mmcfd and 180 mmcfd respectively 

operations outside the united states 

eog has operations offshore trinidad in the china sichuan basin and in canada and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas 

trinidad  eog through several of its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited 



 

several fields in the secc block modified ua block modified ub block block 4a the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary ngc crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts to heritage petroleum company limited heritage 

in 2019 eogs net production from trinidad averaged approximately 260 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 06 mbbld of crude oil and condensate in 2019 eog drilled and completed two net wells in trinidad and was in the process of drilling another exploratory well at december 31 2019 one of these wells was a successful development well while the other well was determined to be an unsuccessful exploratory well in addition eog drilled one stratigraphic exploratory well in trinidad which discovered commercially economic reserves at december 31 2019 eog held approximately 115000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

in 2020 eog expects to drill and complete three net wells in trinidad all of the natural gas produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2020 is expected to be sold to ngc all crude oil and condensate produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2020 is expected to be sold to heritage 

china  in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acerage 

in 2019 eog drilled two natural gas wells to complete the drilling program started in 2018 in 2019 eog also completed two natural gas wells that were drilled during the 2018 drilling program all natural gas produced from the baijaochang field is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina in 2019 production averaged approximately 30 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

eog plans to continue to complete the remaining drilled uncompleted wells ducs in the future as pipeline capacity allows 

marketing 

in 2019 eog continued its diversified approach to marketing its wellhead crude oil and condensate production the majority of production was transported by pipeline to downstream markets with the remainder sold into local markets major us sales areas accessed by eog were various locations along the us gulf coast including houston and corpus christi texas and louisiana cushing oklahoma the permian basin and the midwest in late 2019 eog also sold crude oil at the houston ship channel hsc for export to foreign destinations in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location in 2020 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same in 2020 eog expects to sell crude oil at the port of corpus christi for export in addition to sales at the hsc at december 31 2019 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of crude oil of 28 mmbbls in 2020 and 2 mmbbls in 2021 all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

in 2019 eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices into either local markets or downstream locations in certain instances eog exchanged its ngl production for purity products received downstrean which were sold at prevailing market prices in 2020 such pricing mechanisms are expected to remain the same 

in 2019 consistent with its diversified marketing strategy the majority of eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was transported by pipeline to various locations including katy texas east texas the agua dulce hub in south texas the cheyenne hub in weld county colorado southern california and chicago illinois remaining natural gas production was sold into local markets in each case pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point in 2020 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same additionally in 2019 eog entered into an agreement beginning in 2020 to sell natural gas to an lng liquefaction facility near corpus christi texas and receive pricing based on the platts japan korea marker at december 31 2019 eog was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of natural gas of 159 bcf in 2020 108 bcf in 2021 82 bcf in 2022 82 bcf in 2023 31 bcf in 2024 and 1685 bcf thereafter all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

in 2019 a majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices and under a fixed price contract the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2020 however we anticipate the majority of volumes will be sold under a fixed price contract 

in 2019 all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2020 

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2019 two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues the two purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2019 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and other federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation generally  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act further the us epa in may 2016 issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds voc from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

at the international level the us in december 2015 participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however the us has begun the process to withdraw from the paris agreement in response many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 as amended 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations further the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states substantially all of the onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

  

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa has also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

also in november 2016 the blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands though in september 2018 the blm issued a final rule rescinding certain requirements of that rule there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level in addition there have been proposals and positions taken by candidates for elected office and others regarding additional restrictions on or the complete prohibition of hydraulic fracturing operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements operating restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with laws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however eog is unable to predict i the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states or other aspects of our operations and ii the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations relating to such future laws and regulations the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad china and canada eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations outside the united states associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas outside the united states where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report 

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 11 in 2019 and increased 28 in 2018 and 22 in 2017 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 40 in 2019 and increased 18 in 2018 and 55 in 2017 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 23 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2019 a 31 increase inclusive of a positive revenue adjustment of 044 per mcf related to the adoption of asu 201409 in 2018 and a 38 increase in 2017 each as compared to the immediately preceding year 

due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries the global supply of and demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in the prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity exclusive of basis swaps in 2020 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 117 million for net income and 152 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2020 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 31 million for net income and 40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2020 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2020 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ‑ capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil ngl and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil ngl and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes flooding and other adverse weather events moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce eogs revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 



 

the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil natural gas and ngl prices as a result there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls will sustain or increase from their current levels and not decline 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and also possibly shut in or plug and abandon certain wells in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which will require us to write down the value of our properties such reserve writedowns and asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

if commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time our financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock in addition we may be required to incur impairment charges andor make downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 



 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing storing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable however the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions 

as an oil and gas producer we face various security threats including i cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to or control of our sensitive information or to render our data or systems corrupted or unusable ii threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or to the security of thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering transportation processing fractionation refining and export facilities and iii threats from terrorist acts the potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems including internally developed software data hosting platforms realtime data acquisition systems thirdparty software cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms to i estimate our oil and gas reserves ii process and record financial and operating data iii process and analyze all stages of our business operations including exploration drilling completions production transportation pipelines and other related activities and iv communicate with our employees and vendors suppliers and other third parties although we have implemented and invested in and will continue to implement and invest in controls procedures and protections including internal and external personnel that are designed to protect our systems identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective 

our systems and networks and those of our business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks including without limitation denialofservice attacks malicious software data privacy breaches by employees insiders or others with authorized access cyber or phishingattacks ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems and other electronic security breaches if any of these security breaches were to occur we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations including our drilling completion production and corporate functions which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

 

further strategic targets such as energyrelated assets may be at a greater risk of terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the united states of america united states or us moreover external digital technologies control nearly all of the crude oil and natural gas distribution and refining systems in the us and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production a cybersecurity attack directed at for example crude oil and natural gas distribution systems could i damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment ii disrupt energy supplies and markets by delaying or preventing delivery of production to markets and iii make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions 

any such terrorist attack or cybersecurity attack that affects us our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business andor energyrelated assets could have a material adverse effect on our business including disruption of our operations damage to our reputation a loss of counterparty trust reimbursement or other costs increased compliance costs significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines penalties or intervention although we have business continuity plans in place our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and the infrastructure that supports our business while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts further our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past we have not suffered any losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future further as technologies evolve and cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated we are continually expending additional resources to modify or enhance our security measures to protect against such threats and to identify and remediate on a regular basis any vulnerabilities in our information systems and related infrastructure that may be detected and these expenditures in the future may be significant additionally the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters including increased regulatory focus on prevention which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil ngls and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities export facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression storage or transportation facilities export facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil ngls and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements and further some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations in november 2016 however the us bureau of land management blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands in september 2018 the blm issued a final rule rescinding certain requirements of the rule in addition the us environmental protection agency us epa has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level further there have been proposals and positions taken by candidates for elected office and others regarding additional restrictions on or the complete prohibition of hydraulic fracturing operations 

any such requirements restrictions conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and further could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding hydraulic fracturing regulation see regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other operations  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a significant impact on our operations and we could incur significant cost in the future to comply 

local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

at the international level in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however the us has begun the process to withdraw from the paris agreement in response many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation see climate change  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

further increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

tax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation while these specific changes were not included in the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law in december 2017 no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future and if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal state local or nonus taxes including the imposition of or increases in production severance or similar taxes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil ngls and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression storage transportation refining or export facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil ngls or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil ngls or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil ngls and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  for example our october 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and certain of its affiliated entities although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 

in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings and sales of noncore assets and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil ngls and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings 

similarly a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil ngls and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to obtain financings our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies the interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned capital expenditures and sales of assets nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering processing compression storage transportation and refining facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and some of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological geophysical and engineering evaluation methods 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression storage and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production during that season 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events changes in temperature and precipitation patterns changes to ground and surface water availability and other related phenomena which could affect some or all of our operations our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events such as winter storms flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression storage transportation andor export facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression storage and transportation services and export services such extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial basis swap price swap option swaption and collar contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts a portion of our forecasted production for 2020 is subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2020 and beyond we will be impacted by any declines in commodity prices which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the us securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts lessen the number of available counterparties and in turn increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions and modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks including cyberrelated attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energyrelated assets such as transportation and refining facilities might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 

any such actions and the threat of such actions including any resulting political instability or society disruption could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including but not limited to the disruption of energy supplies and markets the reduction of overall demand for crude oil and natural gas increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the facilities and other infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

reserve information for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered further the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage the following table summarizes eogs gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2019  excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 04 million net acres will expire in 2020 03 million net acres will expire in 2021 and 01 million net acres will expire in 2022 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future as of december 31 2019 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with such undeveloped acreage

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized net income of 2735 million during 2019 as compared to net income of 3419 million for 2018 at december 31 2019 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 3329 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 401 mmboe from december 31 2018 during 2019 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 287 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 683 billion cubic feet or 114 mmboe in each case from december 31 2018 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2019 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs 

during 2019 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years in addition eog continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins exchanges or tactical acquisitions on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 77 of united states production during both 2019 and 2018 during 2019 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the eagle ford play delaware basin play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico north dakota texas and wyoming 

trinidad in trinidad eog continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a modified ub block the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary ngc and crude oil and condensate which is sold to heritage petroleum company limited in 2019 eog drilled and completed two net wells in trinidad and was in the process of drilling another exploratory well at december 31 2019 one of these wells was a successful development well while the other well was determined to be an unsuccessful exploratory well in addition eog drilled one stratigraphic exploratory well in trinidad which discovered commercially economic reserves 

other international in the sichuan basin sichuan province china eog drilled two natural gas wells in 2019 to complete the drilling program started in 2018 in 2019 eog also completed two natural gas wells that were drilled during the 2018 drilling program all natural gas produced from the baijaochang field is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 at december 31 2019 and 24 at december 31 2018 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on june 3 2019 eog repaid upon maturity the 900 million aggregate principal amount of its 5625 senior notes due 2019 

on june 27 2019 eog entered into a new 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement new facility with domestic and foreign lenders banks the new facility replaced eogs 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of july 21 2015 which had a scheduled maturity date of july 21 2020 the new facility has a scheduled maturity date of june 27 2024 and includes an option for eog to extend on up to two occasions the term for successive oneyear periods subject to certain terms and conditions the new facility i commits the banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of 20 billion at any one time outstanding with an option for eog to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed 30 billion subject to certain terms and conditions and ii includes a swingline subfacility and a letter of credit subfacility 

effective january 1 2019 eog adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu 201602 leases topic 842 asu 201602 asu 201602 and other related asus resulted in the recognition of rightofuse assets and related lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments for certain lease transactions and the disclosure of additional leasing information the adoption of asu 201602 and other related asus resulted in a significant increase to assets and liabilities related to operating leases on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019 financial results prior to january 1 2019 are unchanged see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 18 leases to eogs consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2019 eog funded 67 billion 152 million of which was noncash in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 900 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 588 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 25 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of 140 million from the sale of assets 

total anticipated 2020 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 63 billion to 67 billion  excluding acquisitions and noncash exchanges the majority of 2020 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its new facility joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings 

management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

operating revenues and other 

during 2019 operating revenues increased 105 million  or 1  to 17380 million from 17275 million in 2018 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas decreased 365 million  or 3  to 11581 million in 2019 from 11946 million in 2018 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2019 were approximately 90 of total wellhead revenues compared to 89 in 2018 during 2019 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 180 million compared to net losses of 166 million in 2018 gathering processing and marketing revenues increased 130 million during 2019 to 5360 million from 5230 million in 2018 net gains on asset dispositions of 124 million in 2019 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties acreage and other assets as well as noncash property exchanges in new mexico compared to net gains on asset dispositions of 175 million in 2018 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows 







2019 compared to 2018 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2019 increased 96 million  or 1  to 9613 million from 9517 million in 2018 due primarily to an increase in production  1351 million  partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1255 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2019 decreased 11 to 5772 per barrel compared to 6521 per barrel in 2018 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2019 increased 14 to 456 mbbld as compared to 400 mbbld in 2018 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

ngls revenues in 2019 decreased 343 million  or 30  to 784 million from 1127 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead ngls price  518 million  partially offset by an increase in production 175 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price decreased 40 to 1603 per barrel in 2019 compared to 2660 per barrel in 2018 ngl production in 2019 increased 16 to 134 mbbld as compared to 116 mbbld in 2018 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2019 decreased 118 million  or 9  to 1184 million from 1302 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price  280 million  partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries 162 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 18 to 238 per mcf in 2019 compared to 292 per mcf in 2018 natural gas deliveries in 2019 increased 12 to 1366 mmcfd as compared to 1219 mmcfd in 2018 the increase in production was primarily due to higher deliveries in the united states resulting from increased production of associated natural gas from the permian basin and higher natural gas volumes in south texas 

during 2019 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 180 million  which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of  231 million  during 2018 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million  which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 259 million  

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities eog sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs to purchase thirdparty crude oil natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2019 decreased 18 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities partially offset by higher margins on natural gas marketing activities 

2018 compared to 2017 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2018 increased 3261 million  or 52  to 9517 million from 6256 million in 2017 due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price  2088 million  and an increase in production  1173 million  eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2018 increased 28 to 6521 per barrel compared to 5091 per barrel in 2017 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2018 increased 19 to 400 mbbld as compared to 337 mbbld in 2017 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

ngls revenues in 2018 increased 398 million  or 55  to 1127 million from 729 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production  229 million  and a higher composite average wellhead ngls price  169 million eogs composite average wellhead ngls price increased 18 to 2660 per barrel in 2018 compared to 2261 per barrel in 2017 ngls production in 2018 increased 31 to 116 mbbld as compared to 88 mbbld in 2017 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2018 increased 380 million  or 41  to 1302 million from 922 million in 2017 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price  282 million  and an increase in wellhead natural gas deliveries  98 million  eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 28 to 292 per mcf in 2018 compared to 229 per mcf in 2017 this increase in composite wellhead natural gas prices includes a positive revenue adjustment of 044 per mcf related to the adoption of asu 201409 natural gas deliveries in 2018 increased 11 to 1219 mmcfd as compared to 1103 mmcfd in 2017 the increase in production was primarily due to increased production in the united states  158 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production in trinidad  47 mmcfd the increased production in the united states was due primarily to increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and rocky mountain area and higher volumes in the marcellus shale the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2017 

during 2018 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million  which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 259 million  during 2017 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 20 million  which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 7 million  

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2018 increased 59 million compared to 2017 primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities 

operating and other expenses 

2019 compared to 2018  during 2019 operating expenses of 13681 million were 875 million higher than the 12806 million incurred during 2018   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1367 million in 2019 increased 84 million from 1283 million in 2018 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs 76 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses 29 million in the united states partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the united kingdom 15 million due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in canada 11 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements the cost of dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 758 million in 2019 increased 11 million from 747 million in 2018 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the permian basin 91 million and south texas 11 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the eagle ford 77 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale 13 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2019 increased 315 million to 3750 million from 3435 million in 2018 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2019 were 337 million higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in production in the united states 489 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 119 million and the sale of the united kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 33 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 489 million in 2019 increased 62 million from 427 million in 2018 primarily due to increased employeerelated expenses 48 million and increased information systems costs 8 million resulting from expanded operations 

net interest expense of 185 million in 2019 was 60 million lower than 2018 primarily due to repayment of the 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 in june 2019 30 million and the 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 in october 2018 18 million and an increase in capitalized interest 14 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain ngls fractionation fees paid to third parties eog pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract ngls see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion related to eogs adoption of asu 201409 

gathering and processing costs increased 42 million to 479 million in 2019 compared to 437 million in 2018 primarily due to increased operating costs and fees in the permian basin 52 million the rocky mountain area 13 million and south texas 5 million partially offset by decreased operating costs in the united kingdom 33 million due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 

exploration costs of 140 million in 2019 decreased 9 million from 149 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in trinidad 17 million partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the united states 7 million 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2019 and 2018 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2019 increased 28 million to 800 million  69 of wellhead revenues from 772 million  65 of wellhead revenues in 2018 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in ad valoremproperty taxes 53 million partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2019 for state incentive severance tax rate reductions 12 million and a decrease in severanceproduction taxes 12 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues all in the united states 

other income net was 31 million in 2019 compared to other income net of 17 million in 2018 the increase of 14 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income 14 million and an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 9 million partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense 4 million 

eog recognized an income tax provision of 810 million in 2019 compared to an income tax provision of 822 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased pretax income partially offset by the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurementperiod adjustments the net effective tax rate for 2019 increased to 23 from 19 in the prior year primarily due to the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurementperiod adjustments 

2018 compared to 2017  during 2018 operating expenses of 12806 million were 875 million higher than the 10282 million incurred during 2017   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017

transportation costs of 747 million in 2018 increased 7 million from 740 million in 2017 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the permian basin 116 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale 52 million the eagle ford 31 million and the rocky mountain area 25 million 

dda expenses in 2018 increased 26 million to 3435 million from 3409 million in 2017 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2018 were 24 million higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production in the united states 647 million and the united kingdom 21 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 625 million and a decrease in production in trinidad 16 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 427 million in 2018 decreased 7 million from 434 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased professional legal and other services 24 million partially offset by increased employeerelated expenses resulting from expanded operations 15 million and increased information systems costs 10 million 

net interest expense of 245 million in 2018 was 29 million lower than 2017 primarily due to repayment of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2017 in september 2017 25 million and the 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 in october 2018 6 million partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest 3 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 288 million to 437 million in 2018 compared to 149 million in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of asu 201409 204 million and increased operating costs in the permian basin 32 million the united kingdom 28 million and the eagle ford 25 million 

exploration costs of 149 million in 2018 increased 4 million from 145 million in 2017 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses in the united states 7 million partially offset by decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in trinidad 5 million 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2018 and 2017 

taxes other than income in 2018 increased 227 million to 772 million  65 of wellhead revenues from 545 million  69 of wellhead revenues in 2017 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 190 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and an increase in ad valoremproperty taxes 33 million both in the united states 

other income net was 17 million in 2018 compared to other income net of 9 million in 2017 the increase of 8 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense 12 million and an increase in interest income 4 million partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses 15 million 

eog recognized an income tax provision of 822 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of 1921 million in 2017 primarily due to the absence of certain 2017 tax benefits related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja and higher pretax income the most significant impact of the tcja on eog was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 which required the existing net united states federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit in 2017 of approximately 22 billion the net effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 19 from 291 in the prior year primarily due to the absence of the tcja tax benefits

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 at december 31 2019 compared to 24 at december 31 2018 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively eog had outstanding  5140 million and  6040 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of  5452 million and  6027 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2019 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales while eog maintains a  20 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2019 and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero  eog considers the availability of its  20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility as described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2020 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 19 2020 the average 2020 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 5375 per barrel and 212 per mmbtu respectively representing a decrease of 6 for crude oil and a decrease of 20 for natural gas from the average nymex prices in 2019 see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity exclusive of basis swaps in 2020 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 117 million for net income and 152 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2020 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 31 million for net income and 40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2020 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its delaware basin eagle ford and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs 

  

the total anticipated 2020 capital expenditures of approximately  63 billion to  67 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash exchanges is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2020 both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2019 levels in 2020 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are expensed as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil ngls and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2019 wti crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 2619 per barrel to 7741 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 149 per mmbtu to 624 per mmbtu market prices for ngls are influenced by the production composition of ethane propane butane and natural gasoline and the respective market pricing for each component eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules in the future if any combination of crude oil prices natural gas prices actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility in the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

general 

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the peoples republic of china china canada and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10‑q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports including related exhibits and supplemental schedules filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is wwweogresourcescom information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this report 

at december 31 2018  eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2928 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1532 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 614 mmbbl were natural gas liquids ngls reserves and 4687 billion cubic feet bcf or 782 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 98 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 1 in trinidad and 1 in other international areas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

as of december 31 2018  eog employed approximately 2800 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related for information regarding the risks associated with eogs domestic and foreign operations see item 1a risk factors 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog is focused on costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drilling equipment completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks and costs associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are located in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2018  on a crude oil equivalent basis 53 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 21 were ngls and 26 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio 

the following is a summary of significant developments during 2018  and certain 2019  plans for eogs united states operations 





 

the eagle ford continues to prove itself as a worldclass crude oil field having produced in excess of 29 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate with approximately 516000 of its 579000 total net acres in the prolific oil window eog continues to be the largest crude oil producer in the eagle ford with cumulative gross production in excess of 490 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate in 2018 eog completed 304 net eagle ford wells and continued to test the austin chalk play concept with the completion of 27 net austin chalk wells eog is still evaluating the extent of prospectivity of the austin chalk which overlays the eagle ford eog also continued its enhanced oil recovery eor gas injection program in 2018 adding 54 wells to the program eog does not expect to add wells to the eor program in 2019 while it evaluates additional primary development opportunities eog expects to complete approximately 300 net eagle ford wells and 15 net austin chalk wells in 2019 while continuing to improve well productivity and operational efficiencies the combination of exceptional execution and continuous operational improvements have made this play one of the foundations of eogs portfolio 

in the permian basin eog completed 265 net wells during 2018 primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale bone spring and leonard plays eog continued to consolidate its acreage position in each of these worldclass assets through small leasing transactions and the exchange of acreage with other nearby operators eog has approximately 346000 net acres in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale play where it completed 219 net wells in 2018 the success of the 2018 wolfcamp program was due to precision targeting highdensity stimulations and continued cost reductions the program shifted toward the development of larger packages of wells during 2018 which also contributed to cost reductions the highreturn delaware basin wolfcamp shale play will continue to be a primary area of focus in 2019 in the second bone spring play eog holds approximately 289000 net acres and completed 18 net wells in 2018 the second bone spring play is another integral part of eogs permian basin portfolio in the leonard shale play eog has approximately 160000 net acres and continued development with 17 net wells completed in 2018 eog also had strong results in the first bone spring where it holds approximately 100000 net acres and completed eight net wells in 2018 activity in 2019 will continue to be focused in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale second bone spring first bone spring and leonard plays where eog expects to complete approximately 270 net wells 

activity in the rocky mountain area increased in 2018 with a focus on the wyoming powder river and dj basins in the powder river basin eog operated a tworig program completing 41 net wells and identified future drilling locations mostly in the mowry and niobrara formations the focus in 2019 will be to add infrastructure and operate a drilling program to further delineate the basin and test additional targets to better position the company for a more robust development program in 2020 and beyond in the wyoming dj basin drilling completion and operating costs continued to decline and there is a significant highreturn development program scheduled for 2019 drilling activity increased in the williston basin in 2018 after pausing for several years while the company reduced its inventory of drilled uncompleted wells ducs the 20 net wells completed in 2018 targeted the bakken and three forks formations and benefited from the application of precision targeting activity in 2019 will be similar as will the seasonal program of completing wells mostly in the summer while drilling operations are conducted throughout the year eog currently holds approximately 12 million net acres in the rocky mountain area 

in the midcontinent area eog continued its development of the woodford oil window play with 26 net wells completed during 2018 eog holds 47000 net acres in the play and plans to build on its initial success in the woodford oil window with 30 net well completions in 2019 in 2018 eog completed 22 gross four net wells in the western anadarko basin marmaton sand 

total net production in 2018 from the fort worth basin barnett shale and marcellus shale averaged 2 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 14 mbbld of ngls and 137 mmcfd of natural gas development activity in these areas was concentrated in the marcellus shale in 2018 where eog completed 15 net ducs net production in the marcellus shale for 2018 averaged 59 mmcfd of natural gas with a peak net rate of 102 mmcfd eog currently holds approximately 172000 net acres with marcellus potential at yearend 2018 eog held approximately 152000 net acres in the fort worth basin 

at yearend 2018 eog held approximately 441000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region eog remained focused on exploration and evaluation efforts last year with minimal activity and expects these efforts will continue in 2019 

in the south texas area eog completed eight net liquidsrich natural gas wells in 2018 including three net ducs from prior years eog has deferred completion of five additional net wells and expects to complete these liquidsrich natural gas wells in 2019 in the frio and vicksburg trends where it holds approximately 391000 net acres in addition exploration and evaluation efforts will continue in this region in 2019 

at december 31 2018 eog held approximately 24 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2018 eog continued to operate its gathering and processing facilities in the eagle ford in south texas the williston basin bakken and three forks plays in north dakota the fort worth basin barnett shale and the permian basin in west texas and new mexico at december 31 2018 eogowned natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford and the fort worth basin barnett shale totaled 325 mmcfd and 180 mmcfd respectively 

operations outside the united states 

eog has operations offshore trinidad in the china sichuan basin and in canada and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas eog sold its operations in the united kingdom uk east irish sea in the fourth quarter of 2018 

trinidad  eog through several of its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited 



 

several fields in the secc block modified ua block modified ub block block 4a the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary ngc crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited and its successor heritage petroleum company limited in 2018 eogs net production from trinidad averaged approximately 266 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 08 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

in 2018 eog conducted an ocean bottom nodal seismic survey in the secc block and the pelican field and continues to process and review the initial data 

in 2019 eog expects to drill five wells of which two of these wells are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2019 and one well is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 all of the natural gas produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2019 is expected to be supplied to ngc under various contracts with ngc all crude oil and condensate produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2019 is expected to be supplied to heritage petroleum company limited under various contracts with heritage petroleum company limited 

at december 31 2018  eog held approximately 115000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom  eog completed the sale of all of its interest in eog resources united kingdom limited during the fourth quarter of 2018 eog no longer has any presence in the uk 

in 2018  production averaged approximately 42 mbbld of crude oil net in the uk 

china  in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage eog entered 2018 with two ducs and completed both wells in addition eog drilled five natural gas wells and completed one of those wells in 2018 as part of the continuing development of the bajiaochang field which natural gas is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina eog plans to drill two additional wells in 2019 and complete the remaining 2018 wells in progress as pipeline capacity allows 

in 2018  production averaged approximately 23 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

canada eog maintains approximately 134000 net acres with 23 net producing wells in the horn river area in northeast british columbia 

in 2018 net production in canada averaged approximately 8 mmcfd of natural gas 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

in 2018  eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was transported either by pipeline or truck to downstream markets or sold into local markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major us sales areas included the midwest the permian basin cushing oklahoma houston and corpus christi texas and louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2019  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same at december 31 2018 eog is committed to deliver fixed quantities of crude oil of 699 mmbbls in 2019 137 mmbbls in 2020 and 14 mmbbls in 2021 all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

in 2018  eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2019  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2018  eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to katy texas east texas the cheyenne hub southern california or chicago illinois pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point in 2019  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same at december 31 2018 eog is committed to deliver fixed quantities of natural gas of 64 bcf in 2019 15 bcf in 2020 10 bcf in 2021 2 bcf in 2022 and 11 bcf thereafter all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves 

  

in 2018  a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices and a fixed price contract the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2019  

in 2018  all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2019  

through november 2018 eog marketed and sold its uk wellhead crude oil production from the conwy field the crude oil sales were based on a dated brent price or other market prices as applicable 

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2018  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues the two purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2018 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation  united states   eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states   local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds voc from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

at the international level in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however the us has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement in response many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 as amended 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  united states   most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

  

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

in november 2016 the blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands though in september 2018 the blm issued a final rule rescinding certain requirements of that rule there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions 

in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation   eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad china and canada as earlier discussed eog sold its united kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report 

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 28 in 2018 and 22 in 2017 and decreased 12 in 2016 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 18 in 2018 55 in 2017 and 1 in 2016 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 31 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2018 inclusive of a positive revenue adjustment of 044 per mcf related to the adoption of asu 201409 a 38 increase in 2017 and a 19 decrease in 2016 each as compared to the immediately preceding year 

due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries the global supply of and demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity exclusive of basis swaps in 2019 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 133 million for net income and 173 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2019 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 29 million for net income and 37 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2019 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2019 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes flooding and other adverse weather events moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2016 crude oil prices substantially declined in addition natural gas and ngl prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014 and such lower prices continued through 2016 while crude oil natural gas and ngl prices improved significantly during 2017 and 2018 the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil natural gas and ngl prices for example during the fourth quarter of 2018 there was a substantial decline in the prices for crude oil and ngls whereas natural gas prices increased significantly during such period as a result there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil natural gas andor ngls will sustain or increase from their current levels and not decline 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which will require us to write down the value of our properties such reserve writedowns and asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in fact the substantial declines in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices that began in 2014 and continued in 2015 and through 2016 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses and our results of operations during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 such declines also adversely affected the trading price of our common stock 

if commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time our financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock in addition we may be required to incur impairment charges andor make downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 



 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing storing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable however the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression storage or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

at the international level in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however the us has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement in response many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in november 2016 however the us bureau of land management blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands in september 2018 the blm issued a final rule rescinding certain requirements of the rule in addition the us epa has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states and hydraulic fracturing  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

tax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation while these specific changes were not included in the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law in december 2017 no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future and if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal state local or nonus taxes including the imposition of or increases in production severance or similar taxes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression storage transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  for example our october 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and certain of its affiliated entities although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 

in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of noncore assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings 

similarly a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to obtain financings our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies the interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned asset purchases or sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering processing compression storage transportation and refining facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological geophysical and engineering evaluation methods 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression storage and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events changes in temperature and precipitation patterns changes to ground and surface water availability and other related phenomena which could affect some or all of our operations our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events such as winter storms flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression storage and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression storage and transportation services such extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial basis swap price swap option swaption and collar contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts at february 19 2019 our forecasted crude oil production excluding basis swap contracts for 2019 and our forecasted natural gas production for 2019 were not hedged as a result our forecasted production for 2019 is subject to fluctuating market prices if we do not hedge additional production volumes for 2019 and beyond we will be impacted by commodity price declines which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the us securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the enduser exception may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties andor may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions and modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats 

we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations 

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption reputational damagecommunication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

reserve information  for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered further the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage  the following table summarizes eogs gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2018  excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 03 million net acres will expire in 2019 05 million net acres will expire in 2020 and 03 million net acres will expire in 2021 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future as of december 31 2018 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with such undeveloped acreage

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized net income of 3419 million during 2018 as compared to net income of 2583 million for 2017 at december 31 2018 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2928 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 401 mmboe from december 31 2017 during 2018 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 330 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 424 billion cubic feet or 71 mmboe in each case from december 31 2017 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2018 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs 

during 2018 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years in addition eog continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins exchanges or tactical acquisitions on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 77 of united states production during 2018 and 2017 during 2018 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the eagle ford play delaware basin play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico north dakota texas utah and wyoming 

trinidad   in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a modified ub block the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited and its successor heritage petroleum company limited in 2018 eog conducted an ocean bottom nodal seismic survey in the secc block and the pelican field and continued to process and review the initial data 

other international  in the sichuan basin sichuan province china eog entered 2018 with two drilled uncompleted wells and completed both wells in addition eog drilled five natural gas wells and completed one of those wells in 2018 as part of the continuing development of the bajiaochang field which natural gas is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina 

in the uk eog produced crude oil from its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy development project eog completed the sale of all of its interest in eog resources united kingdom limited during the fourth quarter of 2018 eog no longer has any presence in the uk 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 24 at december 31 2018 and 28 at december 31 2017 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on october 1 2018 eog repaid upon maturity the 350 million aggregate principal amount of its 6875 senior notes due 2018 

during 2018 eog funded 66 billion 411 million of which was noncash in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 350 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 438 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of 227 million from the sale of assets 

total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 61 billion to 65 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash exchanges the majority of 2019 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings 

management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities

during 2018 operating revenues increased 6067 million or 54 to 17275 million from 11208 million in 2017 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas increased 4039 million or 51 to 11946 million in 2018 from 7907 million in 2017 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2018 were approximately 89 of total wellhead revenues compared to 88 in 2017 during 2018 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million compared to net gains of 20 million in 2017 gathering processing and marketing revenues increased 1932 million during 2018 to 5230 million from 3298 million in 2017 net gains on asset dispositions of 175 million in 2018 were primarily as a result of exchanges of producing properties and acreage in texas and sales of producing properties and acreage in the united kingdom texas and the rocky mountain area compared to net losses on asset dispositions of 99 million in 2017 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 







2018 compared to 2017 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2018 increased 3261 million or 52 to 9517 million from 6256 million in 2017 due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 2088 million and an increase in production 1173 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2018 increased 28 to 6521 per barrel compared to 5091 per barrel in 2017 wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2018 increased 19 to 400 mbbld as compared to 337 mbbld in 2017 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

ngl revenues in 2018 increased 398 million or 55 to 1127 million from 729 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production 229 million and a higher composite average wellhead ngl price 169 million eogs composite average wellhead ngl price increased 18 to 2660 per barrel in 2018 compared to 2261 per barrel in 2017 ngl production in 2018 increased 31 to 116 mbbld as compared to 88 mbbld in 2017 the increased production was primarily in the permian basin and the eagle ford 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2018 increased 380 million or 41 to 1302 million from 922 million in 2017 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price 282 million and an increase in wellhead natural gas deliveries 98 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 28 to 292 per mcf in 2018 compared to 229 per mcf in 2017 this increase in composite wellhead natural gas prices includes a positive revenue adjustment of 044 per mcf related to the adoption of asu 201409 natural gas deliveries in 2018 increased 11 to 1219 mmcfd as compared to 1103 mmcfd in 2017 the increase in production was primarily due to increased production in the united states 158 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production in trinidad 47 mmcfd the increased production in the united states was due primarily to increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and rocky mountain area and higher volumes in the marcellus shale the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2017 

during 2018 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 259 million during 2017 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 20 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 7 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities eog sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs to purchase thirdparty crude oil natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2018 increased 59 million compared to 2017 primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities 

2017 compared to 2016 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased 1939 million or 45 to 6256 million from 4317 million in 2016 due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1124 million and an increase in production 815 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22 to 5091 per barrel compared to 4176 per barrel in 2016 wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19 to 337 mbbld as compared to 283 mbbld in 2016 the increased production was primarily due to higher production in the permian basin and rocky mountain area 

ngl revenues in 2017 increased 292 million or 67 to 729 million from 437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead ngl price 257 million and an increase in production 35 million eogs composite average wellhead ngl price increased 55 to 2261 per barrel in 2017 compared to 1463 per barrel in 2016 the increased production was primarily due to higher production in the permian basin and rocky mountain area partially offset by decreased production in the fort worth barnett shale largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased 180 million or 24 to 922 million from 742 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price 227 million partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 47 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32 to 229 per mcf in 2017 compared to 173 per mcf in 2016 natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6 to 1103 mmcfd as compared to 1175 mmcfd in 2016 the decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the united states 45 mmcfd and trinidad 27 mmcfd the decreased production in the united states was due primarily to lower volumes in the fort worth barnett shale upper gulf coast and south texas areas largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and rocky mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and other affiliated entities collectively the yates entities the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016 

during 2017 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 20 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 7 million during 2016 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 100 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 22 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased 9 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and ngl marketing activities 16 million partially offset by lower margins on sand sales 9 million 

operating and other expenses 

2018 compared to 2017  during 2018 operating expenses of 12806 million were 2524 million higher than the 10282 million incurred during 2017    the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1283 million in 2018 increased 238 million from 1045 million in 2017 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs 171 million higher workover expenditures 44 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses 41 million all in the united states partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the united kingdom 18 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 747 million in 2018 increased 7 million from 740 million in 2017 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the permian basin 116 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the barnett shale 52 million the eagle ford 31 million and the rocky mountain area 25 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2018 increased 26 million to 3435 million from 3409 million in 2017 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2018 were 24 million higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production in the united states 647 million and the united kingdom 21 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 625 million and a decrease in production in trinidad 16 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 427 million in 2018 decreased 7 million from 434 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased professional legal and other services 24 million partially offset by increased employeerelated expenses resulting from expanded operations 15 million and increased information systems costs 10 million 

net interest expense of 245 million in 2018 was 29 million lower than 2017 primarily due to repayment of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2017 in september 2017 25 million and the 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 in october 2018 6 million partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest 3 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets and beginning january 1 2018 natural gas processing fees from third parties eog pays third parties to process a portion of its natural gas production to extract ngls see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion related to eogs adoption of asu 201409 

gathering and processing costs increased 288 million to 437 million in 2018 compared to 149 million in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of asu 201409 204 million and increased operating costs in the permian basin 32 million the united kingdom 28 million and the eagle ford 25 million 

exploration costs of 149 million in 2018 increased 4 million from 145 million in 2017 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses in the united states 7 million partially offset by decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in trinidad 5 million 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2018 and 2017 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2018 increased 227 million to 772 million 65 of wellhead revenues from 545 million 69 of wellhead revenues in 2017 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 190 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and an increase in ad valoremproperty taxes 33 million both in the united states 

other income net was 17 million in 2018 compared to other income net of 9 million in 2017 the increase of 8 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense 12 million and an increase in interest income 4 million partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses 15 million 

eog recognized an income tax provision of 822 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of 1921 million in 2017 primarily due to the absence of certain 2017 tax benefits related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja and higher pretax income the most significant impact of the tcja on eog was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 which required the existing net united states federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit in 2017 of approximately 22 billion the net effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 19 from 291 in the prior year primarily due to the absence of the tcja tax benefits 

2017 compared to 2016  during 2017 operating expenses of 10282 million were 1406 million higher than the 8876 million incurred during 2016    the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below see operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1045 million in 2017 increased 118 million from 927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the united states 71 million and the united kingdom 30 million and higher workover expenditures in the united states 21 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production 

transportation costs of 740 million in 2017 decreased 24 million from 764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the barnett shale and upper gulf coast 85 million and decreased transportation costs in the eagle ford 8 million and the united kingdom 8 million partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the permian basin 47 million and the rocky mountain area 20 million and from the 2016 transactions with the yates entities 13 million 

dda expenses in 2017 decreased 144 million to 3409 million from 3553 million in 2016 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were 141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states 449 million and trinidad 19 million and a decrease in production in the united kingdom 16 million and trinidad 11 million partially offset by an increase in production in the united states 354 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 434 million in 2017 increased 39 million from 395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employeerelated expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the yates entities 45 million and increased professional legal and other services 30 million partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements 42 million 

net interest expense of 274 million in 2017 was 8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2017 in september 2017 11 million partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest 4 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 26 million to 149 million in 2017 compared to 123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the permian basin 12 million and the rocky mountain area 8 million 

exploration costs of 145 million in 2017 increased 20 million from 125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in trinidad 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016 eog recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of 61 million related to obsolete inventory and 138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested haynesville natural gas assets 

taxes other than income in 2017 increased 195 million to 545 million 69 of wellhead revenues from 350 million 64 of wellhead revenues in 2016 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 171 million and in ad valoremproperty taxes 18 million both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 

other income net was 9 million in 2017 compared to other expense net of 51 million in 2016 the increase of 60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 49 million and interest income 5 million 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 1921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of 461 million in 2016 primarily due to the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 the most significant impact of the tcja on eog was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 which required the existing net united states federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately 22 billion due largely to this tax rate reduction the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 291 from 30 in the prior year

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 24 at december 31 2018 compared to 28 at december 31 2017 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively eog had outstanding 6040 million and 6390 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of 6027 million and 6602 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2018 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2018 was 208 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2018 the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were 8 million during the year 2018 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2018  in thousands 





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2018 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad china and canada and through november 2018 the uk the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2018 was the british pound eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2019 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 19 2019 the average 2019 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 5715 per barrel and 289 per mmbtu respectively representing a decrease of 12 for crude oil and a decrease of 6 for natural gas from the average nymex prices in 2018 see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity exclusive of basis swaps in 2019 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 133 million for net income and 173 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2019 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 29 million for net income and 37 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 19 2019 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford delaware basin and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs 

  

the total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures of approximately 61 billion to 65 billion excluding acquisitions and noncash exchanges is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development   and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations  in 2019 both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2018 levels in 2019 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are expensed as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2018 west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 2619 per barrel to 10795 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 149 per mmbtu to 815 per mmbtu eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for west texas intermediate crude oil and henry hub natural gas in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules in the future if any combination of crude oil prices natural gas prices actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility in the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the united kingdom uk the peoples republic of china china canada and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10‑q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is wwweogresourcescom information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this report 

at december 31 2017  eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2527 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1313 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 503 mmbbl were natural gas liquids ngls reserves and 4263 billion cubic feet bcf or 711 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 97 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 2 in trinidad and 1 in other international areas crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

as of december 31 2017  eog employed approximately 2664 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries pursuant to this strategy each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog is focused on costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drill bits completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2017  on a crude oil equivalent basis 54 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 20 were ngls and 26 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio 

the following is a summary of significant developments during 2017  and certain 2018  plans for eogs united states operations 





 

the eagle ford continues to prove itself as a worldclass crude oil field having produced in excess of 20 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate with approximately 520000 of its 582000 total net acres in the prolific oil window eog continues to be the largest crude oil producer in the eagle ford with cumulative gross production in excess of 420 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate in 2017 eog completed 217 net eagle ford wells and continued to test the austin chalk play concept with the completion of 28 net austin chalk wells eog is still evaluating the extent of prospectivity of the austin chalk which overlays the eagle ford eog also expanded its enhanced oil recovery eor gas injection program in 2017 adding 56 wells to the program based on encouraging results eog plans to include an additional 90 wells in 2018 bringing the total number of wells in its eor program to 178 by year end in 2018 eog expects to complete approximately 260 net eagle ford wells and 25 net austin chalk wells while continuing to improve well productivity and operational efficiencies the combination of selfsourced sand dedicated completions crews and other services along with continuous well optimization programs have made this play a centerpiece of eogs portfolio 

in the permian basin eog completed 172 net wells during 2017 primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale second bone spring and leonard plays eog continued to consolidate its acreage position in each of these worldclass assets through small leasing transactions and the exchange of acreage with other nearby operators in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale play where it has approximately 346000 net acres eog followed a development plan with well spacing as close as 500 feet in the crude oil portion and 880 feet in the combo portion the success of the 2017 wolfcamp program was due to precision targeting highdensity stimulations cost reductions and lateral length extensions the average lateral length of completed wells in the play increased from approximately 5200 feet in 2016 to approximately 6100 feet in 2017 the highreturn delaware basin wolfcamp shale play where eog completed 116 net wells in 2017 will continue to be an area of focus in 2018 in the second bone spring play eog holds approximately 289000 net acres and completed 26 net wells in 2017 with over 1800 estimated remaining net drilling locations the second bone spring play is another integral part of eogs permian basin portfolio in the leonard shale play eog has approximately 160000 net acres and continued development with 20 net wells completed in 2017 eog also announced the addition of a new highreturn target in the delaware basin first bone spring oil play where it holds 100000 net prospective acres in 2017 eog had consistent results in the first bone spring completing nine net wells and estimates that it has over 540 net locations remaining activity in 2018 will continue to be focused in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale second bone spring first bone spring and leonard plays where eog expects to complete approximately 230 net wells 

activity in the rocky mountain area increased in 2017 with a focus on the completion of the remaining legacy drilled uncompleted wells ducs in the williston basin bakken and continued development of the powder river and dj basins in the powder river basin eog continued to expand its development programs in the turner and parkman formations as well as test new horizons with consistent results and strong returns in 2017 the powder river basin will again be a focal point for eog in 2018 in the wyoming dj basin drilling completion and operating costs continued to be driven down and there is a significant highreturn development program scheduled for 2018 activity in the williston basin bakken for 2017 was mainly limited to completing ducs and will shift to drilling and completing new wells starting in the summer of 2018 eog currently holds approximately 12 million net acres in the rocky mountain area 

in the midcontinent area eog proved the prospectivity of the woodford oil window play with two net wells during 2017 eog holds 50000 net acres in the play with plans to continue development in 2018 also in the area eog executed a joint venture agreement in the western anadarko basin marmaton sand play in 2017 eog drilled 18 gross wells and completed 10 gross wells as operator of the joint venture eog divested 8335 net acres with daily average production of 1231 barrels of oil equivalent per day boed in the midcontinent area eog plans to build on its initial success in the woodford oil window with an expanded campaign of 25 net well completions in 2018 continued development in the joint venture in the western anadarko basin is also planned 

total net production in 2017 from the fort worth basin barnett shale averaged 3 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 16 mbbld of ngls and 94 mmcfd of natural gas at yearend 2017 eog held approximately 169000 net acres in the fort worth basin in 2017 eog divested 57000 net acres and 137 net wells in the fort worth basin barnett shale average daily production volumes associated with the sale were 55 mmcfd of natural gas 

in 2017 four ducs were completed in the marcellus shale average initial production for the four wells was over 10 mmcfd in 2018 eog expects to complete 12 ducs eog currently holds approximately 177000 net acres with marcellus and utica shale potential 

the upper gulf coast area had limited drilling activity in 2017 eog focused on portfolio enhancement through an active exploration and evaluation program this is expected to continue in 2018 

in the south texas area eog drilled four net liquidsrich natural gas wells in 2017 completed two and deferred additional completions until 2018 eog expects to complete approximately 12 net liquidsrich natural gas wells in 2018 in the frio and vicksburg trends where it holds approximately 238000 net acres in addition exploration and evaluation efforts will continue in this region in 2018 

at december 31 2017 eog held approximately 22 million net undeveloped acres in the united states

in 2017  eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline or truck to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major us sales areas included the midwest the permian basin cushing oklahoma louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2018  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2017  eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2018  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2017  eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point in 2018  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

  

in 2017  a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2018  

in december 2014 eog put in place arrangements to market and sell its uk wellhead crude oil production from the conwy field which commenced production in march 2016 the crude oil sales are based on a dated brent price or other market prices as applicable 

in 2017  all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2018  

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2017  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues the two purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production   crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

  

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2017 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states  local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in june 2017 the us epa proposed to stay certain requirements of that rule for two years 

also in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however in june 2017 the us president indicated that the us will withdraw from the paris agreement 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 as amended 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

  

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in june 2017 the us epa proposed to stay certain requirements of that rule for two years 

in november 2016 the blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands in december 2017 the blm temporarily suspended or delayed certain requirements of that rule until january 17 2019 there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions 

in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china and canada eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report 

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas consistent with eogs 2016 production crude oil and condensate and ngl production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2017 than in prior years average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 22 in 2017 and decreased 12 in 2016 and 49 in 2015 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 55 in 2017 and 1 in 2016 and decreased 54 in 2015 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 38 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2017 a 19 decrease in 2016 and a 50 decrease in 2015 each as compared to the immediately preceding year 

due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries the global supply of and demand for crude oil and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2018 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2018 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 82 million for net income and 106 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2018 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of call options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2018 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 22 million for net income and 29 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2018 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2018 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes flooding and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors   

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 



 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2016 crude oil prices substantially declined in addition natural gas and ngl prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014 and such lower prices continued during 2016 while crude oil natural gas and ngl prices improved notably during 2017 the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil natural gas and ngl prices as a result there can be no assurance of further commodity price increases nor can there be any assurance that current commodity prices will be sustained or that the prices for crude oil natural gas andor ngls will not again decline 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically substantial declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which will require us to write down the value of our properties such reserve writedowns and asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in fact the substantial declines in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices that began in 2014 and continued in 2015 and through 2016 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses and our results of operations during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 such declines also adversely affected the trading price of our common stock 

if commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time our financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock in addition we may be required to incur impairment charges andor make significant additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 



 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in june 2017 the us epa proposed to stay certain requirements of that rule for two years in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 however in june 2017 the us president indicated that the us will withdraw from the paris agreement 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in november 2016 however the us bureau of land management blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands in december 2017 the blm temporarily suspended or delayed certain requirements of that rule until january 17 2019 in addition the us epa has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states and hydraulic fracturing  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

tax laws and regulations may change over time and additional regulatory guidance or changes in eogs assumptions and interpretations in respect of the recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the us president signed into law a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja that significantly changes the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tcja among other things i permanently reduces the us corporate income tax rate ii repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax amt iii provides for the refund of amt credits over a fouryear period beginning in 2018 iv revises the us federal taxation of foreign earnings v imposes a tax on the deemed repatriation of existing foreign earnings that is payable over an eightyear period beginning in 2017 and vi provides for other changes to the taxation of corporations including changes to cost recovery rules the utilization of net operating losses and the deductibility of interest expense each of which may impact the taxation of oil and gas companies the tcja is complex and farreaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us the ultimate impact of the tcja may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in interpretations or assumptions could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition see note 6 to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in addition from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws including the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs while these specific changes are not included in the tcja no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be the elimination of certain us federal tax deductions as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal state local or nonus taxes including the imposition of or increases in production severance or similar taxes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  for example our october 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and certain of its affiliated entities although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of noncore assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions and a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain financings our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned asset purchases or sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts at february 20 2018 our forecasted crude oil production for 2018 is approximately 34 hedged at approximately 6004 per barrel excluding basis swap contracts and our forecasted natural gas production for 2018 is approximately 12 hedged at approximately 296 per million british thermal units excluding call option contracts as a result a portion of our forecasted production for 2018 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2018 and beyond we will be impacted by further commodity price declines which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the enduser exception may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties andor may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats 

as a producer of crude oil and natural gas we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations 

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information  for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage  the following table summarizes eogs developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2017  excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 02 million net acres will expire in 2018 03 million net acres will expire in 2019 and 04 million net acres will expire in 2020 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future as of december 31 2017 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with such undeveloped acreage 

productive well summary  the following table represents eogs gross and net productive wells including 509 wells in which we hold a royalty interest 





 

drilling and acquisition activities  during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  eog expended 44 billion 64 billion and 49 billion respectively for exploratory and development drilling facilities and acquisition of leases and producing properties including asset retirement obligations of 56 million 20 million and 53 million respectively included in the 2016 expenditures was 39 billion of acquisitions of producing properties and leases in connection with the 2016 merger and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and other affiliated entities the following tables set forth the results of the gross crude oil and natural gas wells completed for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



the following tables set forth the results of the net crude oil and natural gas wells completed for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



eog participated in the drilling of wells that were in the process of being drilled or completed at the end of the period as set out in the table below for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



included in the previous table of wells in progress at the end of the period were wells which had been drilled but were not completed ducs the following table sets forth eogs ducs for which proved undeveloped reserves had been booked as of the end of each period 



in order to effectively manage its capital expenditures and to provide flexibility in managing its drilling rig and well completion schedules eog from time to time will have an inventory of ducs at december 31 2017  there were approximately 67 mmboe of net proved undeveloped reserves associated with eogs inventory of ducs under eogs current drilling plan all such ducs are expected to be completed within five years from the original booking date of such reserves 

eog acquired wells which includes the acquisition of additional interests in certain wells in which eog previously owned an interest as set out in the tables below for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



  

all of eogs drilling and completion activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors eogs other property plant and equipment primarily includes gathering transportation and processing infrastructure assets crudebyrail assets and sand mine and sand processing assets which support eogs exploration and production activities eog does not own drilling rigs hydraulic fracturing equipment or rail cars 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

see the information set forth under the contingencies caption in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference herein 

as previously reported by eog resources inc eog in its forms 10q for the quarterly periods ended june 30 2017 and september 30 2017 eog executed a consent decree with the north dakota department of health nddoh in july 2017 regarding alleged violations of north dakotas air pollution control laws and related provisions of the federal clean air act the consent decree was subsequently executed by the nddoh and in august 2017 the north dakota district court for the south central judicial district issued its order approving the consent decree and resolving the alleged violations raised therein eogs consent decree generally follows the same format as the consent decrees that the nddoh has negotiated with other north dakota operators 

as previously reported the consent decree provided for a base penalty of 400000 the consent decree further provided that the base penalty could be reduced by up to 60 percent in respect of voluntary leak detection and repair ldar efforts by eog and eogs development and submission of a quality assurancequality control qaqc plan to assist with minimizing air emissions additionally pursuant to the terms of the consent decree eog was eligible to fund a supplemental environmental project sep to offset up to 50 percent of the final penalty amount 

eog qualified for all of the available penalty reductions and the seprelated offset after taking into account such reductions and the seprelated offset eog paid a final penalty of 90375 to the nddoh in november 2017 

the penalty amount paid to the nddoh the expenditures resulting from eogs ldar efforts and development and submission of a qaqc plan and the amount funded for the sep has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on eogs financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized net income of 2583 million during 2017 as compared to a net loss of 1097 million for 2016 at december 31 2017 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2527 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 380 mmboe from december 31 2016 during 2017 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 223 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 945 billion cubic feet or 158 mmboe in each case from december 31 2016 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2017 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs 

during 2017 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling completion and operating efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions these efficiency gains along with certain realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2017 eog continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins exchanges or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 77 of united states production during 2017 as compared to 73 for 2016 during 2017 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the eagle ford play delaware basin play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico north dakota texas utah and wyoming 

trinidad   in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a modified ub block the banyan field and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited in 2017 eog completed and brought online two net wells finishing its program in the sercan area and drilled and completed five additional net wells in the banyan and osprey fields eog conducted a seismic survey in the ua block participated in a seismic survey program with a joint venture partner in the ska mento and reggae area and signed a new multiyear contract under which eog will supply future natural gas volumes to ngc beginning in 2019 

other international  in the united kingdom eog produces crude oil from its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy project beginning in the second quarter of 2017 production in the conwy was offline due to facility improvements and operational issues eog resumed production in the first quarter of 2018 

in the sichuan basin sichuan province china eog drilled five natural gas wells and completed four of those wells in 2017 as part of the continuing development of the bajiaochang field which natural gas is sold under a longterm contract to petrochina 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

tax cuts and jobs act 

in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tcja which made significant changes to united states federal income tax law under the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification the effects of new legislation are recognized upon enactment accordingly recognition of the tax effects of the tcja is required in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements the tcja made several changes to united states corporate income tax laws some of which will have a material impact on eogs tax provision for 2017 and subsequent periods including the reduction in the statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the conversion to the territorial system of taxation of foreign earnings the tcja is expected to reduce eogs effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years though the ultimate impact on its worldwide effective tax rate will depend on the percentage of pretax income generated by eog in the united states as compared to its other jurisdictions 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 at december 31 2017 and 33 at december 31 2016 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on september 15 2017 eog repaid upon maturity the 600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5875 senior notes due 2017 

on february 15 2017 the board of directors approved an amendment to eogs restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of eogs authorized shares of common stock from 640 million to 1280 million eogs stockholders approved the increase at the annual meeting of stockholders on april 27 2017 and the amendment was filed with the delaware secretary of state on april 28 2017 

during 2017 eog funded 46 billion 282 million of which was noncash property exchanges in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 600 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 387 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of 227 million from the sale of assets 

total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 54 billion to 58 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2018 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

net operating revenues and other 

during 2017 net operating revenues increased 3557 million or 47 to 11208 million from 7651 million in 2016 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas increased 2411 million or 44 to 7908 million in 2017 from 5497 million in 2016 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2017 were approximately 88 of total wellhead revenues compared to 86 in 2016 during 2017 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 20 million compared to net losses of 100 million in 2016 gathering processing and marketing revenues increased 1332 million during 2017 to 3298 million from 1966 million in 2016 net losses on asset dispositions of 99 million in 2017 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in texas and the rocky mountain area compared to net gains on asset dispositions of 206 million in 2016 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 







2017 compared to 2016 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased 1939 million or 45 to 6256 million from 4317 million in 2016 due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1124 million and an increase in production 815 million eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22 to 5091 per barrel compared to 4176 per barrel in 2016 wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19 to 337 mbbld as compared to 283 mbbld in 2016 the increased production was primarily due to higher production in the permian basin and rocky mountain area 

ngl revenues in 2017 increased 292 million or 67 to 729 million from 437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead ngl price 257 million and an increase in production 35 million eogs composite average wellhead ngl price increased 55 to 2261 per barrel in 2017 compared to 1463 per barrel in 2016 the increased production was primarily due to higher production in the permian basin and rocky mountain area partially offset by decreased production in the fort worth barnett shale largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased 180 million or 24 to 922 million from 742 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price 227 million partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 47 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32 to 229 per mcf in 2017 compared to 173 per mcf in 2016 natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6 to 1103 mmcfd as compared to 1175 mmcfd in 2016 the decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the united states 45 mmcfd and trinidad 27 mmcfd the decreased production in the united states was due primarily to lower volumes in the fort worth barnett shale upper gulf coast and south texas areas largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and rocky mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and other affiliated entities collectively the yates entities the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016 

during 2017 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 20 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 7 million during 2016 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 100 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 22 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities eog sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs to purchase thirdparty crude oil natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased 9 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and ngl marketing activities 16 million partially offset by lower margins on sand sales 9 million 

2016 compared to 2015 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased 618 million or 13 to 4317 million from 4935 million in 2015 due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12 to 4176 per barrel compared to 4753 per barrel in 2015 wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1 to 283 mbbld as compared to 284 mbbld in 2015 the decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the eagle ford and the rocky mountain area largely offset by increased production in the permian basin 

ngl revenues in 2016 increased 29 million or 7 to 437 million from 408 million in 2015 due to an increase of 5 mbbld or 6 in ngl deliveries primarily as a result of increased production in the permian basin 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased 319 million or 30 to 742 million from 1061 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 246 million and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 73 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25 to 173 per mcf in 2016 compared to 230 per mcf in 2015 natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7 to 1175 mmcfd as compared to 1265 mmcfd in 2015 the decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the united states 76 mmcfd the decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the fort worth barnett shale upper gulf coast and south texas areas largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and the acquisition of the yates entities 

during 2016 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 100 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 22 million during 2015 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 730 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased 91 million compared to 2015 primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales 

operating and other expenses 

2017 compared to 2016  during 2017 operating expenses of 10282 million were 1406 million higher than the 8876 million incurred during 2016    the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below see net operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1045 million in 2017 increased 118 million from 927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the united states 71 million and the united kingdom 30 million and higher workover expenditures in the united states 21 million lease and well expenses increased in the united states primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 740 million in 2017 decreased 24 million from 764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the barnett shale and upper gulf coast 85 million and decreased transportation costs in the eagle ford 8 million and the united kingdom 8 million partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the permian basin 47 million and the rocky mountain area 20 million and from the 2016 transactions with the yates entities 13 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2017 decreased 144 million to 3409 million from 3553 million in 2016 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were 141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states 449 million and trinidad 19 million and a decrease in production in the united kingdom 16 million and trinidad 11 million partially offset by an increase in production in the united states 354 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 434 million in 2017 increased 39 million from 395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employeerelated expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the yates entities 45 million and increased professional legal and other services 30 million partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements 42 million 

net interest expense of 274 million in 2017 was 8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2017 in september 2017 11 million partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest 4 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets and certain charges from thirdparty processors 

gathering and processing costs increased 26 million to 149 million in 2017 compared to 123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the permian basin 12 million and the rocky mountain area 8 million 

exploration costs of 145 million in 2017 increased 20 million from 125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in trinidad 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016 eog recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of 61 million related to obsolete inventory and 138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested haynesville natural gas assets 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2017 increased 195 million to 545 million 69 of wellhead revenues from 350 million 64 of wellhead revenues in 2016 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 171 million and in ad valorem property taxes 18 million both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 

other income net was 9 million in 2017 compared to other expense net of 51 million in 2016 the increase of 60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 49 million and interest income 5 million 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 1921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of 461 million in 2016 primarily due to the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 the most significant impact of the tcja on eog was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 which required the existing net united states federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately 22 billion due largely to this tax rate reduction the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 291 from 30 in the prior year see note 6 to consolidated financial statements for a further description of the income tax changes enacted by tcja affecting eog 

2016 compared to 2015  during 2016 operating expenses of 8876 million were 6568 million lower than the 15444 million incurred during 2015    operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million primarily due to commodity price declines the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below see net operating revenues and other above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 927 million in 2016 decreased 255 million from 1182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs 218 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses 35 million both in the united states 

transportation costs of 764 million in 2016 decreased 85 million from 849 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 55 million the barnett shale 21 million the eagle ford 19 million and the upper gulf coast region 10 million primarily due to lower production and service cost reductions in these regions partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the permian basin 18 million 

dda expenses in 2016 increased 239 million to 3553 million from 3314 million in 2015 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were 247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the united states 300 million and china 3 million and commencement of crude oil production from the conwy field in the united kingdom 22 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united states 68 million and trinidad 4 million and lower unit rates in trinidad 6 million unit rates in the united states increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at december 31 2015 as a result of lower commodity prices 

ga expenses of 395 million in 2016 increased 28 million from 367 million in 2015 primarily due to employeerelated expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the yates transaction 

net interest expense of 282 million in 2016 was 45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in january 2016 43 million as well as a decrease in capitalized interest 10 million this was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in february 2016 and june 2015 16 million 

gathering and processing costs decreased 23 million to 123 million in 2016 compared to 146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the eagle ford 16 million and the barnett shale 7 million 

exploration costs of 125 million in 2016 decreased 24 million from 149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures 15 million and lower exploration administrative expenses 14 million partially offset by higher delay rentals 5 million all in the united states 

the following table represents impairments for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015 impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eogs estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015 eog recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of 61 million related to obsolete inventory and 138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested haynesville natural gas assets 

taxes other than income in 2016 decreased 72 million to 350 million 64 of wellhead revenues from 422 million 66 of wellhead revenues in 2015 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valoremproperty taxes 49 million and in severanceproduction taxes 34 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues both in the united states these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to eog in 2016 for texas highcost gas severance tax rate reductions 12 million 

other expense net was 51 million in 2016 compared to other income net of 2 million in 2015 the increase of 53 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and increased deferred compensation expense 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of 2397 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments the net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30 from 35 in the prior year primarily due to additional trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 43 million 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash flow 

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures other property plant and equipment expenditures repayments of debt dividend payments to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans 

2017 compared to 2016   net cash provided by operating activities of 4265 million in 2017 increased 1906 million from 2359 million in 2016 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues 2411 million and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 30 million partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses 362 million an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 228 million an increase in net cash paid for interest expense 23 million and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 10 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 3987 million in 2017 increased by 2734 million from 1253 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties 1461 million a decrease in proceeds from asset sales 892 million unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities 246 million and an increase in additions to other property plant and equipment 80 million

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions 





 

exploration and development expenditures of 4384 million for 2017 were 2081 million lower than the prior year the decrease was primarily due to decreased leasehold acquisitions 2790 million and decreased property acquisitions 676 million partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states 1052 million trinidad 106 million and other international 17 million increased facilities expenditures 200 million and increased geological and geophysical expenditures 20 million the 2017 exploration and development expenditures of 4384 million included 3661 million in development drilling and facilities 623 million in exploration 73 million in property acquisitions and 27 million in capitalized interest the 2016 exploration and development expenditures of 6465 million included 3351 million in exploration 2334 million in development drilling and facilities 749 million in property acquisitions and 31 million in capitalized interest the 2015 exploration and development expenditures of 4875 million included 4007 million in development drilling and facilities 481 million in property acquisitions 345 million in exploration and 42 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 

derivative transactions 

commodity derivative contracts   prices received by eog for its crude oil production generally vary from us new york mercantile exchange nymex west texas intermediate prices due to adjustments for delivery location basis and other factors eog has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in midland texas and cushing oklahoma midland differential presented below is a comprehensive summary of eogs midland differential basis swap contracts through february 20 2018 the weighted average price differential expressed in dollars per barrel bbl represents the amount of reduction to cushing oklahoma prices for the notional volumes expressed in barrels per day bbld covered by the basis swap contracts 



eog has entered into additional crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in the us gulf coast and cushing oklahoma gulf coast differential presented below is a comprehensive summary of eogs gulf coast differential basis swap contracts through february 20 2018 the weighted average price differential expressed in bbl represents the amount of addition to cushing oklahoma prices for the notional volumes expressed in bbld covered by the basis swap contracts

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 at december 31 2017 compared to 33 at december 31 2016 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively eog had outstanding 6390 million and 6990 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of 6602 million and 7190 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2017 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2017 was 803 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2017 the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were 84 million during the year 2017 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2017  in thousands 





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2017 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad the united kingdom china and canada the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2017 was the british pound eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2018 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 20 2018 the average 2018 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 6075 per barrel and 281 per mmbtu respectively representing an increase of 19 for crude oil and a decrease of 9 for natural gas from the average nymex prices in 2017 see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2018 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of basis swaps and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2018 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 82 million for net income and 106 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2018 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of call options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2018 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 22 million for net income and 29 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2018 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford delaware basin and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs 

  

the total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures of approximately 54 billion to 58 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development   and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations  in 2018 both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2017 levels in 2018 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2017 west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 2619 per barrel to 11062 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 149 per mmbtu to 815 per mmbtu eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for west texas intermediate crude oil and henry hub natural gas in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules in the future if any combination of crude oil natural gas prices actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

in december 2017 the us enacted the tcja which made significant changes to us federal income tax law shortly after enactment of the tcja the united states securities and exchange commissions sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118   which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tcja under sab 118 an entity would use a similar approach as the measurement period provided in the business combinations topic of the asc an entity will recognize those matters for which the accounting can be completed for matters that have not been completed the entity would either 1 recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information becomes available or 2 for any specific income tax effects of the tcja for which a reasonable estimate cannot be determined continue to apply the income taxes topic of the asc on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the tcja was signed into law eog has prepared its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with the income taxes topic of the asc as allowed by sab 118 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss

at december 31 2016  eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2147 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 1178 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 416 mmbbl were natural gas liquids ngls reserves and 3318 billion cubic feet bcf or 553 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 97 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states and 3 in trinidad crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

as of december 31 2016  eog employed approximately 2650 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog is focused on costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drill bits completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states with a focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2016  on a crude oil equivalent basis 56 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 20 were ngls and 24 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2016 and certain 2017 plans for eogs united states operations

argentina  eogs investment in argentina was sold during the third quarter of 2016 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

in 2016  eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline or truck to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major us sales areas included the midwest the permian basin cushing oklahoma louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2017  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2016  eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2017  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2016  eogs united states wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing was based on the spot market at the ultimate sales point in 2017  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

  

in 2016  a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2017  

in december 2014 eog put in place arrangements to market and sell its uk wellhead crude oil production from the conwy field which commenced production in march 2016 the crude oil sales are based on a dated brent price or other market prices as applicable 

in 2016  all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2017  

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues all three purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations for wellhead volumes on a perday basis 







 

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production   crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

  

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota crude oil rail unloading facilities in oklahoma and louisiana and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail operations and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes eog did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2016 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

  

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and as discussed further below is also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions the us epa has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act also in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 it remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 us election could impact the regulation of ghg emissions at the federal and state level 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations 

  

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in april 2012 however the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

in march 2015 the blm issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and indian lands including requirements for chemical disclosure wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water those regulations were set aside by a federal district court in june 2016 but are on appeal to the 10th circuit court of appeals in addition in november 2016 the blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions 

in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china and canada eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report 

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas consistent with eogs 2015 production crude oil and condensate and ngl production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2016 than in historical prior years average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 12 in 2016 49 in 2015 and 11 in 2014 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states increased 1 in 2016 and decreased 54 in 2015 and 2 in 2014 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 19 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2016 a 50 decrease in 2015 and an 18 increase in 2014 each as compared to the immediately preceding year due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the organization of petroleum exporting countries the global supply of and demand for crude oil and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2017 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2017 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 77 million for net income and 96 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2017 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2017 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 12 million for net income and 15 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2017 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 see note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2017 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors   

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and the substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had and may continue to have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

 

governmental actions may also affect crude oil natural gas and ngl prices it is uncertain what impact the election of the new administration and the new congress will have on the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and ngls 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2016 crude oil prices substantially declined in addition natural gas and ngl prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014 and such lower prices continued during 2016 the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil natural gas and ngl prices as a result we cannot predict how long these lower prices will continue and while commodity prices increased somewhat during 2016 from 2014 and 2015 levels there can be no assurance of further andor sustained price increases or that the prices for crude oil natural gas andor ngls will not again decline 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically substantial declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves as a result prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations liquidity and ability to finance our capital expenditures and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which will require us to write down the value of our properties such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in fact the substantial declines in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices that began in 2014 and continued in 2015 and into 2016 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses and our results of operations during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 

if commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time our financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock in addition we may be required to incur impairment charges andor make significant additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations will be further adversely affected 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in addition in may 2016 the us epa issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions the paris agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 it remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 us election could impact the regulation of ghg emissions at the federal and state level 

it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in march 2015 however the us bureau of land management blm issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and indian lands including requirements for chemical disclosure wellbore integrity and handling of flow back and produced water those regulations were set aside by a federal district court in june 2016 but are on appeal to the 10th circuit court of appeals in november 2016 the blm issued a final rule that limits venting flaring and leaking of natural gas from oil and gas wells and equipment on federal and indian lands in addition there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states and hydraulic fracturing  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may cease to be available in the future or may be otherwise modified as a result of future legislation 

legislation may be proposed in the future that could if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws such changes may include but not be limited to the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation we can give no assurance whether such changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed and if enacted how soon any such changes would become effective the enactment of any such changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  for example our october 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation and certain of its affiliated entities although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of noncore assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions and a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain financings and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned asset purchases or sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices in february 2016 standard  poor’s ratings services and moody’s investors service inc each an independent credit rating agency as a result of their lowered assumptions with respect to future commodity prices each lowered its credit ratings of several investment graderated us oil and gas exploration and production companies including its rating of our longterm debt such ratings downgrades could increase our borrowing costs and may adversely impact our ability to access financings in addition we cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be further lowered 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally while weakened in recent years have improved somewhat however there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and a depressed commodity price environment and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts our forecasted crude oil production for 2017 is currently approximately 5 hedged at approximately 5004 per barrel and our forecasted natural gas production for 2017 is currently approximately 30 hedged at approximately 307 per million british thermal units as a result a portion of our forecasted production for 2017 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2017 and beyond we will be impacted by further commodity price declines which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the enduser exception may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties andor may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation including modifications to or withdrawal from international trade treaties the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats 

as a producer of crude oil and natural gas we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations 

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information  for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage  the following table summarizes eogs developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2016  excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 



most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 03 million net acres will expire in 2017 02 million net acres will expire in 2018 and 02 million net acres will expire in 2019 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future as of december 31 2016 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with such undeveloped acreage

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized a net loss of 1097 million during 2016 as compared to a net loss of 4525 million for 2015 at december 31 2016 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2147 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 29 mmboe from december 31 2015 during 2016 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 113 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 508 billion cubic feet or 84 mmboe 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2016 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs 

during 2016 eog continued to focus on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions these efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2016 eog continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects on a volumetric basis as calculated using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 73 of united states production during 2016 as compared to 71 for 2015 during 2016 drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the eagle ford play delaware basin play and rocky mountain area eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico north dakota texas utah and wyoming 

on october 4 2016 eog completed its previously announced mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation ypc abo petroleum corporation abo myco industries inc myco and certain affiliated entities collectively with ypc abo and myco the yates entities the yates entities had recent net production of approximately 28600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 48 crude oil the assets of the yates entities include 16 million total net acres with approximately 180000 net acres in the delaware basin core approximately 200000 net acres in the powder river basin and approximately 130000 net acres in the permian basin northwest shelf the financial results of ypc abo and myco were included in eogs consolidated financial statements beginning october 4 2016 

trinidad   in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a and modified ub block and the sercan area formerly known as the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited in the third quarter of 2016 eog installed a platform and pipeline in the sercan area in preparation for its three net well drilling program in the fourth quarter of 2016 eog drilled and completed one net well and began drilling a second well eog expects to bring the remaining two net wells of the sercan program online in early 2017 and to drill three additional net wells in the second half of 2017 

other international  in the united kingdom eog began production from its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil project in march 2016 selling its first crude oil cargo at the end of the first quarter modifications to the nearby thirdpartyowned douglas platform which is used to process conwy production were completed in the first quarter of 2016 and acceptance and performance testing is ongoing 

in the sichuan basin sichuan province china eog plans to drill and complete four wells in 2017 

during the third quarter of 2016 eog successfully completed the sale of all its argentina assets 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 33 at december 31 2016 and 34 at december 31 2015 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

on october 4 2016 in connection with the mergers and related asset purchase transactions with the yates entities eog issued an aggregate of approximately 25 million shares of eog common stock subject to the terms of the agreements and paid to certain of the sellers under the asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately 16 million in cash for total consideration transferred of approximately 24 billion in addition under the terms of the agreements eog assumed and repaid approximately 164 million of debt owed by the yates entities which was offset by approximately 70 million of cash of the yates entities 

at december 31 2016 the 600 million aggregate principal amount of eogs 5875 senior notes due 2017 were reclassified as longterm debt based upon its intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other longterm debt 

on february 1 2016 eog repaid upon maturity the 400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2500 senior notes due 2016 2016 notes 

on january 14 2016 eog closed its sale of 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 415 senior notes due 2026 and 250 million aggregate principal amount of its 510 senior notes due 2036 collectively the notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning on july 15 2016 net proceeds from the notes offering totaled approximately 991 million and were used to repay the 2016 notes when they matured on february 1 2016 and for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures 

during 2016 eog funded 66 billion 39 billion of which was related to the aforementioned yates transaction in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 564 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 373 million in dividends to common stockholders repaid 260 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and purchased 82 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds of 1119 million from the sale of assets net proceeds from the sale of the notes and 29 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation 

total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 37 billion to 41 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2017 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

net operating revenues 

during 2016 net operating revenues decreased 1106 million or 13 to 7651 million from 8757 million in 2015 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas decreased 907 million or 14 to 5497 million in 2016 from 6404 million in 2015 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2016 were approximately 86 of total wellhead revenues compared to 83 in 2015 during 2016 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 100 million compared to net gains of 62 million in 2015 gathering processing and marketing revenues decreased 287 million during 2016 to 1966 million from 2253 million in 2015 net gains on asset dispositions of 206 million in 2016 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in texas louisiana the rocky mountain area and oklahoma compared to net losses on asset dispositions of 9 million in 2015 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 







2016 compared to 2015 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased 618 million or 13 to 4317 million from 4935 million in 2015 due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12 to 4176 per barrel compared to 4753 per barrel in 2015 wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1 to 283 mbbld as compared to 284 mbbld in 2015 the decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the eagle ford and the rocky mountain area largely offset by increased production in the permian basin 

ngl revenues in 2016 increased 29 million or 7 to 437 million from 408 million in 2015 due to an increase of 5 mbbld or 6 in ngl deliveries primarily as a result of increased production in the permian basin 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased 319 million or 30 to 742 million from 1061 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 246 million and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 73 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25 to 173 per mcf in 2016 compared to 230 per mcf in 2015 natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7 to 1175 mmcfd as compared to 1265 mmcfd in 2015 the decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the united states 76 mmcfd the decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the fort worth barnett shale upper gulf coast and south texas areas largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and the acquisition of the yates entities 

during 2016 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 100 million which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 22 million during 2015 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 730 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased 91 million compared to 2015 primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales 

2015 compared to 2014 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased 4807 million or 49 to 4935 million from 9742 million in 2014 due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 4677 million and a decrease of 5 mbbld or 2 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 131 million the decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the north dakota bakken the fort worth barnett shale area and other international partially offset by increased production in the permian basin and eagle ford the decrease in other international is due to the sale of the canadian assets eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49 to 4753 per barrel compared to 9258 per barrel in 2014 

ngl revenues in 2015 decreased 526 million or 56 to 408 million from 934 million in 2014 due to a lower composite average price 490 million and a decrease of 3 mbbld or 4 in ngl deliveries 36 million eogs composite ngl price in 2015 decreased 55 to 1449 per barrel compared to 3191 per barrel in 2014 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased 855 million or 45 to 1061 million from 1916 million in 2014 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 730 million and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 125 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41 to 230 per mcf in 2015 compared to 388 per mcf in 2014 natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7 to 1265 mmcfd as compared to 1353 mmcfd in 2014 the decrease in production was due to decreased production in other international 40 mmcfd the united states 34 mmcfd and trinidad 14 mmcfd in the united states decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the upper gulf coast fort worth barnett shale and south texas areas partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the eagle ford and permian basin the decline in other international primarily reflects the sale of the canadian assets 

during 2015 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 730 million during 2014 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 834 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 34 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined 53 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales 

operating and other expenses 

2016 compared to 2015  during 2016 operating expenses of 8876 million were 6568 million lower than the 15444 million incurred during 2015    operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million primarily due to commodity price declines the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 927 million in 2016 decreased 255 million from 1182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs 218 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses 35 million both in the united states 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees costs associated with crudebyrail operations the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 764 million in 2016 decreased 85 million from 849 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 55 million the barnett shale 21 million the eagle ford 19 million and the upper gulf coast region 10 million primarily due to lower production and service cost reductions in these regions partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the permian basin 18 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2016 increased 239 million to 3553 million from 3314 million in 2015 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were 247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the united states 300 million and china 3 million and commencement of crude oil production from the conwy field in the united kingdom 22 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united states 68 million and trinidad 4 million and lower unit rates in trinidad 6 million unit rates in the united states increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at december 31 2015 as a result of lower commodity prices 

ga expenses of 395 million in 2016 increased 28 million from 367 million in 2015 primarily due to employeerelated expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the yates transaction 

net interest expense of 282 million in 2016 was 45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in january 2016 43 million as well as a decrease in capitalized interest 10 million this was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in february 2016 and june 2015 16 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets 

gathering and processing costs decreased 23 million to 123 million in 2016 compared to 146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the eagle ford 16 million and the barnett shale 7 million 

exploration costs of 125 million in 2016 decreased 24 million from 149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures 15 million and lower exploration administrative expenses 14 million partially offset by higher delay rentals 5 million all in the united states 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value 

the following table represents impairments of 620 million and 6614 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 in millions 



impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the writedown to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015 impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eogs estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015 eog recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of 61 million related to obsolete inventory and 138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested haynesville natural gas assets 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2016 decreased 72 million to 350 million 64 of wellhead revenues from 422 million 66 of wellhead revenues in 2015 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valoremproperty taxes 49 million and in severanceproduction taxes 34 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues both in the united states these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to eog in 2016 for texas highcost gas severance tax rate reductions 12 million 

other expense net was 51 million in 2016 compared to other income net of 2 million in 2015 the increase of 53 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and increased deferred compensation expense 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of 2397 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments the net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30 from 35 in the prior year primarily due to additional trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 43 million 

2015 compared to 2014  during 2015 operating expenses of 15444 million were 2650 million higher than the 12794 million incurred during 2014    operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million primarily due to commodity price declines the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1182 million in 2015 decreased 234 million from 1416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states 125 million lower lease and well expenses in other international 99 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the united states 21 million partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 12 million 

transportation costs of 849 million in 2015 decreased 123 million from 972 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 81 million and the eagle ford 48 million primarily due to an increase in the use of pipelines to transport crude oil production partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the permian basin 19 million 

dda expenses in 2015 decreased 683 million to 3314 million from 3997 million in 2014 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were 691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states 513 million and trinidad 28 million a decrease in production in the united states 44 million and lower dda expense in other international 104 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 367 million in 2015 were 35 million lower than 2014 primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses 

net interest expense of 237 million in 2015 was 36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in march 2015 28 million as well as a decrease in capitalized interest 15 million this was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in june 2015 and during 2014 11 million 

exploration costs of 149 million in 2015 decreased 35 million from 184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 19 million and lower exploration administrative expenses in other international 10 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets 

impairments of 6614 million in 2015 increased 5870 million from 744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 5959 million primarily due to commodity price declines and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 112 million which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eogs estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom 156 million and argentina 43 million proved property and other asset impairments in the united states were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays eog recorded impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million and 575 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

taxes other than income in 2015 decreased 336 million to 422 million 66 of wellhead revenues from 758 million 60 of wellhead revenues in 2014 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severanceproduction taxes 307 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valoremproperty taxes 17 million both in the united states 

other income net was 2 million in 2015 compared to other expense net of 45 million in 2014 the increase of 47 million was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction losses and decreased deferred compensation expense 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 2397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of 2080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the united states in 2015 the net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35 from 42 in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions 





 

exploration and development expenditures of 6465 million for 2016 were 1590 million higher than the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased leasehold acquisitions 3083 million and increased property acquisitions 268 million partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states 1280 million trinidad 46 million and other international 6 million decreased facilities expenditures 390 million decreased geological and geophysical expenditures 15 million and decreased capitalized interest 11 million the 2016 exploration and development expenditures of 6465 million included 3351 million in exploration 2334 million in development drilling and facilities 749 million in property acquisitions and 31 million in capitalized interest the 2015 exploration and development expenditures of 4875 million included 4007 million in development drilling and facilities 481 million in property acquisitions 345 million in exploration and 42 million in capitalized interest the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of 7709 million included 6804 million in development drilling and facilities 709 million in exploration 139 million in property acquisitions and 57 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 33 at december 31 2016 compared to 34 at december 31 2015 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively eog had outstanding 6990 million and 6390 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of 7190 million and 6524 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2016 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the issuance of the notes proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2016 was 604 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2016 the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were 130 million and zero respectively during the year 2016 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2016  in thousands 





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2016 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad the united kingdom china canada and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2016 was the british pound eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2017 will impact the amount of cash generated from eogs operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 17 2017 the average 2017 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 5416 per barrel and 319 per mmbtu respectively representing increases of 25 and 31 respectively from the average nymex prices in 2016 see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2017 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2017 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 77 million for net income and 96 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2017 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2017 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 12 million for net income and 15 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20 2017 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford delaware basin and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs 

  

the total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures of approximately 37 billion to 41 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development   and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2017 both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2016 levels in 2017 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission sec regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimates of and assumptions regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs development expenditures anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted offers from thirdparty purchasers as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain in addition such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future 

crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2016 west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 2619 per barrel to 11062 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 149 per mmbtu to 815 per mmbtu eog uses the fiveyear nymex futures strip for west texas intermediate crude oil and henry hub natural gas in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12month average price in accordance with sec rules in the future if any combination of crude oil natural gas prices actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

exploration and production 

united states operations 

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states with a current focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2015 on a crude oil equivalent basis 53 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 19 were ngls and 28 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2015 and certain 2016 plans for eogs united states operations 

the eagle ford continues to prove itself as a worldclass oil field having produced in excess of 15 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate with approximately 549000 of its 608000 total net acres in the prolific oil window eog continues to be the largest crude oil producer in the eagle ford with cumulative gross production in excess of 285 mmbbl of oil eog completed 329 net wells in 2015 and net production averaged approximately 209 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls an increase of 3 over 2014 the combination of selfsourced sand dedicated frac crews and other services along with continuous well optimization programs have made this play the centerpiece of eogs portfolio in 2016 eog expects to complete approximately 150 net wells continue to improve well productivity and reduce drilling and completion costs as well as operating expenses 

in the permian basin eog completed 74 net wells primarily in the leonard wolfcamp and second bone spring sand plays during 2015 and evaluated multiple development concepts across these liquidsrich plays in the delaware basin wolfcamp shale play where it has approximately 168000 net acres eog tested 500foot well spacing in both the crude oil and combo portions of this play with positive results the success of the 2015 delaware basin wolfcamp program was due to refined targeting highdensity stimulations and cost reductions which will make the play a focal point of eogs 2016 permian basin program in the second bone spring sand play where it holds approximately 111000 net acres eog tested multiple target zones and well spacing as close as 550 feet with over 1000 estimated remaining net drilling locations this highreturn oil play is another integral part of eogs permian basin portfolio in the leonard shale play eog has approximately 93000 net acres and continued development at 300 to 500 foot well spacing additionally eog has approximately 71000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale within the midland basin net production in the permian basin for 2015 averaged approximately 43 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls an increase of 30 over 2014 net natural gas production increased 27 to approximately 108 million cubic feet per day mmcfd eog holds approximately 415000 net acres throughout the permian basin in 2016 activity will be focused primarily in the delaware basin wolfcamp second bone spring sand and leonard plays by completing approximately 75 net wells 

during 2015 the rocky mountain area experienced reduced activity levels due to lower commodity prices but yielded consistent results in 2015 eog continued infill drilling on its crude oil acreage in the williston basin bakken core completing 25 net wells the 2015 development program also included completing 10 net codell formation wells in the dj basin and 13 net wells in the turner parkman and niobrara formations in the powder river basin infrastructure improvements allowed for a substantial reduction in lease operating expenses and a much higher natural gas recovery improved efficiencies lower service company costs both for drilling and completions and lower lease operating expenses resulted in more profitable wells in this challenging price environment net production for the entire rocky mountain area for 2015 averaged approximately 65 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2016 eog plans to complete approximately 35 net wells primarily in the powder river and williston basins eog holds approximately 985000 net acres in the rocky mountain area 

in the upper gulf coast region eog completed six net wells during 2015 and net production averaged approximately 54 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 4 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2016 eog will continue to defer dry gas drilling in the haynesville shale while working to maintain base production and continue its liquids exploration program eog holds approximately 529000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region and plans to complete approximately five net wells in 2016 

in the midcontinent area eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the pennsylvanian sandstones in the anadarko basin completing five net wells in 2015 during 2015 eogs net production averaged approximately 6 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and approximately 29 mmcfd of natural gas eog holds approximately 250000 net acres throughout the midcontinent area and expects to continue its exploration program in 2016 

during 2015 eog performed limited development of its liquidsrich barnett shale combo play in the fort worth basin completing six net wells in 2015 net production in the barnett shale averaged approximately 27 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and approximately 272 mmcfd of natural gas for 2016 eog will focus on maintaining base production eog currently holds approximately 351000 net acres in the barnett shale 

in the south texas area total net production during 2015 averaged approximately 6 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and approximately 66 mmcfd of natural gas eog completed seven net wells with activity focused in san patricio kleberg and jim wells counties in 2016 eog expects to complete approximately five net wells in the frio and vicksburg trends where it holds approximately 272000 net acres exploration efforts will continue in this region primarily focusing on liquidsrich hydrocarbons 

net production in the marcellus shale for 2015 averaged approximately 24 mmcfd of natural gas eog currently holds approximately 200000 net acres with marcellus and utica shale potential 

eog has agreements with certain crude oil refining companies to deliver an average of 58 mbbld and 9 mbbld of crude oil in 2016 and 2017 respectively to certain refineries eog intends to fulfill these crude oil delivery obligations with its eagle ford production 

at december 31 2015 eog held approximately 20 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2015 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the eagle ford in south texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the permian basin in west texas and new mexico at december 31 2015 eogowned natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford and barnett shale totaled 305 mmcfd and 180 mmcfd respectively 

also during 2015 eog continued to use its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota to transport its williston basin crude oil production during 2015 eog loaded 81 unit trains each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 70000 barrels of crude oil with crude oil for transport to st james louisiana and stroud oklahoma eog has net unloading capacity of 100 mbbld and 90 mbbld at st james and stroud respectively during 2015 a total of 18 crude oil unit trains carrying eog production were received at the crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana which provides access to one of the key markets in the us where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index in addition eog utilized its stroud oklahoma crude oil unloading facility and pipeline to transport 63 unit trainloads of crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub eog believes that its marketing and related logistics processes including crudebyrail facilities provide a competitive advantage giving eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets eog expects to utilize its crudebyrail network when it is advantageous 

eog operates its own sand mine and sand processing plants in hood county texas to reduce costs and to help fulfill eogs sand needs for its well completion operations in texas additionally eog owns a second hood county sand processing plant which processes raw sand from wisconsin and sand sourced from the north texas area as needed 

in 2015 eog continued to process sand from its chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant on an asneeded basis 

eog placed in service an additional sand unloading facility in loving new mexico during the first quarter of 2015 to support well completions in the delaware basin 

during 2015 eog shipped the equivalent of 173 sand unit trains from various sources to support well completions in the eagle ford and other plays 

operations outside the united states 

eog has operations offshore trinidad in the uk east irish sea in the china sichuan basin and in canada and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas 

trinidad  eog through several of its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited 

 

several fields in the secc block modified ua block modified ub block block 4a and the sercan area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary ngc crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited petrotrin in 2015 eogs net production from trinidad averaged approximately 349 mmcfd of natural gas and approximately 09 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

eog completed three net wells in 2015 finishing its secc block and modified ub block drilling program which was initiated in 2014 

in 2016 it is anticipated that eogs trinidad operations will supply approximately 430 mmcfd 290 mmcfd net of natural gas from its existing proved reserves all of the natural gas produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2016 is expected to be supplied to ngc under various contracts with ngc all crude oil and condensate produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2016 is expected to be supplied to petrotrin under various contracts with petrotrin in 2016 eog expects to complete one net well and install infrastructure in the sercan area 

at december 31 2015  eog held approximately 40000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom  eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk owns a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916a located in the southern gas basin of the north sea during 2015  a limited amount of production continued from the valkyrie field in this block production ceased at the end of the third quarter of 2015 and decommissioning is planned for the fourth quarter of 2016 

in 2007 eoguk was awarded a license for two blocks in the east irish sea – blocks 1107b and 11012a in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in the east irish sea block 11012a the well in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field during 2012 and 2013 the conwy production platform and pipelines were installed modifications to the nearby thirdparty owned douglas platform which will be used to process conwy production began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 and 2015 first production from the conwy field is anticipated in march 2016 

in 2015  production averaged less than 01 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom 

at december 31 2015  eog held approximately 7000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

china  in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage in 2015 eog drilled four wells and completed three wells one of which was drilled in 2014 in the sichuan basin sichuan province china the successful completions extended the shaximiao development in the chuan zhong block and provides additional opportunities in the future 

in 2015  production averaged approximately 14 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

canada  during 2014 eog sold all of its assets in manitoba and the majority of its assets in alberta in two separate transactions that closed on or about december 1 2014 eog divested 13 million gross acres 11 million net 97 percent of which were in alberta of the approximate 5800 net producing wells sold 5155 were natural gas in 2015 net production averaged approximately 15 mmcfd of natural gas and less than 01 mbbld of ngls 

argentina  eogs activity in argentina is focused on the vaca muerta oil shale formation in the neuquén province management is currently evaluating options for its investment 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

in 2015  eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline truck or eogs crudebyrail assets to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major us sales areas included the midwest the permian basin cushing oklahoma st james louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2016  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2015  eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2016  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2015  eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing was based on the spot market at the ultimate sales point in 2016  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

  

in 2015  a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2016  

in 2015  all wellhead natural gas volumes from the uk were sold on the spot market in december 2014 eog put in place arrangements to market and sell its uk wellhead crude oil production from the conwy field which is anticipated to begin in march 2016 the crude oil sales will be based on a dated brent price or other market prices as applicable 

in 2015  all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2016  

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues both purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using a ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  







 

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production   crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

  

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm andor the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenue has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 as amended nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and texas crude oil rail unloading facilities in oklahoma and louisiana and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail operations and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

  

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations in addition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions recent us epa rulemaking may result in the regulation of ghg emissions as pollutants under the federal clean air act also in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions if ratified the paris agreement will take effect in 2020 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog reports ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in 2009 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations 

  

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in march 2015 the blm issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and indian lands including requirements for chemical disclosure wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water in addition there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions in april 2012 the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition the us epa recently proposed regulations that would require operators to reduce methane and voc emissions from crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations 

in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china canada and argentina eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report 

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2015 than in prior years average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 49 in 2015 decreased 11 in 2014 and increased 6 in 2013 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngl prices received by eog for production in the united states decreased 54 in 2015 2 in 2014 and 8 in 2013 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 50 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states in 2015 an 18 increase in 2014 and a 32 increase in 2013 each as compared to the immediately preceding year in addition as of february 12 2016 the average 2016 us new york mercantile exchange nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 3497 per barrel and 223 per million british thermal units respectively representing declines of 28 and 17 respectively from the average nymex prices in 2015 due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment for example the actions of other crude oil exporting nations including the 

organization of petroleum exporting countries the global supply of and demand for crude oil and the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2016 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 65 million for net income and 81 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2016 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2016 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 15 million for net income and 18 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 25 2016 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 12 to consolidated financial statements for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 25 2016 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to certain perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors   

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

crude oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile and the substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had and may continue to have a material and adverse effect on us and the trading price of our common stock 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015 and into 2016 crude oil prices have substantially declined in addition natural gas and ngl prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014 and such declines continued during 2015 and into 2016 the abovedescribed factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil natural gas and ngl prices as a result we cannot predict how long these lower prices will continue and there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil natural gas andor ngls will not decline further 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices accordingly the recent substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically substantial declines in the prices of these commodities can also render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects resulting in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves as a result prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations liquidity and ability to finance our capital expenditures and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in addition significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values which will require us to write down the value of our properties such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in fact the substantial declines in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices that began in 2014 and which have continued into 2016 have materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our results of operations during fiscal year 2015 and the trading price of our common stock 

as a result of the decreased cash flow available for capital expenditures we have delayed our drilling and completion plans with respect to certain of our properties these delays may result in impacts to our production volumes as well as cause us to potentially shutin certain wells and incur associated lease payment obligations such commodity price declines also resulted in an impairment charge ie writedown of 63 billion in 2015 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 574 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at december 31 2015 

in addition our 2016 financial condition cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further if commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time or continue to decline we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock further if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further we may be required to incur additional impairment charges andor make significant additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates as a result our financial condition and results of operations will be further adversely affected 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years for example the us epa recently proposed regulations that would require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations in december 2015 the us participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the paris agreement adopted at the conference calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions if ratified the paris agreement will take effect in 2020 it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuel products eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements in march 2015 however the us bureau of land management issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and indian lands including requirements for chemical disclosure wellbore integrity and handling of flow back and produced water in addition there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states and hydraulic fracturing  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

  

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may cease to be available in the future or may be otherwise modified as a result of future legislation 

legislation may be proposed in the future that could if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws such changes may include but not be limited to the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as with respect to the intangible drilling costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation we can give no assurance whether such changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed and if enacted how soon any such changes would become effective the enactment of any such changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of noncore assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows the lower commodity price environment could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned noncore asset sales and divestitures further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions and a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of continued lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain financings and the terms of any financings are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels planned asset purchases or sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels including but not limited to the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices in february 2016 standard  poor’s ratings services an independent credit rating agency as a result of its lowered assumptions with respect to future commodity prices lowered its credit ratings of several investment graderated us oil and gas exploration and production companies including its rating of our longterm debt we expect moody’s investors service inc also an independent credit rating agency will take similar action in the near future with respect to its ratings of our debt and its ratings of the debt of other us oil and gas exploration and production companies such ratings downgrades could increase our borrowing costs and may adversely impact our ability to access financings in addition we cannot provide any assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be further lowered 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally while weakened in recent years have improved somewhat however there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and a depressed commodity price environment and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts our forecasted natural gas production for 2016 is currently approximately 4 hedged at approximately 249 per million british thermal units and none of our forecasted crude oil production for 2016 is currently hedged as a result a significant portion of our forecasted production for 2016 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2016 and beyond we will be impacted by further commodity price declines which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc the securities and exchange commission sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the enduser exception may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties andor may be subject to the position limits rule in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015 less than 1 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats 

as a producer of crude oil and natural gas we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations 

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

reserve information  for estimates and discussions of eogs net proved reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

eog realized a net loss of 4525 million during 2015 as compared to net income of 2915 million for 2014 during 2015 impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets totaling 6326 million 4141 million net of tax were recognized primarily due to the decline in commodity prices at december 31 2015 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2118 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe a decrease of 379 mmboe from december 31 2014 during 2015 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves decreased by 126 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 1517 billion cubic feet or 253 mmboe 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2015 

united states eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs during 2015 eog focused on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oilinplace and reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions these efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects on a volumetric basis as calculated using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 71 of united states production during 2015 consistent with 2014 during 2015 drilling occurred primarily in the eagle ford delaware basin and north dakota bakken plays where eog has built an inventory of uncompleted wells in addition eog continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions farmins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects in 2015 eog completed four transactions to acquire certain proved crude oil properties and related assets in the delaware basin the aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled approximately 400 million eogs major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico north dakota texas utah and wyoming 

during 2015 due to the decline in commodity prices proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the united states were written down to their fair value resulting in pretax impairment charges of 6130 million 3945 million net of tax impairments were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays 

trinidad  in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a and modified ub block and the sercan area formerly known as the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited eog completed three net wells in 2015 finishing its secc block and modified ub block drilling program that was initiated in 2014 in 2016 eog expects to complete one net well and install infrastructure in the sercan area 

other international  as previously reported during the fourth quarter of 2014 eog completed the divestiture of substantially all its assets in canada see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements at the time of the sales production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7050 barrels of crude oil per day 580 barrels of ngls per day and 435 million cubic feet of natural gas per day information related to eogs remaining canadian operations is presented in the other international segment 

in the united kingdom eog continues to make progress in the development of its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil discovery modifications to the nearby thirdparty owned douglas platform which will be used to process conwy production began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 and 2015 first production from the conwy field is anticipated in march 2016 during 2015 eog recognized a pretax impairment charge of 186 million for the conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines 

in 2015 eog drilled four wells and completed three wells one of which was drilled in 2014 in the sichuan basin sichuan province china the successful completions extended the shaximiao development in the chuan zhong block and provides additional opportunities in the future 

eogs activity in argentina is focused on the vaca muerta oil shale formation in the neuquén province management is currently evaluating options for its investment 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 34 at december 31 2015 and 25 at december 31 2014 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity at december 31 2015 400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2500 senior notes due 2016 the 2016 notes and 260 million principal amount of commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as longterm debt based upon eogs intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other longterm debt 

on january 14 2016 eog closed its sale of 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 415 senior notes due 2026 and 250 million aggregate principal amount of its 510 senior notes due 2036 collectively the new notes interest on the new notes is payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning july 15 2016 proceeds from the issuance of the new notes totaled approximately 991 million and were used to repay the 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 notes when such notes came due on february 1 2016 and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of future capital expenditures 

on july 21 2015 eog entered into a new 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 2015 agreement with domestic and foreign lenders banks the 2015 agreement replaced eogs 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which was canceled by eog upon the closing of the 2015 agreement the 2015 agreement has a scheduled maturity date of july 21 2020 and includes an option for eog to extend on up to two occasions the term for successive oneyear periods subject to certain terms and conditions the 2015 agreement commits the banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of 20 billion at any one time outstanding with an option for eog to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed 30 billion subject to certain terms and conditions 

on june 1 2015 eog repaid upon maturity the 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 295 senior notes due 2015 

on march 17 2015 eog closed its sale of 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 315 senior notes due 2025 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 390 senior notes due 2035 together the notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning on october 1 2015 net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately 990 million were used for general corporate purposes 

during 2015 eog funded 52 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid at maturity 500 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 367 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 49 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds from the sale of the notes commercial paper borrowings net proceeds of 193 million from the sale of assets and 26 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation 

total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 24 billion to 26 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2016 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under the 2015 agreement and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

net operating revenues 

during 2015 net operating revenues decreased 9278 million or 51 to 8757 million from 18035 million in 2014 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas decreased 6188 million or 49 to 6404 million in 2015 from 12592 million in 2014 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2015 were approximately 83 of total wellhead revenues compared to 85 in 2014 during 2015 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million compared to net gains of 834 million in 2014 gathering processing and marketing revenues decreased 1793 million during 2015 to 2253 million from 4046 million in 2014 net losses on asset dispositions totaled 9 million in 2015 compared to net gains on asset dispositions of 508 million in 2014 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 





 32 

2015 compared to 2014 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased 4807 million or 49 to 4935 million from 9742 million in 2014 due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 4677 million and a decrease of 5 mbbld or 2 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 131 million the decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the north dakota bakken the fort worth barnett shale area and other international partially offset by increased production in the permian basin and eagle ford the decrease in other international is due to the sale of the canadian assets eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49 to 4753 per barrel compared to 9258 per barrel in 2014 

ngl revenues in 2015 decreased 526 million or 56 to 408 million from 934 million in 2014 due to a lower composite average price 490 million and a decrease of 3 mbbld or 4 in ngl deliveries 36 million eogs composite ngl price in 2015 decreased 55 to 1449 per barrel compared to 3191 per barrel in 2014 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased 855 million or 45 to 1061 million from 1916 million in 2014 primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price 730 million and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries 125 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41 to 230 per mcf in 2015 compared to 388 per mcf in 2014 natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7 to 1265 mmcfd as compared to 1353 mmcfd in 2014 the decrease in production was due to decreased production in other international 40 mmcfd the united states 34 mmcfd and trinidad 14 mmcfd in the united states decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the upper gulf coast fort worth barnett shale and south texas areas partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the eagle ford and permian basin the decline in other international primarily reflects the sale of the canadian assets 

during 2015 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 730 million during 2014 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 834 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 34 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas and revenues from sales of eogowned sand purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eogowned sand sold to third parties 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined 53 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales 

2014 compared to 2013   wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased 1441 million or 17 to 9742 million from 8301 million in 2013 due to an increase of 685 mbbld or 31 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 2558 million partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1117 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10 to 9258 per barrel compared to 10320 per barrel in 2013 

ngl revenues in 2014 increased 160 million or 21 to 934 million from 774 million in 2013 due to an increase of 15 mbbld or 23 in ngl deliveries 179 million partially offset by a lower composite average price 19 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford and the permian basin eogs composite ngl price in 2014 decreased 2 to 3191 per barrel compared to 3255 per barrel in 2013 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased 235 million or 14 to 1916 million from 1681 million in 2013 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13 to 388 per mcf in 2014 compared to 342 per mcf in 2013 natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1 to 1353 mmcfd as compared to 1347 mmcfd in 2013 increased production in the united states 12 mmcfd and trinidad 8 mmcfd was offset by lower production in canada 15 mmcfd in the united states increased production of associated natural gas in the eagle ford and permian basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the upper gulf coast and fort worth basin barnett shale areas 

during 2014 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 834 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 34 million during 2013 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 116 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined 75 million compared to 2013 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities 

operating and other expenses 

2015 compared to 2014  during 2015 operating expenses of 15444 million were 2650 million higher than the 12794 million incurred during 2014    operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million primarily due to commodity price declines the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1182 million in 2015 decreased 234 million from 1416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states 125 million lower lease and well expenses in other international 99 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the united states 21 million partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 12 million 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees costs associated with crudebyrail operations the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 849 million in 2015 decreased 123 million from 972 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 81 million and the eagle ford 48 million primarily due to an increase in the use of pipelines to transport crude oil production partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the permian basin 19 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2015 decreased 683 million to 3314 million from 3997 million in 2014 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were 691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states 513 million and trinidad 28 million a decrease in production in the united states 44 million and lower dda expense in other international 104 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 367 million in 2015 were 35 million lower than 2014 primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses 

net interest expense of 237 million in 2015 was 36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in march 2015 28 million as well as a decrease in capitalized interest 15 million this was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in june 2015 and during 2014 11 million 

exploration costs of 149 million in 2015 decreased 35 million from 184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 19 million and lower exploration administrative expenses in other international 10 million primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 

impairments of 6614 million in 2015 increased 5870 million from 744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 5959 million primarily due to commodity price declines and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 112 million which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eogs estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom 156 million and argentina 43 million proved property and other asset impairments in the united states were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays eog recorded impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 6326 million and 575 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2015 decreased 336 million to 422 million 66 of wellhead revenues from 758 million 60 of wellhead revenues in 2014 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severanceproduction taxes 307 million primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valoremproperty taxes 17 million both in the united states 

other income net was 2 million in 2015 compared to other expense net of 45 million in 2014 the increase of 47 million was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction losses and decreased deferred compensation expense 

eog recognized an income tax benefit of 2397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of 2080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the united states in 2015 the net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35 from 42 in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014 

2014 compared to 2013  during 2014 operating expenses of 12794 million were 1982 million higher than the 10812 million incurred during 2013    the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1416 million in 2014 increased 310 million from 1106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs 209 million increased workover expenditures 69 million and increased lease and well administrative expenses 32 million all in the united states 

transportation costs of 972 million in 2014 increased 119 million from 853 million in 2013 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford 99 million and the rocky mountain area 15 million 

dda expenses in 2014 increased 396 million to 3997 million from 3601 million in 2013 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were 384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the united states 630 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 191 million and canada 37 million and a decrease in production in canada 31 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 402 million in 2014 were 54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations 

net interest expense of 201 million in 2014 was 34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6125 senior notes due 2013 the subsidiary debt and the floating rate notes 31 million as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company 8 million this was partially offset by interest expense on the notes issued in march 2014 10 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 38 million to 146 million in 2014 compared to 108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the eagle ford 

exploration costs of 184 million in 2014 increased 23 million from 161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 

impairments of 744 million in 2014 increased 457 million from 287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom 351 million the united states 145 million and argentina 39 million and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 54 million partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in canada 67 million and trinidad 14 million and lower impairments of other assets in the united states 46 million eog recorded impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 575 million and 172 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of 503 million and 7 million respectively related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value 

taxes other than income in 2014 increased 134 million to 758 million 60 of wellhead revenues from 624 million 58 of wellhead revenues in 2013 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 112 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valoremproperty taxes 34 million in the united states partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2014 for texas highcost gas severance tax rate reductions 11 million 

other expense net was 45 million in 2014 compared to 3 million in 2013 the increase of 42 million was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses 

income tax provision of 2080 million in 2014 increased 840 million from 1240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42 from 36 in the prior year the net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due primarily to valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to eogs undistributed foreign earnings eog no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of 250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash flow 

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2015 were funds generated from operations net proceeds from issuances of longterm debt proceeds from asset sales excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures other property plant and equipment expenditures repayments of debt dividend payments to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans 

2015 compared to 2014   net cash provided by operating activities of 3595 million in 2015 decreased 5054 million from 8649 million in 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues 6188 million unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 591 million and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense 25 million partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses 741 million a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 696 million and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes 302 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 5320 million in 2015 decreased by 2194 million from 7514 million in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties 2795 million and a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 439 million partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities 603 million a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets 377 million and the release of restricted cash in 2014 60 million 

net cash provided by financing activities of 371 million in 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes 990 million net commercial paper borrowings 260 million excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 26 million and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity 23 million cash used in financing activities in 2015 included repayments of longterm debt 500 million cash dividend payments 367 million and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans 49 million 

2014 compared to 2013   net cash provided by operating activities of 8649 million in 2014 increased 1320 million from 7329 million in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues 1837 million favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 391 million and a decrease in net cash paid for interest expense 38 million partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses 662 million an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 82 million and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 48 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 7514 million in 2014 increased by 1199 million from 6315 million in 2013 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties 823 million an increase in additions to other property plant and equipment 364 million and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets 191 million partially offset by the release of restricted cash 126 million and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities 52 million

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions 





 

exploration and development expenditures of 4875 million for 2015 were 2834 million lower than the prior year primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states 2189 million and other international 74 million decreased facilities expenditures 553 million decreased leasehold acquisitions 232 million decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures 19 million and decreased capitalized interest 11 million all in the united states these decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisitions 342 million in the united states the 2015 exploration and development expenditures of 4875 million included 4007 million in development drilling and facilities 481 million in property acquisitions 345 million in exploration and 42 million in capitalized interest the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of 7709 million included 6804 million in development drilling and facilities 709 million in exploration 139 million in property acquisitions and 57 million in capitalized interest the 2013 exploration and development expenditures of 6863 million included 5952 million in development drilling and facilities 742 million in exploration 120 million in property acquisitions and 49 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 34 at december 31 2015 compared to 25 at december 31 2014 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively eog had outstanding 6390 million and 5890 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of 6524 million and 6242 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs senior notes such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2015 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the issuance of the notes cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program and proceeds from asset sales while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2015 was 641 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was 260 million there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2015 the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were 81 million and zero respectively during the year 2015 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 2015 agreement described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2015  in thousands 





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2015 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including trinidad the united kingdom china canada and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2015 was the british pound eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2016 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of february 12 2016 the average 2016 us new york mercantile exchange nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were 3497 per barrel and 223 per mmbtu respectively representing declines of 28 and 17 respectively from the average nymex prices in 2015 see item 1a risk factors 

based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2016 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 65 million for net income and 81 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2016 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2016 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 15 million for net income and 18 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 25 2016 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford delaware basin and bakken plays where it generates its highest ratesofreturn to further enhance the economics of these plays eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs 

  

the total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of approximately 24 billion to 26 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development   and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows net proceeds from the new notes and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 2015 agreement and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2016 both total production and total crude oil production are expected to decline slightly from 2015 levels in 2016 eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and lower service costs 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

depreciation depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the five years ended december 31 2015 west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 3455 per barrel to 11339 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 163 per mmbtu to 815 per mmbtu eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if actual crude oil andor natural gas prices andor actual production diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

exploration and production 

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states with a current focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays 

at december 31 2014 on a crude oil equivalent basis 47 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states were crude oil and condensate 19 were ngl and 34 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2014 and certain 2015 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states    the eagle ford continues to prove itself as a worldclass oil field by yearend 2014 the field had produced in excess of one billion barrels of crude oil and condensate reaching this milestone more quickly than the bakken with approximately 561000 of the 624000 total net acres that eog controls in the prolific oil window eog completed 534 net wells in 2014 eog continues to be the biggest oil producer in the eagle ford play with cumulative gross production in excess of 200 million barrels of crude oil yearend net production approximated 203 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate an increase of 43 over yearend 2013 the combination of selfsourced sand dedicated frac crews and other services along with continual well optimization programs have made this play the centerpiece of eogs portfolio in 2015 eog expects to complete approximately 345 net wells continue to improve well productivity and reduce drilling and completion costs 

the rocky mountain area continues to provide strong liquids growth in 2014 eog continued infill drilling on its crude oil acreage in the williston basin bakken core completing 59 net wells eog tested downspacing to 700foot interwell distances with encouraging results and is in the process of evaluating further downspacing in 2014 eog ramped up its development program in the dj basin completing 21 net wells in the codell and niobrara formations eog continued its development program in the powder river basin completing 30 net wells with production from the parkman and turner formations net average production for the entire rocky mountain area for 2014 was approximately 72 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl an increase of 18 over the prior year in 2015 eog plans to complete approximately 35 net wells primarily in the williston basin bakken and to a lesser extent in the powder river basin 

in 2014 eog completed 62 net wells in the permian basin to develop its liquidsrich leonard wolfcamp and second bone spring sand plays eog is well positioned with approximately 80000 net acres in the leonard shale 140000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale and 90000 net acres in the second bone spring sand all within the delaware basin additionally eog has approximately 113000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale within the midland basin net production in the permian basin for 2014 averaged 33 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl an increase of 43 over 2013 net natural gas production increased 57 to 85 million cubic feet per day mmcfd eog holds approximately 420000 net acres throughout the permian basin in 2015 eog plans to continue the expansion and development primarily in the delaware basin second bone spring sand wolfcamp and leonard plays by completing approximately 95 net wells 

in the upper gulf coast region eog completed 27 net wells during 2014 and net production averaged 82 mmcfd of natural gas and 5 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl in 2015 eog will continue to defer dry gas drilling in the haynesville work to maintain base production and continue its liquids exploration program eog holds approximately 874000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region 

in the midcontinent area eog continued to expand its activities in the anadarko basin during 2014 eog averaged net production of 8 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl and 30 mmcfd of natural gas eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the pennsylvanian sandstones in the anadarko basin completing 18 net wells in 2014 eog holds approximately 250000 net acres throughout the trend and plans to complete approximately 10 net crude oil wells in 2015 

during 2014 eog continued development of its liquidsrich barnett shale combo play in the fort worth basin eog completed 90 net barnett combo wells and continued to upgrade the quality of its acreage position and add potential drilling locations in the barnett combo core area in 2014 net total production in the barnett shale averaged approximately 35 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl and approximately 289 mmcfd of natural gas for 2015 eog will focus on maintaining base production eog currently holds approximately 380000 net acres in the barnett 

in the south texas area eog completed 22 net wells in 2014 net production during 2014 averaged 6 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl and 83 mmcfd of natural gas eog’s activity was focused in san patricio kleberg and brooks counties in 2015 eog’s activity will target the frio and vicksburg trends in south texas eog has approximately 306000 net acres and plans to reduce its activity completing approximately 10 net wells in 2015 

during 2014 eog focused on maintaining base production in the marcellus shale net production for 2014 averaged 30 mmcfd of natural gas in 2015 the focus in the marcellus shale will be on infrastructure projects that will support additional development in the coming years eog currently holds approximately 208000 net acres with marcellus shale potential most of which are held as fee or by production 

eog has agreements with certain crude oil refining companies to deliver an average of 565 mbbld 594 mbbld and 100 mbbld of crude oil in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively to certain refineries eog intends to fulfill these crude oil delivery obligations with its eagle ford production 

at december 31 2014 eog held approximately 24 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2014 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the eagle ford in south texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the barnett shale in north texas at december 31 2014 eogowned natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford and barnett shale was 225 mmcfd and 180 mmcfd respectively 

in support of its operations in the williston basin eog continued to utilize its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota to transport its crude oil production and from time to time crude oil purchased from thirdparty producers eog loaded 350 unit trains each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 70000 barrels of crude oil with crude oil for transport to st james louisiana and stroud oklahoma 

a total of 260 crude oil unit trains carrying eog production were received at a crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana during 2014 owned by eog and nustar energy lp this facility provides access to one of the key markets in the us where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index the st james facility accommodates multiple trains at a single time and has a capacity of approximately 120 mbbld eogs share of that capacity is 100 mbbld 

during 2014 eog utilized its stroud oklahoma crude oil unloading facility and pipeline to transport 72   unit trainloads of crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub these facilities have the capacity to unload approximately 90 mbbld of crude oil 

eog believes that its crudebyrail facilities and logistics provide a competitive advantage giving eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets 

since 2008 eog has been operating its own sand mine and sand processing plant located in hood county texas to reduce costs and to help fulfill eogs sand needs for its well completion operations in the barnett shale combo play eog purchased a second hood county sand processing plant in 2011 and utilizes that facility to process raw eogowned sand from wisconsin as needed to support eogs well completion activities in several key eog plays 

in 2014 eog increased the use of processed sand from its chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant which processes sand from multiple eogowned mines nearby 

during 2014 eog shipped 162 sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each from various sources to eogs sand storage and distribution facility in refugio texas primarily for use in its eagle ford well completions also during 2014 eog shipped the equivalent of 110 unit trains of processed sand for well completions in other plays 

canada  during 2014 eog sold all of its assets in manitoba and the majority of its assets in alberta in two separate transactions that closed on or about december 1 2014 eog divested 13 million gross acres 11 million net 97 percent of which were in alberta of the approximate 5800 producing wells sold 5155 were natural gas 

at december 31 2014 eog held approximately 183500 net undeveloped acres in canada 

operations outside the united states and canada 

eog has operations offshore trinidad in the uk north sea and east irish sea and in the china sichuan basin and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas 

trinidad  eog through several of its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited 

 

several fields in the secc block modified ua block modified ub block block 4a and the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold under various contracts with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago and its subsidiary ngc crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited in 2014 eogs average net production from trinidad was 363 mmcfd of natural gas and 10 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

in the fourth quarter of 2014  eog initiated a threenet well drilling program in the secc and modified ub blocks completing one well in 2014 in 2015 eog expects to drill and complete the remaining two net wells in this program 

in 2015 it is anticipated that eogs trinidad operations will supply approximately 480 mmcfd 350 mmcfd net of natural gas from its existing proved reserves all of the natural gas produced from eogs trinidad operations in 2015 is expected to be supplied to ngc pursuant to the requirements of the ngc contracts 

at december 31 2014  eog held approximately 39000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom  eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk owns a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916a located in the southern gas basin of the north sea during 2014  a limited amount of production continued from the valkyrie field in this block 

in 2007 eoguk was awarded a license for two blocks in the east irish sea – blocks 1107b and 11012a in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in the east irish sea block 11012a well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field during 2012 and 2013 the conwy production platform and pipelines were installed modifications to the nearby thirdparty owned douglas platform which will be used to process conwy production began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 first production from the conwy field is anticipated in the third quarter of 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2014 eog recognized a 351 million impairment of the conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines 

in 2014  production averaged less than 01 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom 

at december 31 2014  eog held approximately 35000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

china  in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage in 2014 eog drilled two wells and completed two wells one of which was originally drilled in 2013 in 2015 eog expects to complete the second well that was drilled in 2014 and drill and complete four additional wells 

in 2014  production averaged 85 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

at december 31 2014  eog held no net undeveloped acres in china 

argentina  in 2011 eog signed two exploration contracts and one farmin agreement covering approximately 95000 net acres in the neuquén basin in neuquén province argentina in 2014 eog completed a vertical well in the cerro avispa block that was drilled in late 2013 and determined the well to be a dry hole also during 2014 eog participated in the drilling of two wells in the bajo del toro block both of which were determined to be dry holes in the fourth quarter of 2014 eog recognized an impairment charge of 44 million for the balance of its investment in argentina management is currently evaluating options for its investment 

other international  eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

in 2014  eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline truck or eogs crudebyrail assets to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major sales points included cushing oklahoma st james louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2015  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2014  eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngl ngl were sold at prevailing market prices in 2015  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2014  eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing based on the spot market and longterm natural gas contracts was at prevailing market prices in 2015  the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

  

in 2014  a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2015  

in 2014  all wellhead natural gas volumes from the uk were sold on the spot market the 2015  marketing strategy for wellhead natural gas volumes from the uk is expected to remain the same in december 2014 eog put in place arrangements to market and sell its uk wellhead crude oil production which is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2015 

in 2014  all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold at regulated prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for production in china is expected to remain the same in 2015  

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2014  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues both purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngl to 60 mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 







 

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production   crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and 

the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases which for eog are de minimis by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations in addition the us department of the interior via various of its agencies including the blm the bia and the office of natural resources revenues has certain authority over our payment of royalties bonuses fines penalties assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases 

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngl by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

eog also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in north dakota and texas crude oil rail unloading facilities in oklahoma and louisiana and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its us plays regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail operations and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal state and local regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions agencies councils and courts will remain unchanged 

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  united states  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions recent us epa rulemaking may result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the federal clean air act eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice 

eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog is now reporting ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in october 2009 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that otherwise would not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations 

currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements however there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions in april 2012 the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local 

permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations including environmental regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within those countries eog currently has operations in canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors   

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

a substantial or extended decline in crude oil andor natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngl and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

lower crude oil andor natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil andor natural gas that we can produce economically substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves as a result a prolonged or substantial decline in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations liquidity and ability to finance capital expenditures and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

in addition if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of 

 14 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves our future cash flows and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws 

regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

in addition there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the us at the federal level currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the us is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states and hydraulic fracturing  united states under item 1 business  regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 

legislation may be proposed that would if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws including the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such changes may include but not be limited to the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs it is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be proposed and if enacted how soon any such changes would become effective the enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and thirdparty working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties 

may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of noncore assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however reduce our cash flows further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally while weakened in recent years have improved somewhat however there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence 

we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swaps options swaptions and collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc has issued numerous rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a proposed rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps margin rule and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule 

we qualify as a “nonfinancial entity” for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing we also qualify as a “nonfinancial entity” for purposes of the margin rule therefore if such rule is adopted our uncleared swaps will not be subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted however many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the enduser exception may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties andor may be subject to the position limits rule 

the doddfrank act and the rules adopted thereunder could increase the cost of derivative contracts alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act and related regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 approximately 4 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats 

as a producer of crude oil and natural gas we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations 

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information  for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngl and natural gas as well as discussion of eogs proved undeveloped reserves the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or 

downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

net income for 2014 totaled 2915 million as compared to 2197 million for 2013 at december 31 2014 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2497 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 378 mmboe from december 31 2013 during 2014 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngl reserves increased by 329 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 298 billion cubic feet or 50 mmboe 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2014 

united states and canada   eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs in 2014 eog remained focused on developing its existing north american crude oil and liquidsrich acreage in addition increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oilinplace remained areas of emphasis in 2014 eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects on a volumetric basis as calculated using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngl to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 69 of total north american production during 2014 compared to 63 in 2013 this liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the south texas eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin in 2014 eogs net eagle ford production averaged 2027 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngl as compared to 1409 mbbld in 2013 eogs major producing areas are in new mexico north dakota texas utah and wyoming 

eog continues to deliver its crude oil to various markets in the united states including sales points on the gulf coast where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet crude oil index eogs crudebyrail facilities provide eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets including the gulf coast cushing oklahoma and other markets 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 eog completed the divestiture of all its assets in manitoba canada and the majority of its assets in alberta canada in two separate transactions proceeds from the divestitures were approximately 400 million united states dollars net of customary transaction adjustments as a result of these transactions approximately 150 million united states dollars of restricted cash related to future abandonment liabilities was released the proceeds and cash were utilized for general corporate purposes production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7050 barrels of crude oil per day 580 barrels of ngl per day and 435 million cubic feet of natural gas per day net proved reserves divested are estimated to be 77 million barrels of oil 08 million barrels of ngl and 787 billion cubic feet of natural gas eog divested 13 million gross acres 11 million net acres 97 percent of which were in alberta and approximately 5800 producing wells of which 5155 were natural gas eog reclassified approximately 383 million of accumulated translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income as the divestitures represented a substantially complete liquidation of eogs canadian operations see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

international  in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a and modified ub block and the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited in the fourth quarter of 

2014 eog initiated a threenet well drilling program in the secc and modified ub blocks completing one well in 2014 in 2015 eog expects to drill and complete the remaining two net wells in this program 

in the united kingdom eog continues to make progress in the development of its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil discovery modifications to the nearby thirdparty owned douglas platform which will be used to process conwy production began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 first production from the conwy field is anticipated in the third quarter of 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2014 eog recognized a 351 million impairment of the conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines 

in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in 2014 eog drilled two wells and completed two wells one of which was originally drilled in 2013 in 2015 eog expects to complete the second well that was drilled in 2014 and drill and complete four additional wells 

eogs activity in argentina is focused on the vaca muerta oil shale formation in the neuquén basin in neuquén province in 2014 eog completed a vertical well in the cerro avispa block that was drilled in late 2013 and determined the well to be a dry hole also during 2014 eog participated in the drilling of two wells in the bajo del toro block both of which were determined to be dry holes in the fourth quarter of 2014 eog recognized an impairment charge of 44 million for the balance of its investment in argentina management is currently evaluating options for its investment 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 25 at december 31 2014 and 28 at december 31 2013 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity at december 31 2014 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 295 senior notes due 2015 were reclassified as longterm debt based upon eogs intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other longterm debt 

on march 21 2014 eog closed its sale of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 245 senior notes due 2020 notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning october 1 2014 net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately 496 million were used for general corporate purposes 

on march 17 2014 eog repaid upon maturity the 150 million aggregate principal amount of its 475 subsidiary debt due 2014 subsidiary debt and settled the foreign currency swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the subsidiary debt for 32 million 

on february 3 2014 eog repaid upon maturity the 350 million aggregate principal amount of its floating rate senior notes due 2014 floating rate notes on the same date eog settled the interest rate swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the floating rate notes for 08 million 

during 2014 eog funded 84 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid at maturity 500 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt paid 280 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 127 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds of 569 million from the sale of assets net proceds from the sale of the notes and 99 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation 

total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 49 billion to 51 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2015 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1 

net operating revenues 

during 2014 net operating revenues increased 3548 million or 24 to 18035 million from 14487 million in 2013 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas increased 1837 million or 17 to 12593 million in 2014 from 10756 million in 2013 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngl in 2014 were approximately 85 of total wellhead revenues compared to 84 in 2013 during 2014 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 834 million compared to net losses of 166 million in 2013 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 402 million during 2014 to 4046 million from 3644 million in 2013 gains on asset dispositions net totaled 508 million and 198 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows 





 32 

2014 compared to 2013   wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased 1441 million or 17 to 9742 million from 8301 million in 2013 due to an increase of 685 mbbld or 31 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 2558 million partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 1117 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin eogs composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10 to 9258 per barrel compared to 10320 per barrel in 2013 

ngl revenues in 2014 increased 160 million or 21 to 934 million from 774 million in 2013 due to an increase of 15 mbbld or 23 in ngl deliveries 179 million partially offset by a lower composite average price 19 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford and the permian basin eogs composite ngl price in 2014 decreased 2 to 3191 per barrel compared to 3255 per barrel in 2013 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased 235 million or 14 to 1916 million from 1681 million in 2013 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13 to 388 per mcf in 2014 compared to 342 per mcf in 2013 natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1 to 1353 mmcfd as compared to 1347 mmcfd in 2013 increased production in the united states 12 mmcfd and trinidad 8 mmcfd was offset by lower production in canada 15 mmcfd in the united states increased production of associated natural gas in the eagle ford and permian basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the upper gulf coast and fort worth basin barnett shale areas 

during 2014 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 834 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 34 million during 2013 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of 116 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined 75 million compared to 2013 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities 

2013 compared to 2012   wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2013 increased 2642 million or 47 to 8301 million from 5659 million in 2012 due to an increase of 63 mbbld or 40 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 2205 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 437 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2013 increased 6 to 10320 per barrel compared to 9777 per barrel in 2012 

ngl revenues in 2013 increased 47 million or 6 to 774 million from 727 million in 2012 due to an increase of 9 mbbld or 17 in ngl deliveries 118 million partially offset by a lower composite average price 71 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford eogs composite average ngl price in 2013 decreased 8 to 3255 per barrel compared to 3554 per barrel in 2012 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2013 increased 109 million or 7 to 1681 million from 1572 million in 2012 the increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 288 million partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries 179 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 21 to 342 per mcf in 2013 compared to 283 per mcf in 2012 natural gas deliveries in 2013 decreased 169 mmcfd or 11 primarily due to decreased production in the united states 126 mmcfd trinidad 23 mmcfd and canada 19 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2012 

during 2013 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 116 million during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 711 million 

during 2013 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2013 decreased 66 million compared to 2012 due primarily to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities 

operating and other expenses 

2014 compared to 2013  during 2014 operating expenses of 12794 million were 1982 million higher than the 10812 million incurred during 2013    the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time 

lease and well expenses of 1416 million in 2014 increased 310 million from 1106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs 209 million increased workover expenditures 69 million and increased lease and well administrative expenses 32 million all in the united states 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees costs associated with crudebyrail operations the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs 

transportation costs of 972 million in 2014 increased 119 million from 853 million in 2013 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford 99 million and the rocky mountain area 15 million 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and 

impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 

dda expenses in 2014 increased 396 million to 3997 million from 3601 million in 2013 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were 384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the united states 630 million partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states 191 million and canada 37 million and a decrease in production in canada 31 million unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies 

ga expenses of 402 million in 2014 were 54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations 

net interest expense of 201 million in 2014 was 34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6125 senior notes due 2013 the subsidiary debt and the floating rate notes 31 million as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company 8 million this was partially offset by interest expense on the notes issued in march 2014 10 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets 

gathering and processing costs increased 38 million to 146 million in 2014 compared to 108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the eagle ford 

exploration costs of 184 million in 2014 increased 23 million from 161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 

impairments of 744 million in 2014 increased 457 million from 287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom 351 million the united states 145 million and argentina 39 million and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 54 million partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in canada 67 million and trinidad 14 million and lower impairments of other assets in the united states 46 million eog recorded impairments of proved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 575 million and 172 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of 503 million and 7 million respectively related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2014 increased 134 million to 758 million 60 of wellhead revenues from 624 million 58 of wellhead revenues in 2013 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severanceproduction taxes 112 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valoremproperty taxes 34 million in the united states partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2014 for texas highcost gas severance tax rate reductions 11 million 

other expense net was 45 million in 2014 compared to 3 million in 2013 the increase of 42 million was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses 

income tax provision of 2080 million in 2014 increased 840 million from 1240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42 from 36 in the prior year the net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due primarily to valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to eogs undistributed foreign earnings eog no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of 250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 

2013 compared to 2012  during 2013 operating expenses of 10812 million were 609 million higher than the 10203 million incurred during 2012    the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 





 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes 

lease and well expenses of 1106 million in 2013 increased 106 million from 1000 million in 2012 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 48 million and canada 13 million and increased workover expenditures in the united states 38 million 

transportation costs of 853 million in 2013 increased 252 million from 601 million in 2012 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford 136 million the rocky mountain area 84 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 27 million 

dda expenses in 2013 increased 431 million to 3601 million from 3170 million in 2012 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2013 were 473 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to increased production in the united states 347 million and higher unit rates in the united states 133 million and trinidad 44 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 29 million and trinidad 10 million and lower unit rates in canada 12 million dda unit rates in the united states increased due primarily to downward revisions of natural gas reserves at december 31 2012 and a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties 

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 42 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 32 million the eagle ford 7 million and the rocky mountain area 7 million 

ga expenses of 348 million in 2013 were 17 million higher than 2012 due primarily to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations 

net interest expense of 235 million in 2013 was 22 million higher than 2012 due primarily to interest expense on the 1250 million principal amount of 2625 senior notes due 2023 issued in september 2012 23 million this was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 6125 senior notes which were repaid at maturity in october 2013 6 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 10 million to 108 million in 2013 compared to 98 million in 2012 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford 22 million partially offset by decreased costs in canada 9 million 

exploration costs of 161 million in 2013 decreased 25 million from 186 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 

impairments of 287 million in 2013 decreased 984 million from 1271 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada 881 million decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 98 million and decreased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 17 million eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 172 million and 1133 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2013 and 2012 amounts include impairments of 7 million and 1022 million respectively related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value 

taxes other than income in 2013 increased 129 million to 624 million 58 of wellhead revenues from 495 million 62 of wellhead revenues in 2012 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 122 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 15 million partially offset by decreased severanceproduction taxes in canada 9 million 

other expense net was 3 million in 2013 compared to other income net of 14 million in 2012 the decrease of 17 million was primarily due to losses on warehouse stock sales and adjustments 

income tax provision of 1240 million in 2013 increased 530 million from 710 million in 2012 primarily due to higher pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2013 decreased to 36 from 55 in 2012 due primarily to the absence of certain 2012 canadian losses 26 statutory tax rate

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 in millions 





 

exploration and development expenditures of 7709 million for 2014 were 846 million higher than the prior year primarily due to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 1019 million and china 12 million and increased property acquisitions 19 million increased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures 18 million and increased capitalized interest 8 million all in the united states these increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in canada 82 million trinidad 57 million the united kingdom 40 million and argentina 14 million and decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 46 million the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of 7709 million included 6804 million in development 709 million in exploration 139 million in property acquisitions and 57 million in capitalized interest the 2013 exploration and development expenditures of 6863 million included 5952 million in development 742 million in exploration 120 million in property acquisitions and 49 million in capitalized interest the 2012 exploration and development expenditures of 6941 million included 5989 million in development 901 million in exploration and 50 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 25 at december 31 2014 compared to 28 at december 31 2013 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

the principal amount of debt outstanding totaled 5890 million at both december 31 2014 and 2013 the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 6242 million and 6222 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding 

interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs debt such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 

during 2014 eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2014 was 345 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2014 was 31 million with zero outstanding at yearend the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were 12 million and 01 million respectively during the year 2014 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2014 in thousands 





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2014 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2014 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2014 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses as previously discussed during the fourth quarter of 2014 eog sold substantially all of its canadian assets eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 

eog was party to a foreign currency aggregate swap with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may have resulted from the subsidiary debt the foreign currency swap expired and was settled contemporaneously with the repayment upon maturity of the subsidiary debt on march 17 2014 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment worldwide supplies of crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngl natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas in 2015 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position as of january 30 2015 the average 2015 us new york mercantile exchange nymex crude oil and natural gas price was 5186 and 285 respectively representing declines of 44 and 35 respectively from the average nymex prices in 2014 see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2015 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2015 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngl price is approximately 63 million for net income and 93 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2015 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2015 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 15 million for net income and 22 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 16 2015 see derivative transactions above 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford delaware basin and bakken plays 

  

the total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures of 49 to 51 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain eogs strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration development   and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its credit agreement and equity and debt offerings 

  

operations in 2015 eog does not plan to increase crude oil production in the current low commodity price environment overall production in 2015 is expected to decline modestly from 2014 levels and total crude oil production is expected to be flat as compared to the prior year in 2015 eog expects to allocate capital primarily to its highest rateofreturn crude oil assets focus on cost reductions and seek out opportunities to acquire highquality acreage at low costs 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngl and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

oil and gas exploration costs 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2012 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to a project in the united kingdom that had been deferred for more than one year see note 16 to consolidated financial statements these costs met the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the past five years west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 5345 per barrel to 11339 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 182 per mmbtu to 815 per mmbtu eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if actual crude oil andor natural gas prices andor actual production diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

united states and canada operations

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states and canada with a current focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays

at december 31 2013 on a crude oil equivalent basis 44 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states and canada were crude oil and condensate 19 were ngls and 37 were natural gas the majority of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2013 and certain 2014 plans for eogs united states and canada operations

united states the eagle ford continues to prove itself as among the best resource plays in the world with approximately 564000 of the 632000 total net acres that eog controls within the prolific oil window eog completed 466 net wells in 2013 yielding a direct aftertax rate of return 1 in excess of 100 in 2013 eog continued to decrease well costs and believes it has the lowest completed well costs in the play while continuing to have the most productive wells the combination of selfsourced sand dedicated frac crews and other services along with continual well optimization programs have made this play the centerpiece of eogs portfolio

eog is the biggest oil producer in the eagle ford play with yearend net volumes of approximately 142 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate an increase of 79 over yearend 2012 in addition to being an anchor shipper on the enterprise products partners lp eagle ford crude oil pipeline eog began shipping its crude oil on the kinder morgan crude oil and condensate pipeline into the houston market in december 2013 eogs capacity on the kinder morgan crude oil and condensate pipeline provides further diversification and the security of firm transportation capacity for its eagle ford production eogs large contiguous acreage position allows for low transportation and operating costs which adds to the overall return for the play in 2014 eog plans to drill approximately 520 net wells and build infrastructure to accommodate production from its western eagle ford acreage

the rocky mountain area continues to provide strong liquids growth in 2013 eog began infill drilling on its crude oil acreage in the williston basin bakken core drilling 39 net wells eog continued its development program in the powder river basin drilling 20 net wells in the turner sand formation net average production for the entire rocky mountain area for 2013 was approximately 61 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls an increase of 17 over the prior year natural gas production decreased 6 compared to 2012 with activity focused on liquids growth eog plans to increase activity in the rocky mountain area in 2014

in 2013 eog drilled and participated in 61 net wells in the permian basin to develop its liquidsrich leonard and wolfcamp plays eog is well positioned with approximately 73000 net acres in the leonard shale and 134000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale all within the delaware basin additionally eog has approximately 113000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale within the midland basin net production in the permian basin for 2013 averaged 23 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls an increase of 40 over 2012 natural gas production increased 24 to 54 million cubic feet per day mmcfd after divestitures in 2013 eog holds approximately 413000 net acres throughout the permian basin in 2014 eog plans to continue the expansion and development of the leonard and wolfcamp plays by drilling approximately 65 net wells 

in the upper gulf coast region eog drilled 21 net wells and net production averaged 124 mmcfd of natural gas and 19 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2013 the haynesville and bossier shale plays located near the texaslouisiana border continue to be core natural gas assets eog controls approximately 143000 net acres all within the highly productive areas of these plays due to low natural gas prices eog plans to defer dry gas drilling until natural gas economics improve sufficiently to support the activity however in 2013 eog successfully tested and confirmed high ngls and condensate production in the panola county region of eogs haynesville leasehold total net liquids volumes increased to 4 mbbld at yearend 2013 eog holds approximately 593000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region and plans to increase activity during 2014

in the midcontinent area eog continued to expand its activities in the western anadarko basin during 2013 eog averaged net production of 80 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and 33 mmcfd of natural gas crude oil volumes increased 6 in 2013 compared to 2012 in 2013 eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the pennsylvanian sandstones in the anadarko basin drilling 36 net wells eog holds approximately 200000 net acres throughout the trend and plans to drill approximately 25 net crude oil wells in 2014

during 2013 eog continued development of its liquidsrich barnett shale combo play in the fort worth basin eog drilled 142 net barnett combo wells and continued to upgrade the quality of its acreage position and add potential drilling locations in the barnett combo core area in 2013 net daily total production in the barnett shale averaged approximately 36 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and approximately 305 mmcfd of natural gas for 2014 eog will continue to be active in this play with plans to drill approximately 105 net barnett shale combo wells

in the south texas area eog drilled 30 net wells in 2013 net production during 2013 averaged 6 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and 86 mmcfd of natural gas eogs activity was focused in san patricio nueces brooks kenedy and kleberg counties in 2014 eog will continue to exploit the liquidsrich frio and vicksburg sands on its approximately 320000 net acre position in these counties and plans to drill approximately 24 net wells

during 2013 eog significantly slowed development of the marcellus shale drilling a total of four net wells and completing one net well to hold its acreage position net production for 2013 averaged 36 mmcfd of natural gas for 2014 marcellus shale development plans are minimal focusing on infrastructure projects that will support additional marcellus shale development in the coming years eog currently holds approximately 195000 net acres with marcellus shale potential most of which is held as fee or by production

at december 31 2013 eog held approximately 27 million net undeveloped acres in the united states

during 2013 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the eagle ford in south texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the barnett shale in north texas at december 31 2013 eogowned natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford and barnett shale was 225 mmcfd and 180 mmcfd respectively

in support of its operations in the williston basin eog continued to increase the utilization of its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota to transport its crude oil production and from time to time crude oil purchased from thirdparty producers eog loaded 406 unit trains each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 70000 barrels of crude oil with crude oil for transport to st james louisiana stroud oklahoma and certain other destinations in the us

additionally in support of eog operations in the eagle ford the permian basin and the barnett shale eog continued to use its crude oil loading facilities in harwood and barnhart texas and established a new crude oil loading facility near fort worth texas at these facilities crude oil is loaded onto unit trains of approximately 70 cars each with aggregate capacity of approximately 45000 barrels per train and shipped to st james louisiana or to other destinations on the us gulf coast during 2013 a total of 89 unit train shipments were made from these three facilities

a total of 372 crude oil unit trains carrying eog production were received at a crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana during 2013 owned by eog and nustar energy lp this facility provides access to one of the key markets in the us where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index the st james facility accommodates multiple trains at a single time and has a capacity of approximately 120 mbbld eogs share of that capacity is 100 mbbld

during 2013 eog utilized its stroud oklahoma crude oil unloading facility and pipeline to transport 50 unit trainloads of crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub these facilities have the capacity to unload approximately 90 mbbld of crude oil eog also delivered crude by rail to certain other thirdparty operated facilities in the us

eog believes that its crudebyrail facilities and logistics processes provide a competitive advantage giving eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets

since 2008 eog has been operating its own sand mine and sand processing plant located in hood county texas to reduce costs and to help fulfill eogs sand needs for its well completion operations in the barnett shale combo play eog purchased a second hood county sand processing plant in 2011 and utilizes that facility to process raw eogowned sand from wisconsin as needed to support eogs well completion activities in several key eog plays

in 2013 eog increased the use of processed sand from its chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant which processes sand from multiple eogowned mines nearby 

during 2013 eog shipped 141 sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each from various sources to eogs sand storage and distribution facility in refugio texas primarily for use in its eagle ford well completions also during 2013 eog shipped the equivalent of 89 unit trains of processed sand for well completions in other plays

eog also continued utilization of its resin coating plant located at the refugio sand storage facility after coating for added strength and sand control the sand is shipped primarily to the eagle ford eog also ships its coated sand to other plays including the north dakota bakken and the permian basin 

canada eog conducts operations in canada through its whollyowned subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from its offices in calgary alberta during 2013 eogrc continued its focus on horizontal crude oil exploitation mainly through its development of the shallow spearfish formation in southwest manitoba of the 93 net wells eogrc drilled or participated in during 2013 91 were horizontal and 2 were vertical in 2014 eogrc will continue to develop its manitoba acreage as well as drill test wells on existing acreage in alberta to identify new targets in 2013 net crude oil and condensate and ngls production was 79 mbbld and net natural gas production was 76 mmcfd

at december 31 2013 eogrc held approximately 483000 net undeveloped acres in canada

in december 2012 eogrc signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the planned kitimat lng terminal and the proposed pacific trail pipelines as well as approximately 28500 undeveloped net acres in the horn river basin to chevron canada limited the transaction closed in february 2013



1 direct aftertax rate of return   the calculation of our direct aftertax rate of return with respect to our capital expenditures for our net wells drilled in the eagle ford in 2013 is based on the estimated proved reserves net to our interest associated with such wells the estimated present value of the future net cash flows from such reserves for which we utilize certain assumptions regarding future commodity prices and operating costs and our direct net costs incurred in drilling such wells as such our aftertax rate of return with respect to our capital expenditures for our net wells drilled in the eagle ford in 2013 cannot be calculated from our audited financial statements for fiscal year 2013

other international eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified

marketing

in 2013 eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline truck or eogs crudebyrail assets to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major sales points included cushing oklahoma st james louisiana and other points along the us gulf coast in 2014 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2013 eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned facilities or at thirdparty facilities extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2014 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2013 eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing based on the spot market and longterm natural gas contracts was at prevailing market prices in 2014 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

 

in 2013 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2014

in 2013 all wellhead natural gas volumes from the uk were sold on the spot market the 2014 marketing strategy for wellhead natural gas volumes from the uk is expected to remain the same eog is currently investigating possible marketing opportunities for its uk wellhead crude oil production which is anticipated to begin in late 2014

in 2013 all wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2014

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities

during 2013 two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues both purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

competition

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources

regulation

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production   crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments for federal and state leases production taxes and ad valorem taxes

a portion of eogs oil and gas leases in new mexico north dakota utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the bureau of indian affairs bia or in the case of offshore leases by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and in the case of leases relating to tribal lands certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations

blm bia and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm bia boem or bsee as applicable may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

eog also owns crude oil loading facilities in north dakota and texas and crude oil unloading facilities in oklahoma and louisiana regulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety environmental permitting and packaginglabeling requirements additional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any any such new regulations might have on its crudebyrail operations eog could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory agencies and courts will continue indefinitely

canadian regulation of crude oil and natural gas production  the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and gas industry with respect to taxes and factors affecting prices transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities or increase eogs costs and therefore may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties royalties payable on lands that the government has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing eogs revenues earnings and cash flow

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

climate change  united states  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions recent us epa rulemaking may result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the federal clean air act eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice

eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog is now reporting ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in october 2009 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that would otherwise not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations

currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements however there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in april 2012 the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

environmental regulation  canada   all phases of the oil and gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances into the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

as discussed above local provincial national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to work with the united states to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors in addition regulation of ghg emissions in canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level for example the governments of alberta and british columbia each regulate ghg emissions and the government of manitoba is currently considering the creation of a capandtrade system to reduce ghg emissions in manitoba canada was an original signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the kyoto protocol but canada withdrew from the kyoto protocol effective december 2012

in canada the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the provincial and local levels through permitting and other compliance requirements some provinces and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such provincial and local requirements restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in canada but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary

other regulation   eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report

other matters

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2013 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2014 average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states and canada increased 6 in 2013 5 in 2012 and 24 in 2011 each as compared to the immediately preceding year average ngls prices received by eog for production in the united states and canada decreased 8 in 2013 and 30 in 2012 and increased 21 in 2011 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 31 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states and canada in 2013 a 36 decrease in 2012 and an 8 decrease in 2011 each as compared to the immediately preceding year due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in prices of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors

including the impact of eogs 2014 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2014 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngls price is approximately 44 million for net income and 65 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2014 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2014 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 13 million for net income and 19 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2014 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2013 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 11 to consolidated financial statements in addition to financial transactions from time to time eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2014 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2013 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas including rig and well explosions cratering fires loss of well control and leaks and spills each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident with respect to eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

texas severance tax rate reduction  natural gas production from qualifying texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production however the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a wellbywell basis

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries

a substantial or extended decline in crude oil andor natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations

in addition if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing compressing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses liabilities and other additional costs as a result of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore operations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions regulatory reasons mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer shale plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery

any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which could in turn impact our future cash flows and results of operations

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future

our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal state tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental health safety or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental health safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state tribal local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

in addition there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the us at the federal level currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the us is primarily conducted at the state level and in canada at the provincial and local levels through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states hydraulic fracturing  united states and environmental regulation  canada under item 1 business  regulation

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions

certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation

 

legislation has been proposed that would if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws including the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies these changes include but are not limited to the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs it is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could become effective the enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions the unavailability of gathering processing compression transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems such as title or environmental issues nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would reduce our cash flows further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shutins and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally while weakened in recent years have improved somewhat however there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and access to the facilities equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists necessary to explore for develop produce market and transport crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services facilities equipment materials and personnel in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated

estimating quantities of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs gathering processing compression and transportation costs severance ad valorem and other applicable production taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result lower prices for natural gas production

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swaps options swaptions and collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts

recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although a number of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc has issued several rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception and a proposed rule imposing position limits position limits rule

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing however it remains uncertain whether margin requirements will be imposed on uncleared swaps the doddfrank act the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and the position limits rule to the extent that it is ultimately enacted could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including costs related to requirements to post collateral materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and related regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditures requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 approximately 3 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar

our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats

as a producer of crude oil and natural gas we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing facilities refineries rail facilities and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations

our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas as well as discussion of eogs proved undeveloped reserves the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

in general the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

acreage the following table summarizes eogs developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2013 excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests

 

most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 07 million net acres will expire in 2014 05 million net acres will expire in 2015 and 03 million net acres will expire in 2016 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy

net income for 2013 totaled 2197 million as compared to 570 million for 2012 at december 31 2013 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2119 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 308 mmboe from december 31 2012 during 2013 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 257 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 305 billion cubic feet or 51 mmboe

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2013

united states and canada   eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs in 2013 eog focused its efforts on developing its existing north american crude oil and liquidsrich acreage and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of the oilinplace in these plays increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and improving the recovery factor of oilinplace are expected to continue to be areas of emphasis in 2014 in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects on a volumetric basis as calculated using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 63 of total north american production during 2013 compared to 53 in 2012 this liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the south texas eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin in 2013 eogs net eagle ford production averaged 1409 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls as compared to 835 mbbld in 2012 based on current trends eog expects its 2014 crude oil and condensate and ngls production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2013 eogs major producing areas are in new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada

eog continues to deliver its crude oil to various markets in the united states including sales points on the gulf coast where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet crude oil index eogs crudebyrail facilities provide eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets including the gulf coast cushing oklahoma and other markets

in december 2012 eog resources canada inc eogrc signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the planned kitimat liquefied natural gas export terminal the proposed pacific trail pipelines and approximately 28500 undeveloped net acres in the horn river basin the transaction closed in february 2013

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block block 4a and modified ub block and the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago and crude oil and condensate sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited during 2013 eog completed its fourwell program in the modified ua block drilling three development wells and one successful exploratory well all four wells began production in 2013 in addition an existing well was successfully recompleted and began production in 2013 eog expects to drill three net wells in the secc and modified ub blocks during 2014

in the united kingdom eog continues to make progress in the development of its 100 working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil discovery in 2013 after drilling an appraisal well eog determined that the adjoining corfe field did not contain proved commercial reserves in 2012 the uk department of energy and climate change approved the field development plans and the conwy production platform and pipelines were installed during 2012 and 2013 in 2013 modifications to the nearby thirdparty owned douglas platform began and a crude oil processing module was installed the douglas platform will be used to process conwy production during 2013 the threewell conwy development drilling program was completed with first production from the conwy field anticipated in late 2014 in 2013 costs totaling 241 million associated with the central north sea columbus natural gas project were written off also in 2013 eog drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well in the central north sea block 2112b in the first quarter of 2014 eog drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well in the east irish sea block 1107b

in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuan zhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage during the first half of 2013 eog successfully recompleted a well and drilled and completed an additional well both of which began production in the latter part of 2013 additionally in 2013 eog drilled one well that is expected to be completed and begin producing in 2014 eog plans to drill six additional wells on its acreage in 2014

in 2011 eog signed two exploration contracts and one farmin agreement covering approximately 95000 net acres in the neuquén basin in neuquén province argentina during 2013 eog completed a well in the aguada del chivato block that w as drilled in 2012 also in late 2013 eog participated in the drilling of a vertical well in the cerro avispa block in 2014 eog plans to complete this vertical well participate in the drilling of a well in the cerro avispa block and a well in the bajo del toro block eog continues to evaluate its drilling results and exploration program in argentina 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 at december 31 2013 and 32 at december 31 2012 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity

on october 1 2013 eog repaid at maturity the 400 million principal amount of its 6125 senior notes due 2013 6125 senior notes at december 31 2013 350 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2014 floating rate notes and 150 million principal amount of 475 subsidiary debt due 2014 were classified as longterm debt based upon eogs ability and intent to ultimately replace such amounts with other longterm debt on february 3 2014 eog repaid upon maturity the floating rate notes and settled the related interest rate swap

during 2013 eog funded 72 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid at maturity the 6125 senior notes paid 199 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 64 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds of 761 million from the sale of certain north american assets 56 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation and proceeds of 39 million from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity

total anticipated 2014 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 81 billion to 83 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2014 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas drilling activity eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and equity and debt offerings

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history

results of operations

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1

net operating revenues

during 2013 net operating revenues increased 2804 million or 24 to 14487 million from 11683 million in 2012 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas increased 2798 million or 35 to 10756 million in 2013 from 7958 million in 2012 revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2013 were approximately 84 of total wellhead revenues compared to 80 in 2012 during 2013 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million compared to net gains of 394 million in 2012 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 547 million or 18 during 2013 to 3644 million from 3097 million in 2012 gains on asset dispositions net totaled 198 million and 193 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows

 

1   thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

 

 

 

2013 compared to 2012   wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2013 increased 2642 million or 47 to 8301 million from 5659 million in 2012 due to an increase of 63 mbbld or 40 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 2205 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 437 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford the north dakota bakken and the permian basin eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2013 increased 6 to 10320 per barrel compared to 9777 per barrel in 2012

ngls revenues in 2013 increased 47 million or 6 to 774 million from 727 million in 2012 due to an increase of 9 mbbld or 17 in ngls deliveries 118 million partially offset by a lower composite average price 71 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford eogs composite average ngls price in 2013 decreased 8 to 3255 per barrel compared to 3554 per barrel in 2012

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2013 increased 109 million or 7 to 1681 million from 1572 million in 2012 the increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 288 million partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries 179 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 21 to 342 per mcf in 2013 compared to 283 per mcf in 2012 natural gas deliveries in 2013 decreased 169 mmcfd or 11 primarily due to decreased production in the united states 126 mmcfd trinidad 23 mmcfd and canada 19 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2012

during 2013 eog recognized net losses on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 166 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 116 million during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 711 million

gathering processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs

during 2013 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2013 decreased 66 million compared to 2012 due primarily to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities

2012 compared to 2011   wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2012 increased 1821 million or 47 to 5659 million from 3838 million in 2011 due to an increase of 45 mbbld or 39 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 1533 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 288 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford and the north dakota bakken eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2012 increased 5 to 9777 per barrel compared to 9279 per barrel in 2011

ngls revenues in 2012 decreased 52 million or 7 to 727 million from 779 million in 2011 due to a lower composite average price 304 million partially offset by an increase of 14 mbbld or 32 in ngls deliveries 252 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford 7 mbbld the fort worth basin barnett shale area 3 mbbld and the permian basin 2 mbbld eogs composite average ngls price in 2012 decreased 30 to 3554 per barrel compared to 5041 per barrel in 2011

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2012 decreased 669 million or 30 to 1572 million from 2241 million in 2011 the decrease was due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 554 million and decreased natural gas deliveries 115 million natural gas deliveries in 2012 decreased 86 mmcfd or 5 to 1516 mmcfd from 1602 mmcfd in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower production in the united states 79 mmcfd and canada 37 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in trinidad 34 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity the decrease in canada primarily reflects decreased production in alberta and the horn river basin area the increase in trinidad was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual deliveries eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 26 to 283 per mcf in 2012 from 383 per mcf in 2011

during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 711 million during 2011 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 626 million which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of 181 million

during 2012 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased compared to 2011 primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2012 totaled 61 million compared to 44 million in 2011

operating and other expenses

2013 compared to 2012  during 2013 operating expenses of 10812 million were 609 million higher than the 10203 million incurred during 2012   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012

  

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time in general operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas

lease and well expenses of 1106 million in 2013 increased 106 million from 1000 million in 2012 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 48 million and canada 13 million and increased workover expenditures in the united states 38 million

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees costs associated with crudebyrail operations the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs

transportation costs of 853 million in 2013 increased 252 million from 601 million in 2012 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford 136 million the rocky mountain area 84 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 27 million

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dda group calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consists of gathering transportation and processing infrastructure assets compressors crudebyrail assets sand mine and sand processing assets vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software

dda expenses in 2013 increased 431 million to 3601 million from 3170 million in 2012 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2013 were 473 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to increased production in the united states 347 million and higher unit rates in the united states 133 million and trinidad 44 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 29 million and trinidad 10 million and lower unit rates in canada 12 million dda unit rates in the united states increased due primarily to downward revisions of natural gas reserves at december 31 2012 and a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 42 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 32 million the eagle ford 7 million and the rocky mountain area 7 million

ga expenses of 348 million in 2013 were 17 million higher than 2012 due primarily to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations

net interest expense of 235 million in 2013 was 22 million higher than 2012 due primarily to interest expense on the 1250 million principal amount of 2625 senior notes due 2023 issued in september 2012 23 million this was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 6125 senior notes which were repaid at maturity in october 2013 6 million

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets

gathering and processing costs increased 10 million to 108 million in 2013 compared to 98 million in 2012 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford 22 million partially offset by decreased costs in canada 9 million

exploration costs of 161 million in 2013 decreased 25 million from 186 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties other property plant and equipment and other assets unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dda group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value

impairments of 287 million in 2013 decreased 984 million from 1271 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada 881 million decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 98 million and decreased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 17 million eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 172 million and 1133 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2013 and 2012 amounts include impairments of 7 million and 1022 million respectively related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets

taxes other than income in 2013 increased 129 million to 624 million 58 of wellhead revenues from 495 million 62 of wellhead revenues in 2012 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 122 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 15 million partially offset by decreased severanceproduction taxes in canada 9 million

other expense net was 3 million in 2013 compared to other income net of 14 million in 2012 the decrease of 17 million was primarily due to losses on warehouse stock sales and adjustments

income tax provision of 1240 million in 2013 increased 530 million from 710 million in 2012 due primarily to higher pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2013 decreased to 36 from 55 in 2012 due primarily to the absence of certain 2012 canadian losses 26 statutory tax rate

2012 compared to 2011  during 2012 operating expenses of 10203 million were 2190 million higher than the 8013 million incurred in 2011   the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011

 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda and ga for 2012 compared to 2011 are set forth below see net operating revenues above for a discussion of production volumes

lease and well expenses of 1000 million in 2012 increased 58 million from 942 million in 2011 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 60 million and trinidad 5 million and increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 15 million partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in canada 12 million and decreased workover expenditures in canada 6 million and the united states 5 million

transportation costs of 601 million in 2012 increased 171 million from 430 million in 2011 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford 101 million and the rocky mountain area 73 million

dda expenses in 2012 increased 654 million to 3170 million from 2516 million in 2011 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2012 were 631 million higher than in 2011 primarily due to higher unit rates 379 million increased production in the united states 296 million and trinidad 7 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 57 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 331 million trinidad 33 million and canada 20 million

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 23 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the eagle ford

ga expenses of 332 million in 2012 were 27 million higher than 2011 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 22 million and higher information systems costs 5 million

gathering and processing costs increased 17 million to 98 million in 2012 compared to 81 million in 2011 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford 21 million partially offset by decreased costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 7 million

exploration costs of 186 million in 2012 increased 14 million from 172 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased expenditures in the united states

impairments of 1271 million in 2012 increased 240 million from 1031 million in 2011 primarily due to increased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada 534 million partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 232 million and decreased amortization of unproved property costs 50 million in the united states eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 1133 million and 834 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2012 and 2011 amounts include impairments of 1022 million and 745 million related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value

taxes other than income in 2012 increased 84 million to 495 million 62 of wellhead revenues from 411 million 60 of wellhead revenues in 2011 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 70 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and a newly enacted fee imposed by the state of pennsylvania on certain wells drilled in the state in 2012 and prior years and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 30 million partially offset by decreased severanceproduction taxes in trinidad 17 million

other income net was 14 million in 2012 compared to 7 million in 2011 the increase of 7 million was primarily due to higher interest income 8 million primarily as a result of interest on severance tax refunds an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 8 million and higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 3 million partially offset by increased losses on warehouse stock 5 million and higher operating losses on eogs investment in the ptp 4 million

income tax provision of 710 million in 2012 decreased 109 million from 819 million in 2011 due primarily to lower pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2012 increased to 55 from 43 in 2011 the effective tax rate for 2012 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due primarily to foreign losses in canada 26 statutory tax rate and canadian valuation allowances

capital resources and liquidity

cash flow

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 were funds generated from operations proceeds from asset sales net proceeds from the sale of common stock net proceeds from issuances of longterm debt excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures other property plant and equipment expenditures dividend payments to stockholders repayments of debt and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans

2013 compared to 2012   net cash provided by operating activities of 7329 million in 2013 increased 2092 million from 5237 million in 2012 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues 2798 million favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 405 million and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes 65 million partially offset by an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 595 million an increase in cash operating expenses 478 million and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense 39 million

net cash used in investing activities of 6315 million in 2013 increased by 196 million from 6119 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets 549 million and an increase in restricted cash 66 million partially offset by a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 256 million favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities 125 million and a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties 38 million

total expenditures

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions

 

 

 

exploration and development expenditures of 6863 million for 2013 were 78 million lower than the prior year due primarily to decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 137 million canada 128 million and argentina 32 million decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 60 million and canada 31 million and decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 27 million these decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisitions in the united states 119 million and increased drilling and facilities expenditures in trinidad 85 million the united kingdom 64 million and china 14 million the 2013 exploration and development expenditures of 6863 million included 5952 million in development 742 million in exploration 120 million in property acquisitions and 49 million in capitalized interest the 2012 exploration and development expenditures of 6941 million included 5989 million in development 901 million in exploration and 50 million in capitalized interest the 2011 exploration and development expenditures of 6466 million included 5797 million in development 607 million in exploration 58 million in capitalized interest and 4 million in property acquisitions

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 at december 31 2013 compared to 32 at december 31 2012 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity

during 2013 the principal amount of total debt outstanding decreased 400 million to 5890 million at december 31 2013 from 6290 million at december 31 2012 the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 6222 million and 7032 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs debt such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow

during 2013 eog funded its capital programs primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2013 was 570 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program was 37 million during the year 2013 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2013 in thousands

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2013 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2013 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2013 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc under those provisions as of december 31 2013 eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of 40 million in current liabilities  other on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in an increase of 2 million to accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook

pricing   crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2014 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position see item 1a risk factors

including the impact of eogs 2014 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2014 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngls price is approximately 44 million for net income and 65 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2014 natural gas derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2014 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 13 million for net income and 19 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2014 see derivative transactions above

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford bakken and three forks and permian basin plays and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas drilling in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities

the total anticipated 2014 capital expenditures of 81 to 83 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain noncore assets eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its credit agreement and equity and debt offerings

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2014 byapprozimately 115 over 2013 levels total liquids production is expected to increase by 24 comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and ngls production of 27 and 12 respectively north american natural gas production is expected to decrease by 6 from 2013 levels

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

oil and gas exploration costs

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2012 and 2011 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that had been deferred for more than one year see note 15 to consolidated financial statements these costs met the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the expected undiscounted future cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the past five years west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 3926 per barrel to 11004 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 203 per mmbtu to 596 per mmbtu eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if actual crude oil andor natural gas prices andor actual production diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances

 

stockbased compensation

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

exploration and production

united states and canada operations

eogs operations are focused in most of the productive basins in the united states and canada with a current focus on crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas plays

at december 31 2012 40 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states and canada on a crude oil equivalent basis were crude oil and condensate 19 were ngls and 41 were natural gas substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of the applicable technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2012 and certain 2013 plans for eogs united states and canada operations

united states the eagle ford shale with welldefined crude oil wet gas and dry gas trends has proven to have the best crude oil economics of any of eogs shale plays eog was one of the first companies to recognize the potential of the eagle ford shale and captured what eog believes to be the best crude oil acreage position within the play with 569000 of its 639000 net acres within the crude oil window eog is the largest oil producer in the play with yearend volumes of 106 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day mboed net of which 75 were crude oil and condensate volumes eogs total eagle ford production for 2012 increased approximately 150 to 944 mboed from 377 mboed in 2011 

eog has a large contiguous acreage block that enhances the economics of the play through the efficient development of crude oil and natural gas gathering systems as well as processing plants to extract ngls eog is also an anchor shipper on the enterprise products partners lp crude oil pipeline which began delivering crude oil from the eagle ford into the texas gulf coast refining complex in july 2012 eog has established a reputation of being a lowcost operator and by utilizing its selfsourced sand along with dedicated frac crews and other services is able to consistently deliver the lowest cost and highest productivity of any operator further enhancing the economics of the play eog drilled 352 net wells in 2012 in this play and in 2013 plans to drill approximately 400 net wells with a 26rig program

during 2012 eog continued development of its liquidsrich barnett shale combo play in the fort worth basin eog drilled 190 net barnett combo wells and continued to upgrade the quality of its acreage position and add potential drilling locations in the liquidsrich combo core area in 2012 the average net daily total production in the barnett shale averaged approximately 388 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and approximately 368 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas for 2013 eog will continue to be active in this play with plans to drill an additional 130 net barnett shale combo wells with a large acreage position of approximately 430000 net acres in the barnett shale and a history of strong drilling results eog expects to continue to be an active driller in the fort worth basin barnett shale for many years

also during 2012 eog continued its strong liquids development in the rocky mountain area in the williston basin where production is approximately 85 crude oil 62 net wells were drilled in 2012 eog has continued its development of the turner sand formation in the powder river basin where eog has drilled 12 net wells each producing liquidsrich natural gas net average production for the entire rocky mountain area for 2012 was 518 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls an increase of 11 over the prior year natural gas production decreased 7 compared to 2011 levels as eog reduced its activity in the uinta basin drilling 18 net wells during 2012 consistent with its strategy to deemphasize natural gas drilling eog holds approximately 13 million net acres in the rocky mountain area and expects to drill 51 net wells in 2013

in 2012 eog drilled and participated in 105 net wells in the permian basin to develop its liquidsrich leonardavalon bone spring and wolfcamp plays eog is well positioned with approximately 73000 net acres in the leonardavalon shale and bone spring and 114000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale all within the delaware basin additionally eog has approximately 133000 net acres in the wolfcamp shale within the midland basin net production for 2012 averaged 165 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and 44 mmcfd of natural gas after divestitures in 2012 eog holds approximately 450000 net acres throughout the permian basin in 2013 eog plans to continue the expansion and development of the leonardavalon bone spring and wolfcamp plays by drilling 63 net wells

in the south texas area eog drilled 34 net wells in 2012 net production during 2012 averaged 52 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and 116 mmcfd of natural gas eogs activity was focused in san patricio nueces brooks kenedy and kleberg counties where eog will continue to exploit the liquidsrich frio and vicksburg sands utilizing vertical and horizontal well applications

  in december 2012 eog entered into a joint venture with respect to the king ranch ranch in south texas eog has assumed the operatorship and has acquired the right to explore on approximately 364000 gross acres eog has also assumed a 50 working interest in the production on the ranch as well as 50 of the plugging and abandonment cost liabilities and decommissioning cost liabilities for existing wells and certain facilities on the ranch current net production from the ranch is approximately 11 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 15 mbbld of ngls and 28 mmcfd of natural gas the exploration potential of the ranch includes the frio anomalina and vicksburg trends 

in the upper gulf coast region eog drilled 19 net wells and net production averaged 191 mmcfd of natural gas and 04 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2012 the haynesville and bossier shale plays located near the texaslouisiana border continue to be core natural gas assets eog controls 160000 net acres all within the highly productive areas of these plays due to low natural gas prices eog plans to defer drilling in the haynesville until natural gas economics support the activity eog holds a total of approximately 485000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region and plans to drill 15 net wells targeting crude oil projects during 2013

in 2012 eog continued to expand its activities in the midcontinent area with continued growth and extension of its western anadarko basin core area for the year eog averaged net production of 80 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls and 44 mmcfd of natural gas total liquids volumes increased 14 in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2012 eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the cleveland and marmaton sandstones drilling 35 net wells since 2002 eog has drilled over 270 net wells in these plays and holds approximately 125000 net acres throughout the trend in 2013 approximately 35 net wells are planned in order to further exploit these liquidsrich plays

during the first half of 2012 eog continued the development of its pennsylvania marcellus shale asset completing 19 net wells eog reduced its operations in the second half of 2012 dropping from 3 drilling rigs to 1 drilling rig with activities focused on its bradford county pennsylvania acreage in 2012 net gas production averaged approximately 43 mmcfd an increase of 24 from 2011 eog plans to drill 4 net wells in bradford county during 2013 for acreage retention eog holds approximately 170000 net acres in the pennsylvania marcellus shale play

at december 31 2012 eog held approximately 30 million net undeveloped acres in the united states

during 2012 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford shale in south texas eogowned natural gas processing capacity at december 31 2012 in the barnett shale and eagle ford shale was 120 mmcfd and 250 mmcfd respectively

in april 2012 a newlyconstructed crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana became operational owned by eog and nustar energy lp this facility provides access to one of the key premium markets in the us where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index the st james facility can accommodate multiple trains at a single time and has a capacity of approximately 120 mbbld eogs share of that capacity is 100 mbbld

additionally in support of its operations in the williston basin eog continued to increase the utilization of its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota to transport its crude oil production and crude oil purchased from thirdparty producers eog loaded 322 unit trains each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 70000 barrels of crude oil with crude oil for transport to stroud oklahoma st james louisiana and certain other destinations in the us

in stroud oklahoma eog owns a crude oil unloading facility and a pipeline to transport crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub these facilities have the capacity to unload approximately 90 mbbld of crude oil

in the south texas eagle ford eog continued to use its crude oil loading facility in harwood texas at this facility crude oil is loaded onto unit trains of approximately 70 cars each with aggregate capacity of approximately 45000 barrels per train and shipped to destinations on the us gulf coast during 2012 a total of 98 rail shipments were made from the harwood facility

in support of its permian basin operations eog commenced shipments from its barnhart texas crude oil loading facility in mid2012 and continues to increase shipments from that region to markets on the us gulf coast during 2012 eog shipped 24 unit trains from this facility each unit train currently consists of approximately 70 cars each with aggregate capacity of approximately 45000 barrels per train

eog believes that its crudebyrail facilities provide a distinct competitive advantage giving it the ability to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets

since 2008 eog has been operating its own sand mine and sand processing plant located in hood county texas helping to fulfill eogs sand needs for its well completion operations in the barnett shale combo play

at its second hood county sand processing plant that was purchased in 2011 eog continued to process raw eogowned sand from wisconsin after final processing at the hood county facility the sand is being utilized in completion operations in several key eog plays

eog also increased production of processed sand at its new stateoftheart chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant the plant processes sand from multiple nearby eogowned sand mines the first unit train of processed sand was dispatched from chippewa falls in january 2012 during 2012 eog shipped 70 sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each to a new eog sand storage facility in refugio texas

eog also installed and commissioned a resin coating plant at the refugio sand storage facility where sand can also be coated for added strength from refugio the sand is shipped primarily to the south texas eagle ford shale eog also ships its processed sand to other plays including the north dakota bakken and the permian basin

canada eog conducts operations in canada through its whollyowned subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from its offices in calgary alberta during 2012 eogrc continued its focus on horizontal crude oil growth mainly through its development of the shallow spearfish formation in southwest manitoba other drilling activity was directed to acreage retention in its bigger target horizontal natural gas play in the horn river basin of british columbia eogs entire acreage position in the horn river basin has now been converted from drilling licenses to production leases that will remain intact for a period of ten years from the conversion point of the 135 net wells eogrc drilled or participated in during 2012 124 were horizontal wells in oil plays 7 were horizontal natural gas acreage retention wells and the remaining 4 were vertical wells in 2013 eogrc will continue to develop its manitoba property and identify new targets in alberta in 2012 net crude oil and condensate and ngl production was 78 mbbld and net natural gas production was 95 mmcfd

at december 31 2012 eogrc held approximately 638000 net undeveloped acres in canada

eogrc owned a 30 interest in both the planned liquefied natural gas export terminal to be located near the port of kitimat british columbia kitimat lng terminal and the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp which is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the kitimat lng terminal in december 2012 eogrc signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp as well as approximately 28500 undeveloped net acres in the horn river basin to chevron canada limited the transaction closed in february 2013

several fields in the secc block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate production from both the toucan field in block 4a and the adjacent emz area began in february 2012 to supply natural gas under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc

during the fourth quarter of 2012 eog began drilling an exploratory well in the modified ua block which was successful this well and three additional development wells to be drilled in 2013 will be completed during the first half of 2013

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to ngc or its subsidiary in 2013 certain agreements with ngc require eogs trinidad operations to deliver approximately 470 mmcfd 360 mmcfd net of natural gas under current economic conditions eog intends to fulfill these natural gas delivery obligations by using production from existing proved reserves crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited

in 2012 eogs average net production from trinidad was 378 mmcfd of natural gas and 15 mbbld of crude oil and condensate

at december 31 2012 eog held approximately 39000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad

united kingdom eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk owns a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916a located in the southern gas basin of the north sea during 2012 production continued from the valkyrie field in this block

eoguk also owns a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea

in 2006 eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating working interest in this block a successful columbus natural gas prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc in the third quarter of 2012 with approval expected in the second quarter of 2013 the project participants are currently negotiating commercial agreements

in 2007 eoguk was awarded a license for two blocks in the east irish sea – blocks 1107b and 11012a in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea block 11012a well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans the field development plans for the conwycorfe project were approved by the decc in march 2012 the production platform was installed during the second quarter of 2012 and the pipelines were installed in the fourth quarter of 2012 eog expects to begin processing facility installation during the first half of 2013 the conwy development drilling program is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2013 with initial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2013

in 2009 eoguk was awarded a license for block 2112b in the central north sea where it expects to drill an exploratory well to test a crude oil prospect in late 2013 eoguk has 100 interest in this block

in 2012 production averaged 2 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom

at december 31 2012 eog held approximately 95000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom

china in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired

other international eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified

marketing

in 2012 eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate production was sold into local markets or transported either by pipeline truck or eogs crudebyrail assets to downstream markets in each case the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location major sales points included clearbrook minnesota cushing oklahoma st james louisiana and the us gulf coast in 2013 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2012 eog processed certain of its natural gas production either at eogowned plants or at thirdparty plants extracting ngls ngls were sold at prevailing market prices in 2013 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2012 eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold into local markets or transported by pipeline to downstream markets pricing based on the spot market and longterm natural gas contracts was at prevailing market prices in 2013 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2012 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2013

in 2012 all wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the 2013 marketing strategy for wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom is expected to remain the same eog is currently investigating possible marketing opportunities for its wellhead crude oil due to the anticipated start of eogs crude oil production in the united kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2013

in 2012 all of the wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2013

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities

during 2012 a single purchaser accounted for 198 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

wellhead volumes and prices

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas the table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 60 mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010

competition

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas moreover many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources

regulation

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion in addition numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry such rules and regulations among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments production taxes and ad valorem taxes

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm or in the case of offshore leases by the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm or the bsee

blm and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee under certain circumstances the blm boem or the bsee may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls by eog are made at unregulated market prices

eog owns certain gathering andor processing facilities in the barnett shale in north texas the bakken and three forks plays in north dakota and the eagle ford shale in south texas state regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs gathering and processing operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory agencies and courts will continue indefinitely

canadian regulation of crude oil and natural gas production  the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and gas industry with respect to taxes and factors affecting prices transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities or increase eogs costs and therefore may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties royalties payable on lands that the government has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing eogs revenues earnings and cash flow

environmental regulation  united states eog is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements

in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog previously owned or currently owns an interest but was or is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing

compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

climate change  united states  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions recent us epa rulemaking may result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the federal clean air act eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice

eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog is now reporting ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published in october 2009 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

hydraulic fracturing  united states  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that would otherwise not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations

currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements however there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in april 2012 the us epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds voc emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air the us epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment including storage tanks compressors dehydrators and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants in addition to these federal regulations some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the united states but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the oil and gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances into the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations however given that such laws and regulations are subject to change eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

as discussed above local provincial national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to work with the united states to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors in addition regulation of ghg emissions in canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level for example the governments of alberta and british columbia each regulate ghg emissions and the government of manitoba is currently considering the creation of a capandtrade system to reduce ghg emissions in manitoba canada was an original signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the kyoto protocol but canada withdrew from the kyoto protocol effective december 2012

in canada the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the provincial and local levels through permitting and other compliance requirements some provinces and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such provincial and local requirements restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in canada but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary

other regulation eog has sand mining and processing operations in texas and wisconsin which support eogs exploration and development operations eogs sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration in respect of safety and health matters and by state agencies in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by section 1503a of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item 104 of regulation sk 17 cfr 229104 is included in exhibit 95 to this report

other matters

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices for crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas crude oil and condensate and ngls production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2012 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2013 average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states and canada increased by 5 in 2012 24 in 2011 and 37 in 2010 each as compared to the immediately preceding year during the last three years average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically these fluctuations resulted in a 36 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states and canada in 2012 an 8 decrease in 2011 and an increase of 13 in 2010 each as compared to the immediately preceding year due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas prices in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors

including the impact of eogs 2013 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2013 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngls price is approximately 28 million for net income and 41 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2013 natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2013 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 18 million for net income and 27 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 21 2013 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2012 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily price swap option swaption collar and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 11 to consolidated financial statements in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 21 2013 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2012 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of crude oil and natural gas including blowouts rig and well explosions cratering fires and loss of well control each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident with respect to eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the specific event of a well blowout or outofcontrol well resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject with respect to its operations outside the united states

texas severance tax rate reduction  natural gas production from qualifying texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production however the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a wellbywell basis for a discussion of the impact on eog see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  operating and other expenses

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us our and eog refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries

a substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations

in addition if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor

our crude oil and natural gas operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities

our onshore and offshore operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses and liabilities as a result of

 

 

 

 

 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore exploration exploitation development and production activities and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering processing compression and transportation facilities are unavailable

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all in particular in certain newer shale plays the capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells in addition lack of financing construction and permitting delays permitting costs and other constraints could limit or delay the construction of new gathering processing compression and transportation facilities by third parties or us and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering processing compression or transportation facilities or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which could in turn impact our future cash flows and results of operations

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively by federal state and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

specifically as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations

in addition there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the us at the federal level currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the us is primarily conducted at the state level and in canada at the provincial and local levels through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions moreover some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations any such federal or state requirements restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation see climate change  united states hydraulic fracturing  united states and environmental regulation  canada under item 1 business  regulation

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions

certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation

legislation has been proposed that would if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws including the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies these changes include but are not limited to the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs it is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could become effective the enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions loss of gathering processing compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted our cash flows and in turn our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would reduce our cash flows further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all in addition weakness andor volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings a reduction in our cash flows for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak in addition there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in acquiring necessary services equipment materials and personnel in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated

estimating quantities of crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated also the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions or writedowns to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties  oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flows and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result relatively lower prices for natural gas production

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering processing compression and transportation facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk

we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swaps options swaptions collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts

recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which among other matters provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities although many of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act are yet to be adopted the cftc has issued several rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception and a rule imposing position limits position limits rule

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we will be eligible for and expect to utilize such exception as a result our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing however it remains uncertain whether margin requirements will be imposed on uncleared swaps the position limits rule was vacated and remanded to the cftc for further proceedings by order of the us district court for the district of columbia in september 2012 the doddfrank act the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and to the extent that a position limit rule is ultimately effected such position limit rule could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including costs related to requirements to post collateral materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and related regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditures requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 approximately 3 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas as well as discussion of eogs proved undeveloped reserves the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates by different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

in general the rate of production from eogs crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

acreage the following table summarizes eogs developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2012 excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests

 

most of our undeveloped oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally between three and five years approximately 08 million net acres will expire in 2013 07 million net acres will expire in 2014 and 05 million net acres will expire in 2015 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy

net income for 2012 totaled 570 million as compared to 1091 million for 2011 at december 31 2012 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 1811 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe a decrease of 243 mmboe from december 31 2011 during 2012 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by 276 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 3111 billion cubic feet or 519 mmboe

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2012

united states and canada eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and liquidsrich natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs in 2012 eog focused its efforts on developing its existing north american crude oil and liquidsrich acreage in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas exploration and development prospects during 2012 crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 46 of total company production as compared to 37 during 2011 in north america crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately 53 of total north american production during 2012 as compared to 42 in 2011 this liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the eagle ford shale near san antonio texas the north dakota bakken and the permian basin in 2012 eogs net eagle ford shale production averaged 835 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls as compared to 341 mbbld in 2011 based on current trends eog expects its 2013 crude oil and condensate and ngls production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2012 eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada

eog delivers its crude oil to various markets in the united states including sales points on the gulf coast where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index as part of its diversification strategy for its crudebyrail shipments in april 2012 eog completed the construction of a crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana where sales are based upon the lls crude oil index this facility which received the first unit train of eog crude oil in april 2012 has a capacity of approximately 120 mbbld of which 100 mbbld belongs to eog to support its permian basin operations eog commissioned a crude oil loading facility in barnhart texas in 2012 eog believes that its crudebyrail facilities provide a distinct competitive advantage giving it the ability to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets including both the gulf coast and cushing oklahoma markets additionally in july 2012 eog began shipping a portion of its eagle ford shale crude oil production to gulf coast sales points on the newly completed enterprise products partners lp crude oil pipeline

during 2012 eog increased production of processed sand at its stateoftheart chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant the plant processes sand from multiple nearby eogowned sand mines the first unit train of processed sand was dispatched from chippewa falls in january 2012 during 2012 eog shipped 70 sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each to a new eog sand storage facility in refugio texas where sand can also be coated for added strength from refugio the sand is shipped primarily to the south texas eagle ford shale eog also ships its processed sand to other plays including the north dakota bakken and the permian basin

eog resources canada inc eogrc owned a 30 interest in both the planned liquefied natural gas export terminal to be located near the port of kitimat british columbia kitimat lng terminal and the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp which is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the kitimat lng terminal in december 2012 eogrc signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp as well as approximately 28500 undeveloped net acres in the horn river basin to chevron canada limited the transaction closed in february 2013

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate in february 2012 production from both the toucan field in block 4a and the adjacent emz area began supplying natural gas under a contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago

during the fourth quarter of 2012 eog began drilling an exploratory well in the modified ua block which was successful this well and three additional wells to be drilled in 2013 will be completed in the first half of 2013

in 2006 eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating working interest in this block a successful columbus natural gas prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the third quarter of 2012 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the second quarter of 2013 the project participants are currently negotiating commercial agreements

in 2007 eoguk was awarded a license for two blocks in the east irish sea  blocks 1107b and 11012a in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea block 11012a well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans field development plans for the conwy and corfe fields were approved by the decc in march 2012 the production platform and pipelines were installed in 2012 and eog expects to begin processing facility installation during the first half of 2013 the conwy development drilling program is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2013 with initial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2013

in 2009 eoguk was awarded a license for block 2112b in the central north sea where it expects to drill an exploratory well to test a crude oil prospect in late 2013 eoguk has 100 interest in this block

in 2011 eog signed two exploration contracts and one farmin agreement covering approximately 80000 net acres in the neuquén basin in neuquén province argentina during the first half of 2012 eog participated in the drilling and completion of a vertical well in the bajo del toro block in the first half of 2012 eog drilled a well to monitor future well completions in the aguada del chivato block and drilled and completed a horizontal well in this block both the horizontal and vertical wells that were completed are under evaluation during the first quarter of 2013 eog plans to complete the monitoring well in the aguada del chivato block

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 32 and 28 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity

on september 10 2012 eog closed its sale of 1250 million aggregate principal amount of 2625 senior notes due 2023 notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15 2013 net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately 1234 million were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures

during 2012 eog funded 75 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations paid 181 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 59 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities net proceeds of 1234 million from the issuance of the notes proceeds of 1310 million from the sale of certain north american assets and proceeds of 83 million from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity

total anticipated 2013 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 70 billion to 72 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2013 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas drilling activity eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2013 eogs business plan includes selling certain noncore assets in 2013 realizing proceeds of approximately 550 million to cover the anticipated shortfall eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 2011 facility and equity and debt offerings

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history

results of operations

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f1

net operating revenues

during 2012 net operating revenues increased 1557 million or 15 to 11683 million from 10126 million in 2011 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2012 increased 1100 million or 16 to 7958 million from 6858 million in 2011 during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million compared to net gains of 626 million in 2011 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 981 million or 46 during 2012 to 3097 million from 2116 million in 2011 gains on asset dispositions net totaled 193 million and 493 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows

 1   thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

 

 

 

2012 compared to 2011 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2012 increased 1821 million or 47 to 5659 million from 3838 million in 2011 due to an increase of 45 mbbld or 39 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 1533 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 288 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford shale and bakken eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2012 increased 5 to 9777 per barrel compared to 9279 per barrel in 2011

ngls revenues in 2012 decreased 52 million or 7 to 727 million from 779 million in 2011 due to a lower composite average price 304 million partially offset by an increase of 14 mbbld or 32 in ngls deliveries 252 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford shale 7 mbbld the fort worth basin barnett shale 3 mbbld and the permian basin 2 mbbld eogs composite average ngls price in 2012 decreased 30 to 3554 per barrel compared to 5041 per barrel in 2011

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2012 decreased 669 million or 30 to 1572 million from 2241 million in 2011 the decrease was due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 554 million and decreased natural gas deliveries 115 million natural gas deliveries in 2012 decreased 86 mmcfd or 5 to 1516 mmcfd from 1602 mmcfd in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower production in the united states 79 mmcfd and canada 37 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in trinidad 34 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity the decrease in canada primarily reflects decreased production in alberta and the horn river basin area the increase in trinidad was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual deliveries eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 26 to 283 per mcf in 2012 from 383 per mcf in 2011

during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million which included net realized gains of 711 million during 2011 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 626 million which included net realized gains of 181 million

gathering processing and marketing revenues represent sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 gathering processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas purchases and sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs

during 2012 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased compared to 2011 primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2012 totaled 61 million compared to 44 million in 2011

2011 compared to 2010 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2011 increased 1839 million or 92 to 3838 million from 1999 million in 2010 due to an increase of 39 mbbld or 52 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 1074 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 765 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in texas 35 mbbld and colorado 3 mbbld production increases in texas were the result of increased production from the eagle ford shale 26 mbbld and fort worth basin barnett combo 8 mbbld plays eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2011 increased 25 to 9279 per barrel compared to 7429 per barrel in 2010

ngls revenues in 2011 increased 317 million or 69 to 779 million from 462 million in 2010 due to an increase of 12 mbbld or 39 in ngls deliveries 183 million and a higher composite average price 134 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale 6 mbbld the eagle ford shale 4 mbbld and the rocky mountain area 3 mbbld eogs composite average ngls price in 2011 increased 21 to 5041 per barrel compared to 4173 per barrel in 2010

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2011 decreased 179 million or 7 to 2241 million from 2420 million in 2010 the decrease was due to reduced natural gas deliveries 123 million and a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 56 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 3 to 383 per mcf in 2011 from 393 per mcf in 2010

natural gas deliveries in 2011 decreased 86 mmcfd or 5 to 1602 mmcfd from 1688 mmcfd in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower production in canada 68 mmcfd and the united states 20 mmcfd the decrease in canada primarily reflects sales of certain shallow natural gas assets in 2010 partially offset by increased production from the horn river basin area the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to decreased production in the rocky mountain area 36 mmcfd louisiana 17 mmcfd mississippi 11 mmcfd new mexico 8 mmcfd and kansas 5 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in texas 38 mmcfd and pennsylvania 23 mmcfd

during 2011 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 626 million which included net realized gains of 181 million during 2010 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net realized gains of 7 million

during 2011 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2011 increased 19 million to 44 million from 25 million in 2010 primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities

operating and other expenses

2012 compared to 2011  during 2012 operating expenses of 10203 million were 2190 million higher than the 8013 million incurred in 2011 the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda and ga for 2012 compared to 2011 are set forth below

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time in general operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas

lease and well expenses of 1000 million in 2012 increased 58 million from 942 million in 2011 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 60 million and trinidad 5 million and increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 15 million partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in canada 12 million and decreased workover expenditures in canada 6 million and the united states 5 million

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include transportation fees costs associated with crudebyrail operations the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees and fuel costs

transportation costs of 601 million in 2012 increased 171 million from 430 million in 2011 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford shale 101 million and the rocky mountain area 73 million

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance economic factors and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consists of gathering transportation and processing infrastructure assets compressors crudebyrail assets sand mine and sand processing assets vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software

dda expenses in 2012 increased 654 million to 3170 million from 2516 million in 2011 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2012 were 631 million higher than in 2011 primarily due to higher unit rates 379 million increased production in the united states 296 million and trinidad 7 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 57 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 331 million trinidad 33 million and canada 20 million

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 23 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the eagle ford shale

ga expenses of 332 million in 2012 were 27 million higher than 2011 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 22 million and higher information systems costs 5 million

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets

gathering and processing costs increased 17 million to 98 million in 2012 compared to 81 million in 2011 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford shale 21 million partially offset by decreased costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 7 million

exploration costs of 186 million in 2012 increased 14 million from 172 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased expenditures in the united states

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach as described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc for certain assets held for sale eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value

impairments of 1271 million in 2012 increased 240 million from 1031 million in 2011 primarily due to increased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada 534 million partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states 232 million and decreased amortization of unproved property costs 50 million in the united states eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties other property plant and equipment and other assets of 1133 million and 834 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2012 and 2011 amounts include impairments of 1022 million and 745 million related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets

taxes other than income in 2012 increased 84 million to 495 million 62 of wellhead revenues from 411 million 60 of wellhead revenues in 2011 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes in the united states 70 million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and a newly enacted fee imposed by the state of pennsylvania on certain wells drilled in the state in 2012 and prior years and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 30 million partially offset by decreased severanceproduction taxes in trinidad 17 million

other income net was 14 million in 2012 compared to 7 million in 2011 the increase of 7 million was primarily due to higher interest income 8 million primarily as a result of interest on severance tax refunds an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 8 million and higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 3 million partially offset by increased losses on warehouse stock 5 million and higher operating losses on eogs investment in the ptp 4 million

income tax provision of 710 million in 2012 decreased 109 million from 819 million in 2011 due primarily to lower pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2012 increased to 55 from 43 in 2011 the effective tax rate for 2012 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due primarily to foreign losses in canada 26 statutory tax rate and canadian valuation allowances

2011 compared to 2010  during 2011 operating expenses of 8013 million were 2436 million higher than the 5577 million incurred in 2010 the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010

 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 are set forth below

lease and well expenses of 942 million in 2011 increased 244 million from 698 million in 2010 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 188 million increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 33 million increased workover expenditures in the united states 11 million and canada 4 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in canada 4 million

transportation costs of 430 million in 2011 increased 45 million from 385 million in 2010 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the eagle ford shale 30 million the upper gulf coast region 16 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 9 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in canada 4 million the rocky mountain area 2 million and the south texas area 2 million the net increase in transportation costs primarily reflects increased volumes transported to downstream markets

dda expenses in 2011 increased 574 million to 2516 million from 1942 million in 2010 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2011 were 563 million higher than in 2010 primarily due to higher unit rates 375 million increased production in the united states 249 million a reduction during 2010 in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 24 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 11 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 77 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 306 million trinidad 37 million and canada 9 million

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 11 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the eagle ford shale 5 million and the rocky mountain area 3 million

ga expenses of 305 million in 2011 were 25 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs

net interest expense of 210 million in 2011 increased 80 million from 130 million in 2010 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 56 million lower capitalized interest 18 million and the writeoff of fees associated with revolving credit facilities cancelled in 2011 in connection with the establishment of the 2011 facility 6 million

gathering and processing costs increased 14 million to 81 million in 2011 compared to 67 million in 2010 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 10 million the eagle ford shale 5 million and canada 5 million partially offset by decreased activities in the upper gulf coast region 5 million and the rocky mountain area 4 million

exploration costs of 172 million in 2011 decreased 15 million from 187 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states

impairments of 1031 million in 2011 increased 288 million from 743 million in 2010 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment in the united states eog recorded impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment of 834 million and 526 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2011 amount includes impairments of 745 million related to certain north american natural gas assets as a result of declining commodity prices and accepted bids

taxes other than income in 2011 increased 94 million to 411 million 60 of wellhead revenues from 317 million 65 of wellhead revenues in 2010 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 101 million and a decrease in credits available to eog in 2011 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit 8 million partially offset by lower ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 9 million and canada 4 million and decreased severanceproduction taxes in trinidad 4 million

other income net was 7 million in 2011 compared to 14 million in 2010 the decrease of 7 million was primarily due to operating losses on eogs investment in the ptp 5 million and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses 5 million partially offset by higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 3 million

income tax provision of 819 million in 2011 increased 572 million from 247 million in 2010 due primarily to greater pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2011 decreased to 43 from 61 in 2010 the effective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due mostly to foreign earnings in trinidad 55 statutory tax rate combined with losses in canada 27 statutory tax rate

capital resources and liquidity

cash flow

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 were net funds generated from operations net proceeds from issuances of longterm debt proceeds from asset sales net proceeds from the sale of common stock proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities the primary uses of cash were exploration and development expenditures other property plant and equipment expenditures dividend payments and repayments of debt

2012 compared to 2011 net cash provided by operating activities of 5237 million in 2012 increased 659 million from 4578 million in 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues 1100 million and a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 531 million partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 422 million an increase in cash operating expenses 369 million and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes 100 million

net cash used in investing activities of 6119 million in 2012 increased by 364 million from 5755 million for the same period of 2011 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties 441 million and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets 123 million partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities 163 million and a decrease in additions to other property plant and equipment 37 million

net cash provided by financing activities of 1140 million in 2012 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes 1234 million proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity 83 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 67 million cash used in financing activities during 2012 included cash dividend payments 181 million and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans 59 million

total expenditures

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions

 

 

 

exploration and development expenditures of 6941 million for 2012 were 475 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 263 million the united kingdom 65 million argentina 41 million and canada 18 million increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 176 million and canada 27 million and increased exploration costs in the united states 14 million  these increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in trinidad 84 million decreased dry hole costs in the united states 29 million and decreased capitalized interest in the united states 8 million the 2012 exploration and development expenditures of 6941 million included 5989 million in development 901 million in exploration and 50 million in capitalized interest the 2011 exploration and development expenditures of 6466 million included 5797 million in development 607 million in exploration 58 million in capitalized interest and 4 million in property acquisitions in 2011 other property plant and equipment expenditures included 231 million for sand mine and sand processing assets the 2010 exploration and development expenditures of 5386 million included 4366 million in development 926 million in exploration 76 million in capitalized interest and 18 million in property acquisitions in 2010 other property plant and equipment expenditures included 210 million for the acquisition of galveston lng inc

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

derivative transactions

during 2012 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 394 million which included net realized gains of 711 million during 2011 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 626 million which included net realized gains of 181 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 32 at december 31 2012 compared to 28 at december 31 2011 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity

during 2012 the principal amount of total debt outstanding increased 1250 million to 6290 million at december 31 2012 from 5040 million at december 31 2011 the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 7032 million and 5657 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eogs debt such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow during 2012 eog entered into a capital lease transaction for the use of newly constructed crude oil storage tanks in the eagle ford shale at december 31 2012 the capital lease liability totaled 63 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements

during 2012 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the issuance of the notes as further described below proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2012 was 959 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2012 was 6 million with zero outstanding at yearend the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were 236 million and 41 thousand respectively during the year 2012 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by its 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs

on september 10 2012 eog closed its sale of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of the notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15 2013 net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately 1234 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2012 in thousands

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2012 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2012 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2012 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc under those provisions as of december 31 2012 eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of 55 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in an increase of 1 million to accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook

pricing crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate ngls natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas in 2013 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position see item 1a risk factors

including the impact of eogs 2013 crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2013 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the estimated change in ngls price is approximately 28 million for net income and 41 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2013 natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2013 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 18 million for net income and 27 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 21 2013 see derivative transactions above

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states in particular eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford bakken and three forks plays and to a lesser extent liquidsrich natural gas drilling united states natural gas drilling activity will be limited to that necessary to hold acreage primarily in the marcellus in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities

the total anticipated 2013 capital expenditures of 70 to 72 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain noncore assets eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2013 eogs business plan includes selling certain noncore assets in 2013 realizing proceeds of approximately 550 million to cover the anticipated shortfall however eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2013 by 4 over 2012 levels total liquids production is expected to increase by 23 comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and ngls production of 28 and 10 respectively north american natural gas production is expected to decrease by 15 from 2012 levels

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their application critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

oil and gas exploration costs

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2012 and 2011 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 15 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the past five years west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 3400 per barrel to 14500 per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 182 per mmbtu to 1331 per mmbtu eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if actual crude oil andor natural gas prices andor actual production diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances

stockbased compensation

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards expected volatility of the price of shares of eogs peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

general 

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us canada the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the united kingdom uk the peoples republic of china china the argentine republic argentina and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is httpwwweogresourcescom 

at december 31 2011 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2054 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 517 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 228 mmbbl were natural gas liquids reserves and 7851 billion cubic feet bcf or 1309 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 85 of eogs net proved reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 9 in canada and 6 in trinidad crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using the ratio of 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids to 60 thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas 

as of december 31 2011 eog employed approximately 2550 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis eog is focused on costeffective utilization of advanced technology associated with threedimensional seismic and microseismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives for horizontal drilling formation evaluation and horizontal completion methods these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage

exploration and production 

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada with a current focus on liquidsrich plays 

at december 31 2011 39 of eogs net proved reserves in the united states and canada on a crude oil equivalent basis were crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 61 were natural gas reserves substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of the applicable technologies described above eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2011 and certain 2012 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states the liquidsrich eagle ford shale has proven to be among eogs most economically attractive resource plays to date the eagle ford has welldefined crude oil wet gas and dry gas trends eogs total acreage position in all three hydrocarbon trends totals 647000 net acres eog has focused its drilling on its highly productive 572000 net acreage position within the oil window where eog has drilled a cumulative 356 net wells eogs strategy is to maintain its entire ownership interests and not to dilute its position by taking on a joint venture partner in this play eog is the largest oil producer in the eagle ford where its net production in 2011 was 302 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate 39 mbbld of natural gas liquids and 21 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas this represents more than a sixfold yearoveryear increase in production eog drilled 269 net wells in 2011 and plans to drill and complete approximately 280 net wells in 2012 

in 2011 eog increased activity in the liquidsrich barnett shale combo play of the fort worth basin where total production grew by approximately 105 above 2010 levels including a 107 increase in liquids production during the year eog completed 269 net barnett combo wells and increased its drilling potential in this liquidsrich play by expanding the core area from approximately 175000 to approximately 200000 net acres eogs total 2011 barnett shale average net daily production increased to approximately 377 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 403 mmcfd of natural gas for 2012 eog will continue to focus on this play with plans to complete to sales an additional 200 net barnett shale combo wells in the natural gas portion of the barnett shale eog plans to complete to sales approximately 35 net wells the rich natural gas from the majority of these wells will be processed to recover natural gas liquids with a large acreage position of approximately 506000 net acres in the barnett shale and a history of strong drilling results eog expects to continue to be an active driller in the fort worth basin barnett shale for many years 

eog maintained a strong and consistent development program throughout the rocky mountain area in 2011 eog continued its development programs in the williston dj and uinta basins drilling 79 net wells 36 net wells and 33 net wells respectively eog also resumed exploration and development activities in the powder river basin during 2011 drilling six net wells net average production for the entire rocky mountain area for 2011 was 466 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids an increase of 13 over the prior year natural gas production was down 17 from 2010 levels primarily due to divestitures and deemphasized natural gas drilling eog holds approximately 16 million net acres in the rocky mountain area for 2012 eog intends to maintain a steady development program throughout the rocky mountain area where it plans to drill 123 net wells 

in 2011 eog drilled and participated in 56 net wells in the permian basin to test the leonardavalon shale bone spring and wolfcamp formations eog is well positioned in these three established plays the leonardavalon shale and bone spring plays in the delaware basin and the wolfcamp shale in the midland basin net production for the year 2011 averaged 105 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 49 mmcfd of natural gas after divestitures in 2011 eog now controls approximately 480000 net acres throughout the permian basin with approximately 130000 acres within the wolfcamp shale formation and 106000 acres within the limits of the bone spring and leonardavalon shale formations in 2012 eog plans to continue the development expansion and enhancement of the wolfcamp leonardavalon and bone spring plays by drilling 112 net wells while continuing to look for new liquidsrich plays 

  

  

in 2011 eog continued to expand its activities in the midcontinent area with continued growth and extension of its western anadarko basin core area for the year eog averaged net production of 71 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 52 mmcfd of natural gas total crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids volumes increased 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 in 2011 eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the cleveland sandstone drilling 11 net wells with initial average gross production rates of approximately 350 barrels per day bbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids per well since 2002 eog has drilled over 230 net wells in this play and holds approximately 100000 net acres throughout the trend in the recently discovered marmaton sandstone play where it holds approximately 80000 net acres eog drilled a total of 18 net wells in 2011 with an initial average gross production rate of 550 bbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids per well in 2012 approximately 40 net wells are planned in order to further exploit these liquidsrich plays 

in the south texas area eog drilled 47 net wells in 2011 net production during 2011 averaged 64 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 151 mmcfd of natural gas eogs activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio nueces brooks and kenedy counties eog will continue to focus on drilling liquidsrich wells in the lobo and roleta trends the frio and vicksburg trends and the nueces wilcox trend eog holds approximately 364500 net acres in south texas approximately 43 net wells are planned for south texas during 2012 eogs gulf of mexico production of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids averaged approximately 75 bbld for the year ended december 31 2011 thus eogs offshore operations in the gulf of mexico are immaterial in relation to eogs overall operations and production moreover eog does not have any plans for future offshore drilling in the gulf of mexico 

in the upper gulf coast region eog drilled 47 net wells and net production averaged 227 mmcfd of natural gas and 10 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2011 the haynesville and bossier shale plays located near the texaslouisiana border continue to be core natural gas assets for eog the drilling program has increased from 13 net wells in 2009 to 40 net wells in 2011 eog expanded the texas sweet spot in 2011 with excellent well results in southern nacogdoches and angelina counties eog now controls 175000 net acres in this play and most of this acreage is within a welldefined productive sweet spot eog holds a total of approximately 384000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region due to low natural gas prices eog plans to reduce activity and drill approximately 25 net wells in the upper gulf coast region in 2012 including 15 net wells in the haynesville 

during 2011 eog continued the development of its pennsylvania marcellus shale asset and drilled a total of 27 net wells nine net wells were drilled in bradford county in northeastern pennsylvania and seven net wells were completed the remaining 18 net wells were drilled in north central pennsylvania as part of eogs joint venture with seneca resources corporation where eog is operator and holds a 50 working interest eogs net natural gas production averaged 33 mmcfd in 2011 up from 12 mmcfd in 2010 eog currently holds in excess of 200000 net acres in the pennsylvania marcellus shale and plans to drill an estimated 35 net wells during 2012 

at december 31 2011 eog held approximately 36 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2011 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the barnett shale of north texas and the bakken and three forks plays of north dakota eog also installed field gathering and conditioning facilities in the eagle ford play of south texas eogowned natural gas processing capacity at december 31 2011 in the barnett shale and eagle ford was 120 mmcfd and 135 mmcfd respectively 

during june 2011 eog sold its stanley north dakota condensate recovery unit and 76mile 12inch diameter dense phase natural gas pipeline in connection with the sale eog entered into an agreement with the buyer to reserve capacity in both the condensate recovery unit and the pipeline the pipeline connects with the alliance pipeline which transports natural gas to the chicago illinois area 

additionally in support of its operations in the williston basin eog increased utilization of its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota to transport its oil production and oil purchased from thirdparty producers using this facility during 2011 eog loaded 200 unit trains each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 68000 barrels of crude oil with crude oil for transport to stroud oklahoma and certain destinations on the us gulf coast in stroud oklahoma eog owns a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub together these facilities have the capacity to loadunload approximately 70 mbbld of crude oil 

  

  

in the south texas eagle ford eog established a crude oil loading facility in harwood texas that became operational in april 2011 at this facility crude oil is loaded onto unit trains of approximately 70 cars each with capacity of approximately 46000 barrels per train and is shipped to destinations on the us gulf coast during 2011 a total of 45 shipments were made from the harwood facility 

in order to access more diverse markets for its crudebyrail shipments during 2011 eog began construction of a crude oil unloading facility in st james louisiana where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet price this facility which is scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of 2012 will have a capacity of approximately 100 mbbld and be able to accommodate   multiple trains at a single time 

eog believes that its crudebyrail facilities uniquely position it to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car from north dakota and texas to the most favorable markets 

since 2008 eog has been operating its own sand mine and sand processing plant located in hood county texas helping to fulfill eogs sand needs in the barnett shale combo play 

during 2011 eog increased its sand mining and processing operations to supply sand for its well completion operations eog purchased a second processing plant in hood county texas in 2011 and began regular shipments of eogowned unprocessed sand from wisconsin after final processing at the hood county facility the sand is being utilized in key eog plays 

during december 2011 eog completed and placed in operation its new stateoftheart chippewa falls wisconsin sand plant to process sand from a nearby eogowned sand mine the first unit train of processed sand was dispatched from chippewa falls at the beginning of january 2012 the majority of the initial trains are destined for a new eog sand facility in refugio texas one to two sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each are expected to arrive at refugio every week as operations in chippewa falls ramp up from there the sand will be shipped primarily to the south texas eagle ford play 

canada eog conducts operations through its whollyowned subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from its offices in calgary alberta during 2011 eogrc continued its focus on horizontal crude oil growth mainly through its drilling activity in waskada manitoba other drilling activity was directed to acreage retention in its bigger target horizontal natural gas play in the horn river basin of british columbia during 2011 eogrc drilled or participated in 101 net wells all of which were horizontal wells correspondingly net crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by 16 to 88 mbbld net natural gas production decreased 34 to 132 mmcfd reflecting a deemphasis on gas drilling and eogrcs sale of several shallow gas properties in late 2010 the focus on crude oil production growth will continue in 2012 with 133 net wells planned in a combination of plays from the continued development in manitoba and new targets in alberta eog plans to drill seven net wells in the horn river basin for acreage retention in 2012 

at december 31 2011 eogrc held approximately 749000 net undeveloped acres in canada 

in march 2011 eogrc purchased an additional 245 interest in the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp for 252 million the ptp is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the planned liquefied natural gas lng export terminal to be located at bish cove near the port of kitimat north of vancouver british columbia kitimat lng terminal a portion of the purchase price 153 million was paid at closing with the remaining amount to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the kitimat lng terminal additionally in march 2011 eogrc and an affiliate of apache corporation apache through a series of transactions sold a portion of their interests in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp to an affiliate of encana corporation encana subsequent to these transactions ownership interests in both the kitimat lng terminal and ptp are apache operator 40 eogrc 30 and encana 30 all future costs of the project will be paid by each party in proportion to its respective ownership percentage in the first quarter of 2011 eogrc and apache awarded a frontend engineering and design contract to a global engineering company with the final report expected in the second half 2012 in october 2011 the canadian national energy board granted a 20year export license to ship lng from the kitimat lng terminal to international markets 

  

  

operations outside the united states and canada 

eog has operations offshore trinidad the uk north sea and east irish sea the china sichuan basin and the neuquén basin of argentina and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas 

trinidad  eog through several of its subsidiaries including eog resources trinidad limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several fields in the secc block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate in block 4a eog drilled and completed six development wells in the toucan field and one in the sercan field in 2011 production from both the toucan field and emz area began in february 2012 to supply natural gas under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc eog sourced the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the toucan field began producing 

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to ngc or its subsidiary certain agreements with ngc require eogs trinidad operations to deliver in 2012 approximately 520 mmcfd 370 mmcfd net of natural gas under current economic conditions eog intends to fulfill these natural gas delivery obligations by using production from existing proved reserves crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago 

in 2011 eogs average net production from trinidad was 344 mmcfd of natural gas and 34 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

at december 31 2011 eog held approximately 39000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk owns a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916a located in the southern gas basin of the north sea during 2011 production continued from the valkyrie field in this block 

eoguk also owns a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea 

in 2006 eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating interest in this block a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the first half of 2012 the operator and partners are continuing to negotiate processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners 

  

  

in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea blocks 1107b and 11012a well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans during 2011 offshore facilities fabrication began line pipe was fabricated and all principal facilities and drilling contracts were signed field development plans for the conwy and corfe fields were submitted to the decc during the first quarter of 2011 regulatory approval of both plans is expected during the first quarter of 2012 installation of facilities pipelines and drilling of development wells are planned for 2012 with initial production expected during the first quarter of 2013 the licenses for the east irish sea blocks were awarded to eoguk in 2007 

in 2011 production averaged 3 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom 

at december 31 2011 eog held approximately 95000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

china in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired during the first quarter of 2011 eog completed one horizontal well 

in 2011 production averaged 10 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

at december 31 2011 eog held approximately 131000 net acres in china 

argentina  during 2011 eog signed two exploration contracts and one farmin agreement covering approximately 100000 net acres in the neuquén basin in neuquén province argentina during the third quarter of 2011 eog performed exploration activity on a portion of this acreage in preparation for drilling a well targeting the vaca muerta oil shale in the aguada del chivato block eog began drilling this well in january 2012 in the first quarter of 2012 eog plans to participate in drilling a second well in the bajo del toro block targeting the vaca muerta oil shale 

other international eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

wellhead marketing substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids are sold under various terms and arrangements based on prevailing market prices 

in 2011 eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts based on prevailing market prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximated the prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market in 2012 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2011 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2012 

in 2011 all wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the 2012 marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom is expected to remain the same 

in 2011 all of the wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2012 

  

  

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities 

during 2011 a single purchaser accounted for 101 of eogs total wellhead crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues and gathering processing and marketing revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas moreover many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds regulate environmental and safety matters and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee all federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the bsee 

blm and boem leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boem or bsee such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior boem andor bsee approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the requirements for removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the boem or bsee may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

  

  

eog owns certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory agencies and courts will continue indefinitely 

canadian regulation of crude oil and natural gas production  the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and gas industry with respect to taxes and factors affecting prices transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities or increase eogs costs and therefore may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties royalties payable on lands that the government has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing eogs revenues earnings and cash flow 

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations these laws and regulations could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control and under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of thirdparty sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such thirdparty sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and 

  

  

may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

climate change  local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions recent us epa rulemaking may result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the federal clean air act eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and is a generally good business practice 

eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog is now reporting ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published on october 30 2009 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

hydraulic fracturing  most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that would otherwise not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 of highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations 

currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in addition to these federal proposals some states and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal state and local permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

  

  

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the oil and gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances into the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or may result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under canadian laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition or results of operations it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition and results of operations 

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to work with the united states to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors with a stated goal to reduce canadas total ghg emissions by 17 from 2005 levels by 2020 in addition regulation of ghg emissions in canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level for example the alberta government regulates ghg emissions under the climate change and emissions management act the specified gas reporting regulation which imposes ghg emissions reporting requirements and the specified gas emitters regulation which imposes ghg emissions limits british columbia regulates ghg emissions under the greenhouse gas reduction targets act the greenhouse gas reduction cap and trade act which imposes hard caps on ghg emissions and the reporting regulation which requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions in addition the government of manitoba is currently considering the creation of a capandtrade system to reduce ghg emissions in manitoba canada was an original signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the kyoto protocol but canada recently announced its withdrawal from the kyoto protocol effective december 2012 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs of compliance within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs operations financial condition and results of operations eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

  

  

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices for crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2011 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2012 average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states and canada increased by 24 in 2011 increased by 37 in 2010 and decreased by 38 in 2009 each as compared to the immediately preceding year the average new york mercantile exchange nymex crude oil strip price for 2012 has increased approximately 7 subsequent to december 31 2011 average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in an 8 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states and canada in 2011 an increase of 13 in 2010 and a decrease of 54 in 2009 each as compared to the immediately preceding year the average nymex natural gas strip price for 2012 has decreased by approximately 6 since december 31 2011 due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availability of other energy supplies the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas prices in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2012 crude oil derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2012 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 31 million for net income and 46 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2012 natural gas derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2012 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 11 million for net income and 16 million for cash flows from operating activities for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2012 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2011 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily collar price swap option and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 11 to consolidated financial statements in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the accounting standards codification these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2012 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2011 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of crude oil and natural gas including blowouts rig and well explosions cratering fires and loss of well control each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

 

 

  

  

 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident with respect to eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the specific event of a well blowout or outofcontrol well resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog all of eogs onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us and our refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

a substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices would have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids and condensate fluctuate widely among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

  

  

in addition if we expect significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices in the future such that the expected future cash flow from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally see the immediately following risk factor 

our crude oil and natural gas operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 

our onshore and offshore operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for and producing gathering processing and transporting crude oil and natural gas including the risks of 

  

  ·   well blowouts and cratering 

  ·   loss of well control 

  ·   crude oil spills natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures 

  ·   pipe failures and casing collapses 

  ● uncontrollable flows of crude oil natural gas formation water or drilling fluids 

  ·   releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances 

  ● adverse weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes and other natural disasters 

  ·   fires and explosions 

 

  

  

·   terrorism or vandalism 

·   formations with abnormal pressures and 

·   malfunctions of gathering processing and other equipment 

if any of these events occur we could incur losses and liabilities as a result of 

 

·   injury or loss of life 

  ·   damage to or destruction of property equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs 

  ·   pollution or other environmental damage 

  ● regulatory investigations and penalties as well as cleanup and remediation responsibilities and costs 

·   suspension or interruption of our operations including due to injunction and 

·   repairs necessary to resume operations 

 

we maintain insurance against many but not all such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore exploration exploitation development and production activities and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering processing compression and transportation services 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which could in turn impact our future cash flow and results of operations 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively by federal state and local governments and regulatory agencies both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

specifically as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

local state national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions we are also aware of legislation proposed by us lawmakers and by the canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce ghg emissions 

additionally there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by eog are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing some states and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on the access to and usage of water disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing accordingly our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected for additional discussion regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing see environmental regulation – united states and environmental regulation – canada under item 1 business – regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for related discussion see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including but not limited to as a result of accidents weather conditions loss of gathering processing compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted our cash flow and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

  

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects in addition a thirdparty operator could also decide to shutin or curtail production from wells or plug and abandon marginal wells on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements moreover there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations commercial paper borrowings sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all the weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings moreover a reduction in our cash flow for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak in addition there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights or in acquiring necessary services equipment supplies and personnel in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated moreover the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

  

  

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties – oil and gas exploration and production – properties and reserves 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flow and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result relatively lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial collars price swaps and basis swaps to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 

as discussed in the risk factor immediately above we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which among other matters establishes a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives or swaps the us securities and exchange commission which has jurisdiction over securitybased swaps and the commodity futures trading commission which has jurisdiction over swaps are in the process of adopting regulations to implement this new regulatory regime once implemented entities such as eog that enter into swaps will be subject to among other provisions swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements position limits for certain referenced futures contracts in the major energy markets and economically equivalent futures options and swaps and subject to certain exceptions which may be applicable to eog swap clearing trade execution and margin requirements ie collateral posting requirements our swap counterparties could be subject to even greater regulatory oversight and may be subject to regulated capital requirements 

  

  

the applicability of such provisions and the availability of certain exemptions to eog our hedging activities and our hedging counterparties is currently uncertain as many of the implementing regulations have not been finalized however the legislation and related regulations could significantly increase our cost of compliance increase the cost and alter the terms of derivatives transactions and adversely impact the number and creditworthiness of available swap counterparties all of this could impact our available liquidity require us to divert funds away from our exploration development and production activities eg in order to satisfy margincollateral posting requirements and reduce our ability to hedge and otherwise manage our financial and commercial risks related to crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and related regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flow may be less predictable which could materially and adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of the foregoing consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 approximately 5 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

  

  

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as discussion of eogs proved undeveloped reserves the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

in general the rate of production from eogs crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

net income for 2011 totaled 1091 million as compared to 161 million for 2010 at december 31 2011 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 2054 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 104 mmboe from december 31 2010 during 2011 net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids reserves increased by 207 million barrels mmbbl and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 619 billion cubic feet bcf or 103 mmboe 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2011 

united states and canada eogs efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquidsrich reservoirs in 2011 eog focused its efforts on developing its existing north american crude oil and condensate and liquidsrich acreage in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential liquidsrich exploration and development prospects during 2011 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 37 of total company production as compared to 27 during 2010 north american liquids production accounted for approximately 42 of total north american production during 2011 as compared to 31 in 2010 this liquids growth reflects production from eogs 572000 net acre position in the oil window of the eagle ford shale play near san antonio texas and increasing amounts of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in the fort worth basin barnett shale area in 2011 eogs net eagle ford shale production averaged 341 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 43 mbbld in 2010 based on current trends eog expects its 2012 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2011 eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada eog delivers its crude oil to various markets in the united states including sales points on the gulf coast most recently with increases in crude oil production from the eagle ford shale play eog has increased sales to the gulf coast and is receiving pricing for those sales based on the light louisiana sweet price in order to create further market diversification for its growing crude oil production eog is expanding its crudebyrail system to have the capability to increase deliveries of crude oil to st james louisiana beginning in the second quarter of 2012 in addition to further reduce well completion costs eog began using sand from its wisconsin sand mine and sand processing facilities in late 2011 

  

  

in march 2011 eogs whollyowned canadian subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc purchased an additional 245 interest in the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp for 252 million the ptp is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the planned liquefied natural gas lng export terminal to be located at bish cove near the port of kitimat north of vancouver british columbia kitimat lng terminal a portion of the purchase price 153 million was paid at closing with the remaining amount to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the kitimat lng terminal additionally in march 2011 eogrc and an affiliate of apache corporation apache through a series of transactions sold a portion of their interests in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp to an affiliate of encana corporation encana subsequent to these transactions ownership interests in both the kitimat lng terminal and ptp are apache operator 40 eogrc 30 and encana 30 all future costs of the project will be paid by each party in proportion to its respective ownership percentage in the first quarter of 2011 eogrc and apache awarded a frontend engineering and design contract to a global engineering company with the final report expected in the second half of 2012 in october 2011 the canadian national energy board granted a 20year export license to ship lng from the kitimat lng terminal to international markets 

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate in block 4a eog drilled and completed six development wells in the toucan field and one in the emz area in 2011 production from all seven wells began in february 2012 to supply natural gas under a contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago eog sourced the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the toucan field began producing 

in 2006 eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating interest in this block a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the first half of 2012 the operator and partners are continuing to negotiate processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners 

in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea blocks 1107b and 11012a well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans during 2011 offshore facilities fabrication began line pipe was fabricated and all principal facilities and drilling contracts were signed field development plans for the conwy and corfe fields were submitted to the decc during the first quarter of 2011 regulatory approval of both plans is expected during the first quarter of 2012 installation of facilities pipelines and drilling of development wells are planned for 2012 with initial production expected during the first quarter of 2013 the licenses for the east irish sea blocks were awarded to eoguk in 2007 

in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired during the first quarter of 2011 eog completed one horizontal well 

during 2011 eog signed two exploration contracts and one farmin agreement covering approximately 100000 net acres in the neuquén basin in neuquén province argentina during the third quarter of 2011 eog performed exploration activity on a portion of this acreage in preparation for drilling a well targeting the vaca muerta oil shale in the aguada del chivato block eog began drilling this well in january 2012 in the first quarter of 2012 eog plans to participate in the drilling of a second well in the bajo de toro block targeting the vaca muerta oil shale 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

  

  

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 and 34 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

during 2011 eog funded 71 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations repaid 220 million in longterm debt paid 167 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 24 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities proceeds of 1388 million from the sale of common stock and proceeds of 1433 million from the sale of certain north american assets and the sale of a portion of eogs interest in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp 

on october 11 2011 eog entered into a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 2011 facility with domestic and foreign lenders the 2011 facility replaced eogs two 10 billion senior unsecured credit facilities which were cancelled by eog upon the closing of the 2011 facility unamortized fees relating to the cancelled facilities totaling 57 million were written off in the fourth quarter of 2011 the 2011 facility has a scheduled maturity date of october 11 2016 and includes an option for eog to extend on up to two occasions the term for successive oneyear periods 

on march 7 2011 eog completed the sale of 13570000 shares of eog common stock par value 001 per share common stock at the public offering price of 10550 per share net proceeds from the sale of the common stock were approximately 1388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes including funding capital expenditures 

total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures are expected to range from 74 to 76 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2012 expenditures will be focused on united states and canada crude oil and liquidsrich gas drilling activity and to a much lesser extent natural gas drilling activity in the haynesville marcellus and british columbia horn river basin plays to hold acreage eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012 eogs business plan includes selling certain noncore assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall however eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under the 2011 facility and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

  

  

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues 

during 2011 net operating revenues increased 4026 million or 66 to 10126 million from 6100 million in 2010 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2011 increased 1977 million or 41 to 6858 million from 4881 million in 2010 during 2011 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 626 million compared to net gains of 62 million in 2010 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 1206 million or 133 during 2011 to 2116 million from 910 million in 2010 gains on asset dispositions net totaled 493 million and 224 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily as a result of asset dispositions in the rocky mountain area and texas in 2011 and in the rocky mountain area in 2010 

  

  

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

 

1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

 

 

 

  

  

2011 compared to 2010 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2011 increased 1839 million or 92 to 3838 million from 1999 million in 2010 due to an increase of 39 mbbld or 52 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 1074 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 765 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in texas 35 mbbld and colorado 3 mbbld production increases in texas were the result of increased production from the eagle ford shale 26 mbbld and fort worth basin barnett combo 8 mbbld plays eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2011 increased 25 to 9279 per barrel compared to 7429 per barrel in 2010

operating and other expenses 

2011 compared to 2010  during 2011 operating expenses of 8013 million were 2436 million higher than the 5577 million incurred in 2010   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 are set forth below 

  

  

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance costs include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time in general operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas 

lease and well expenses of 942 million in 2011 increased 244 million from 698 million in 2010 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 188 million increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 33 million increased workover expenditures in the united states 11 million and canada 4 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in canada 4 million 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs transportation fees and costs associated with crudebyrail operations 

transportation costs of 430 million in 2011 increased 45 million from 385 million in 2010 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the eagle ford shale 30 million the upper gulf coast area 16 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 9 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in canada 4 million the rocky mountain area 2 million and the south texas area 2 million the net increase in transportation costs primarily reflects increased volumes transported to downstream markets 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consists of gathering and processing assets compressors crudebyrail assets sand mine and sand processing assets vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software 

dda expenses in 2011 increased 574 million to 2516 million from 1942 million in 2010 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2011 were 563 million higher than in 2010 primarily due to higher unit rates as described above 375 million increased production in the united states 249 million a reduction during 2010 in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 24 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 11 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 77 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 306 million trinidad 37 million and canada 9 million 

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 11 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the eagle ford shale 5 million and the rocky mountain area 3 million 

ga expenses of 305 million in 2011 were 25 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 

  

  

net interest expense of 210 million in 2011 increased 80 million from 130 million in 2010 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 56 million lower capitalized interest 18 million and the writeoff of fees associated with revolving credit facilities cancelled in 2011 in connection with the establishment of the 2011 facility 6 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets 

gathering and processing costs increased 14 million to 81 million in 2011 compared to 67 million in 2010 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 10 million the eagle ford shale 5 million and canada 5 million partially offset by decreased activities in the upper gulf coast region 5 million and the rocky mountain area 4 million 

exploration costs of 172 million in 2011 decreased 15 million from 187 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other property plant and equipment unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach as described in the fair value measurement and disclosures topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc for certain natural gas assets held for sale eog utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 

impairments of 1031 million in 2011 increased 288 million from 743 million in 2010 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment in the united states eog recorded impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment of 834 million and 526 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2011 amount includes impairments of 745 million related to certain north american natural gas assets as a result of declining commodity prices and accepted bids 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2011 increased 94 million to 411 million 6 of wellhead revenues from 317 million 65 of wellhead revenues in 2010 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 101 million and a decrease in credits available to eog in 2011 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit 8 million partially offset by lower ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 9 million and canada 4 million and decreased severanceproduction taxes in trinidad 4 million 

other income net was 7 million in 2011 compared to 14 million in 2010 the decrease of 7 million was primarily due to operating losses on eogs investment in the ptp 5 million and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses 5 million partially offset by higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 3 million 

  

  

income tax provision of 819 million in 2011 increased 572 million from 247 million in 2010 due primarily to greater pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2011 decreased to 43 from 61 in 2010 the effective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate 35 due mostly to foreign earnings in trinidad 55 statutory tax rate combined with losses in canada 27 statutory tax rate 

2010 compared to 2009  during 2010 operating expenses of 5577 million were 1761 million higher than the 3816 million incurred in 2009   the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below 

lease and well expenses of 698 million in 2010 increased 119 million from 579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 67 million and canada 6 million increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 27 million primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 14 million and increased workover expenditures in the united states 3 million and canada 2 million 

transportation costs of 385 million in 2010 increased 102 million from 283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 46 million the upper gulf coast area 29 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 29 million these increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets the increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area also include costs associated with eogs crudebyrail operations which began transporting crude oil from stanley north dakota to cushing oklahoma at the end of december 2009 

dda expenses in 2010 increased 393 million to 1942 million from 1549 million in 2009 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were 378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 97 million trinidad 12 million and china 2 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 8 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 167 million canada 86 million trinidad 12 million and china 8 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 28 million partially offset by a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 24 million 

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the rocky mountain area 10 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 4 million 

ga expenses of 280 million in 2010 were 32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 10 million higher legal and other professional fees 7 million and higher information systems costs 3 million 

  

  

net interest expense of 130 million in 2010 increased 29 million from 101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 50 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 21 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 9 million to 67 million in 2010 compared to 58 million in 2009 the increase reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 6 million and the rocky mountain area 3 million 

exploration costs of 187 million in 2010 increased 17 million from 170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employeerelated costs in the united states 

impairments of 743 million in 2010 increased 437 million from 306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment in canada eog recorded impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment of 526 million and 94 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2010 eog recorded a pretax impairment of 280 million to adjust certain canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell see note 16 to consolidated financial statements additionally eog recorded pretax impairments of 170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain north american onshore and offshore natural gas assets 

taxes other than income in 2010 increased 143 million to 317 million 65 of wellhead revenues from 174 million 51 of wellhead revenues in 2009 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 56 million trinidad 22 million and canada 6 million a decrease in credits available to eog in 2010 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit 43 million and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 14 million 

other income net was 14 million in 2010 compared to 2 million in 2009 the increase of 12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 9 million 

income tax provision of 247 million in 2010 decreased 78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61 from 37 in 2009 the increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate was primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in trinidad and canadian book losses which resulted largely from the impairment of certain canadian shallow natural gas assets the statutory tax rates in the united states and trinidad are higher than the canadian statutory rate 

  

  

capital resources and liquidity

total expenditures 

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

exploration and development expenditures of 6466 million for 2011 were 1080 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 1421 million and the united kingdom 62 million increased dry hole costs in china 22 million and unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in canada 15 million these increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in canada 181 million and china 70 million decreased leasehold acquisitions expenditures in the united states 90 million and canada 8 million decreased dry hole costs in the united kingdom 22 million canada 14 million and trinidad 5 million decreased capitalized interest in the united states 18 million decreased property acquisition expenditures in the united states 14 million and decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 13 million the 2011 exploration and development expenditures of 6466 million included 5797 million in development 607 million in exploration 58 million in capitalized interest and 4 million in property acquisitions in 2011 other property plant and equipment expenditures included 231 million for sand mine and sand processing assets the 2010 exploration and development expenditures of 5386 million included 4366 million in development 926 million in exploration 76 million in capitalized interest and 18 million in property acquisitions in 2010 other property plant and equipment expenditures included 210 million for the acquisition of galveston lng inc the 2009 exploration and development expenditures of 3824 million included 2082 million in development 980 million in exploration 707 million in property acquisitions and 55 million in capitalized interest in 2009 other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 28 at december 31 2011 compared to 34 at december 31 2010 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

during 2011 total debt outstanding decreased 220 million to 5040 million the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 5657 million and 5602 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2011 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in a 315 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2011 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the public offering of eog common stock described below and proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2011 was 182 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were 3 million during the year 2011 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 2011 facility described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

on march 7 2011 eog completed the sale of 13570000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of 10550 per share net proceeds from the sale of the common stock were approximately 1388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes including funding capital expenditures 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2011 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2011 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom china and argentina the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2011 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2011 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc under those provisions as of december 31 2011 eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of 52 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 

outlook 

pricing crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2012 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2012 crude oil derivative contracts and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2012 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 31 million for net income and 46 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2012 natural gas derivative contracts based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2012 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 11 million for net income and 16 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts as of february 24 2012 see derivative transactions above 

  

  

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada in particular eog will be focused on united states and canada crude oil and liquidsrich drilling activity in its eagle ford bakken and three forks barnett combo wolfcamp and leonard shale plays and to a much lesser extent united states and canada natural gas drilling activity in the haynesville marcellus and british columbia horn river basin plays to hold acreage in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities 

the total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures of 74 to 76 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain noncore assets eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012 eogs business plan includes selling certain noncore assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall however eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under the 2011 facility and equity and debt offerings 

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2012 by 55 over 2011 levels total liquids production is expected to increase by 30 comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 30 and 30 respectively north american natural gas production is expected to decrease by 11 from 2011 levels 

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

  

  

oil and gas exploration costs 

 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2011 and 2010 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 15 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eogs calculation of depreciation depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account 

oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

depreciation and amortization of other property plant and equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

  

  

when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc in certain instances eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future during the past five years west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately 30 per barrel bbl to 145 per bbl and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately 183 per million british thermal units mmbtu to 13 per mmbtu eogs proved reserves estimates including the timing of future production are also subject to significant judgment and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available in the future if actual crude oil andor natural gas prices andor actual production diverge negatively from eogs current estimates impairment charges may be necessary 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs common stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

general 

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets crude oil and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states or us canada the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the united kingdom uk the peoples republic of china china and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is httpwwweogresourcescom 

at december 31 2010 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 1950 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of which 386 million barrels mmbbl were crude oil and condensate reserves 152 mmbbl were natural gas liquids reserves and 8470 billion cubic feet bcf or 1412 mmboe were natural gas reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 82 of eogs reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were located in the united states 11 in canada and 7 in trinidad as of december 31 2010 eog employed approximately 2290 persons including foreign national employees 

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis eog focuses on the costeffective utilization of advances in technology associated with the gathering processing and interpretation of threedimensional seismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives horizontal drilling formation logging techniques and reservoir stimulationcompletion methods these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves eog also makes select strategic acquisitions that result in additional economies of scale or land positions which provide significant additional prospects maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

business segments 

eogs operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related 

exploration and production 

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada with a current focus on liquidsrich plays 

at december 31 2010 30 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a crude oil equivalent basis were crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 70 were natural gas reserves substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of the applicable technologies described above eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2010 and certain 2011 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

  

  

united states in april 2010 eog announced its acreage holdings in the eagle ford play and in may 2010 eog opened an office in san antonio texas to focus on more fully exploiting its 595000 net acres in the eagle ford play the eagle ford has distinguished itself among other resource plays in the united states as it has crude oil wet gas and dry gas trends the economics of the crude oil and wet gas trends make this play one of the most impactful resource plays in the united states under current economic conditions eog holds 520000 net acres in the crude oil trend and 26000 net acres in the wet gas trend eog significantly increased its activity in this play during 2010 drilling 96 net wells and completing 80 net wells with 12 rigs running at yearend at yearend the net daily production was approximately 173 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 137 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas eog will focus its attention in 2011 on exploitation and development of the eagle ford play by drilling approximately 250 net wells and on the delineation of the full extent of our large oilrich acreage position 

in 2010 eog increased activity in the liquidsrich barnett shale combo play of the fort worth basin where production grew by approximately 230 above 2009 levels during the year eog completed 184 net barnett combo wells and increased its drilling potential in this liquidsrich play by expanding the core area from approximately 90000 net acres to 175000 net acres eog also completed 166 net barnett gas wells eogs total 2010 barnett shale average net daily production increased to approximately 232 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 404 mmcfd of natural gas for 2011 eog will continue to focus on growing liquids production from the barnett combo with plans to complete to sales an additional 262 net barnett combo wells eogs activity in the natural gas portion of the barnett will significantly decrease during 2011 with plans to complete approximately 24 net gas wells to sales with a large acreage position of approximately 600000 net acres in the fort worth basin barnett shale and a history of strong drilling results eog plans to continue significant drilling for years in the future 

throughout the rocky mountain area eog continued its focus on exploring and developing its crude oil properties during 2010 eog increased its development program in the williston basin by drilling 111 net wells in the bakken and three forks plays while increasing its acreage position to 600000 net acres available for exploration and development eog currently holds approximately 20 million net acres in the rocky mountain area exploration and development activities increased in the niobrara formation in both the dj colorado and wyoming and north park colorado basins with 31 net wells drilled in 2010 eog drilled 76 net wells on its uinta basin natural gas acreage a decrease from the prior year overall during 2010 eog drilled 222 net wells throughout the rocky mountain area total production increased 3 primarily through a 20 increase in liquids production the net average production for 2010 was 415 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 212 mmcfd of natural gas for 2011 eog intends to maintain its activity level in the bakken and three forks plays of the williston basin along with further exploration and development of its niobrara acreage position in the dj north park and powder river basins our primary focus remains on exploiting and expanding our crude oil resource positions and drilling activity will remain limited on our core natural gas assets within the rocky mountain area eog plans to drill approximately 159 net wells throughout the rocky mountain area during 2011 

in 2010 eog continued to expand its activities in the midcontinent area with continued growth and extension of the western anadarko basin and hugoton deep core areas for the year eog averaged net production of 58 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 60 mmcfd of natural gas total crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids volumes increased 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 in southwest kansas eog continued to focus on high potential targets in the morrow and st louis formations in a broad area which is part of the 900000 gross acres eog controls in the hugoton deep play in the western anadarko basin eog continued successful horizontal exploitation of the cleveland sandstone drilling 14 net wells with initial perwell production rates of approximately 350 barrels of oil per day bbld gross since 2002 eog has drilled over 220 net wells in this play and holds approximately 65000 acres throughout the trend in addition eog made new discoveries in both the marmaton sandstone and cherokee skinner formations a total of 16 net wells were drilled in 2010 in these formations with initial perwell production rates averaging 450 bbld gross these new liquidsrich plays will be exploited by drilling approximately 32 net wells in 2011 eog holds approximately 720000 net acres in the midcontinent area 

  

  

in 2010 eog drilled 34 net wells in the permian basin to test the leonardavalon shale bone spring wolfcamp and wolfberry formations eog is well positioned in three of these emerging plays the leonardavalon shale and bone spring plays in the delaware basin and the wolfcamp shale play in the midland basin production for the year 2010 averaged 78 mbbld net of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 62 mmcfd net of natural gas eog now holds approximately 540000 net acres throughout the permian basin with approximately 120000 acres within the wolfcamp shale formation and 120000 acres within the limits of the bone spring and leonardavalon formations in 2011 eog plans to continue the development expansion and enhancement of the wolfcamp leonardavalon and bone spring plays while continuing to acquire strategic acreage positions to test new play concepts approximately 52 net permian basin wells are planned during 2011 

 

in the south texas area eog drilled 48 net wells in 2010 net production during 2010 averaged 68 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 171 mmcfd of natural gas eogs activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio nueces brooks and kenedy counties eog continued exploitation of the lobo and roleta sands adding net reserves of 09 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids and 254 bcf of natural gas eog continued developing reserves at indian point and east white point under the nueces bay eog also exploited the liquidsrich frio and vicksburg trends in brooks and kenedy counties drilling 14 net wells in this 310000 gross acre area which includes surrounding counties eog holds approximately 550000 net acres in south texas approximately 61 net wells are planned during 2011 for south texas 

in the upper gulf coast region eog drilled 63 net wells and averaged 206 mmcfd of natural gas and 26 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in 2010 the haynesville and bossier shale plays located near the texaslouisiana border were major growth drivers for eog the program has grown from drilling 13 net wells in 2009 to 53 net wells in 2010 eog established a new texas sweet spot in 2010 with exceptional well results including numerous wells where initial production rates exceeded 20 mmcfd of natural gas eog now controls 183000 net acres in this play and most of this acreage is within a welldefined production sweet spot eog holds approximately 390000 net acres in the upper gulf coast region approximately 45 net wells are planned during 2011 for the upper gulf coast region 

during 2010 eog continued the development of its pennsylvania marcellus shale acreage drilling a total of 33 net wells including 18 net wells in bradford county in northeast pennsylvania which will be completed in 2011 the remaining 15 net wells were drilled in north central pennsylvania as part of eogs joint venture with seneca resources corporation eog holds a 50 working interest and is operator of this joint venture most of these joint venture wells have been completed and are producing several wells were turned to sales at rates in excess of 8 mmcfd a substantial improvement from previous years this rate increase is attributable to new completion procedures that were implemented in 2010 during 2010 eogs production from the marcellus shale averaged 12 mmcfd net in 2011 eog will continue to develop the marcellus shale by drilling an estimated 30 net wells those wells will be split between the joint venture area and bradford county eog currently holds in excess of 200000 net acres in the pennsylvania marcellus shale 

at december 31 2010 eog held approximately 44 million net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2010 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the barnett shale play of north texas and the bakken and three forks plays of north dakota in the barnett combo play eog expanded its natural gas processing plant capacity from 40 mmcfd to 80 mmcfd eog also continued its expansion of its barnett shale gathering system to transport production to its processing plant 

in the north dakota bakken play eog continued the expansion of its gathering system in the bakken core area and committed to a thirdparty gatherer for the installation of a gathering system for its bakken lite area the bakken lite system is expected to become operational in mid2011 during february 2010 eog placed in service a 76mile 12inch diameter dense phase natural gas gathering pipeline connecting its stanley north dakota condensate recovery plant and gathering system with the alliance pipeline near upham north dakota the alliance pipeline transports natural gas to the chicago illinois area 

at yearend 2010 the combined throughput of these gathering systems was approximately 80 mmcfd of natural gas eog expects to continue expanding its gathering and processing facilities to accommodate the drilling activity in the barnett shale and bakken plays the north texas systems total over 80 miles of 8inch 10inch and 20inch diameter pipe while the north dakota system totals over 320 miles of 8inch and 12inch pipe 

  

  

additionally in support of its operations in the williston basin eog continued to increase usage of its crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota transporting both its production and thirdparty production using this facility eog loaded 148 unit trains with crude oil for transport to stroud oklahoma during 2010 each unit train typically consists of 100 cars and has a total aggregate capacity of approximately 68000 barrels of crude oil in stroud oklahoma eog owns a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub these facilities are now fully operational with a capacity to transport approximately 70 mbbld of crude oil as a part of these facilities eog also owns and operates approximately 24 miles of 8inch and 12inch crude oil pipeline 

canada eog conducts operations through its whollyowned subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from its offices in calgary alberta during 2010 eogrc continued its focus on horizontal crude oil growth mainly through its drilling activity in waskada manitoba and highvale alberta and on bigger target horizontal natural gas in the horn river basin of british columbia during 2010 eogrc drilled or participated in 114 net wells 108 of which were horizontal wells and six of which were vertical wells correspondingly net crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by 47 to 76 mbbld and net natural gas production decreased 11 to 200 mmcfd the natural gas production volume decline also reflects the sales of several shallow gas properties consummated in the fourth quarter of 2010 eog received proceeds of approximately 344 million from these sales transactions the focus on crude oil production growth will continue in 2011 with 85 net wells planned in a combination of plays from the continued development in manitoba and new targets in alberta eog plans to drill four wells in the horn river basin in 2011 

during the second quarter of 2010 eogrc agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of galveston lng inc a calgarybased corporation which through its whollyowned subsidiary kitimat lng inc and affiliates owns 49 percent of the planned liquefied natural gas lng export terminal to be located at bish cove near the port of kitimat about 405 miles north of vancouver british columbia planned capacity of the proposed kitimat lng terminal is about 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day or five million metric tons of lng per year preliminary total construction costs currently estimated to be approximately 3 billion canadian will be revised at the conclusion of frontend engineering and design in addition galveston lng inc also owns a 245 percent interest in the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp a total estimated 1 billion canadian 300mile project originating at summit lake british columbia the pipeline is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the kitimat lng terminal an affiliate of apache corporation owns 51 percent of the planned kitimat lng terminal and a 255 percent interest in ptp and will be the operator of the kitimat lng terminal during the fourth quarter of 2010 upon the achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones eogrc paid 210 million to complete the acquisition of galveston lng inc in connection with the acquisition eog recorded intangible assets related to certain leases permits and other contracts during the first quarter of 2011 eogrc entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 245 percent interest in ptp for 245 million subject to customary closing conditions a portion of the purchase price 147 million will be paid at closing with the remaining amount 98 million to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the kitimat lng terminal subsequent to closing eogrcs ownership interest will be 49 percent an affiliate of apache corporation entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 255 percent interest in ptp which will increase its ownership interest to 51 percent of the proposed project 

at december 31 2010 eogrc held approximately 13 million net undeveloped acres in canada 

operations outside the united states and canada

several fields in the secc block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing in the pelican field eog drilled a successful exploratory well that began producing in the first quarter of 2010 in block 4a eog completed installation of offshore facilities and began its development drilling program in december 2010 to supply natural gas under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc into the north eastern offshore neo pipeline being installed by ngc eog is sourcing the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the neo pipeline is completed sales under the contract commenced on january 1 2010 

given eogs current level of equity ownership in cncl and n2000 and its ability to exercise significant influence over certain material actions it accounts for these investments using the equity method during 2010 eog recognized equity income of 5 million and received cash dividends of 6 million from cncl and recognized equity income of 8 million and received cash dividends of 10 million from n2000 

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to ngc or its subsidiary certain agreements with ngc require eogs trinidad operations to deliver approximately 500 mmcfd 345 mmcfd net of natural gas under current economic conditions for at least the next three years eog intends to fulfill these natural gas delivery obligations by using production from existing reserves crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago 

in 2010 eogs average net production from trinidad was 341 mmcfd of natural gas and 47 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

at december 31 2010 eog held approximately 39000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk owns a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916f located in the southern gas basin of the north sea during 2010 production continued in the valkyrie field in the southern gas basin 

eoguk also owns a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea the last well in the arthur field ceased production in 2010 

in 2006 eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating interest in this block a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan by the end of 2011 the operator and partners are currently negotiating processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners 

in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea blocks well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans during 2010 feasibility and frontend engineering design studies were completed and all principal contracts are currently being negotiated for the development plan a field development plan for the conwy field was submitted to the decc in the first quarter of 2011 and a separate plan is expected to be submitted for the corfe field before the end of the first quarter of 2011 regulatory approval of both plans is expected by the end of 2011 installation of pipelines drilling of development wells and initial production are planned for 2012 two additional exploratory wells offsetting the conwy field were drilled in the first quarter of 2010 both wells were unsuccessful the licenses for the east irish sea blocks were awarded to eoguk in 2007 

in 2010 production averaged 4 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom 

at december 31 2010 eog held approximately 190000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

  

  

china in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired 

during 2010 eog drilled four horizontal wells one of which was completed in 2010 and another which was completed in january 2011 in addition eog completed a horizontal well that was originally drilled in 2009 the wells completed in 2010 began production in the first and second quarters of 2010 eog plans to complete two wells during the second quarter of 2011 eog expects to complete its evaluation of the economic viability of this project during the first half of 2011 

in 2010 production averaged 10 mmcfd of natural gas net in china 

at december 31 2010 eog held approximately 130000 net acres in china 

other international eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

marketing 

wellhead marketing substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids are sold under various terms and arrangements based on prevailing market prices 

in 2010 eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts based on prevailing market prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximated the prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market in 2011 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same 

in 2010 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad are expected to remain the same in 2011 

in 2010 all wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the 2011 marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom is expected to remain the same 

in 2010 all of the wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2011 

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty natural gas production in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas 

during 2010 no single purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

competition 

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas moreover many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries and alternative energy sources 

regulation 

united states regulation of crude oil and natural gas production crude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by federal and state agencies 

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds regulate environmental and safety matters and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement boemre formerly the minerals management service both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the boemre 

blm and boemre leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the boemre such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior boemre approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the boemre may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests 

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices 

  

  

eog owns certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 

eogs gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and the federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely 

canadian regulation of crude oil and natural gas production  the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and gas industry with respect to taxes and factors affecting prices transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities or increase eogs costs and therefore may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties royalties payable on lands that the government has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations these laws and regulations could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control and under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and may in the future as discussed further below be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing 

  

  

compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations or competitive position it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

climate change  eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions eog is also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers to reduce ghg emissions and a recent us epa rulemaking that may result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the federal clean air act eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice 

eog has developed a system that is utilized in calculating ghg emissions from its operating facilities this emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies where applicable and on commonly accepted engineering practices eog is now reporting ghg emissions for facilities covered under the us epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule published on october 30 2009 eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

hydraulic fracturing  there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level hydraulic fracturing technology which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced enables eog to produce crude oil and natural gas that would otherwise not be recovered specifically hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface the makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99 water and sand and less than 1 highly diluted chemical additives lists of the chemical additives most typically used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of fracturing fluids while the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either recycled or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities eog regularly conducts audits of these disposal facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers 

currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in addition to these federal proposals some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

  

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the oil and gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or may result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under canadian laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations or competitive position it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

as noted above eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues canada is a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the kyoto protocol the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to work with the united states to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors with a stated goal to reduce canadas total ghg emissions by 17 from 2005 levels by 2020 in addition regulation of ghg emissions in canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level for example the alberta government regulates ghg emissions under the climate change and emissions management act the specified gas reporting regulation which imposes ghg emissions reporting requirements and the specified gas emitters regulation which imposes ghg emissions limits british columbia regulates ghg emissions under the greenhouse gas reduction targets act the greenhouse gas reduction cap and trade act which imposes hard caps on ghg emissions and the reporting regulation which requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions in addition the government of manitoba recently committed to moving forward with legislation enabling the creation of a cap and trade system to reduce ghg emissions in manitoba 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom and china 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change and hydraulic fracturing in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

  

  

other matters 

energy prices eog is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in prices for crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2010 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2011 average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states and canada increased by 37 in 2010 decreased by 38 in 2009 and increased by 28 in 2008 each as compared to the immediately preceding year the average new york mercantile exchange nymex crude oil strip price for 2011 has increased approximately 3 subsequent to december 31 2010 average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in a 13 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price received by eog for production in the united states and canada in 2010 a decrease of 54 in 2009 and an increase of 30 in 2008 each as compared to the immediately preceding year the average nymex natural gas strip price for 2011 has decreased by approximately 9 since december 31 2010 due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors 

including the impact of eogs 2011 crude oil hedges and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2011 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 26 million for net income and 38 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2011 natural gas hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2011 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 19 million for net income and 28 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas hedge positions as of december 31 2010 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily collar price swap and basis swap contracts as a means to manage this price risk see note 11 to consolidated financial statements in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the accounting standards codification these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at february 24 2011 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts at december 31 2010 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

 

all of eogs crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of crude oil and natural gas including blowouts rig and well explosions cratering fires and loss of well control each of which could result in damage to life property andor the environment eogs onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions moreover eogs activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

 

 

 

  

  

 

insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable specifically eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eogs onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions moreover in the event an incident with respect to eogs onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by thirdparty insurers for obligations expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident including obligations expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution cleanup and containment evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions in the specific event of a well blowout or outofcontrol well resulting in negative environmental effects such operators extra expense coverage would be eogs primary coverage with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog with regard to offshore operations all of eogs offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other thirdparty service contractors the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contractbycontract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 

 

in addition to the abovedescribed risks eogs operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks including increases in taxes and governmental royalties changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreignbased companies expropriation of assets unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations please refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject 

texas severance tax rate reduction natural gas production from qualifying texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production however the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a wellbywell basis for a discussion of the impact on eog see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  operating and other expenses

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes unless the context requires otherwise we us and our refer to eog resources inc and its subsidiaries 

a substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices would have a material and adverse effect on us 

prices for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate widely among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil andor natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

  

  

in addition if we expect significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering processing compression and transportation services 

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves which could in turn impact our future cash flow and results of operations 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future 

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

specifically as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions we are also aware of legislation proposed by us lawmakers and by the canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce ghg emissions 

additionally there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level currently the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process and in additional operating restrictions in addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells testing of nearby water wells restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and moreover could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing for additional discussion regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing see environmental regulation – united states and environmental regulation – canada under item 1 business – regulation 

we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws regulations or treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including as a result of accidents weather conditions loss of gathering processing compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted our cash flow and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements moreover there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all the weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings moreover a reduction in our cash flow for example as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 

we have various customers for the crude oil natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak in addition there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil natural gas or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies governmentaffiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market crude oil and natural gas in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition to a lesser extent from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the us from other countries and alternative energy sources 

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated moreover the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

  

  

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock for related discussion see item 2 properties – oil and gas exploration and production – properties and reserves 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 

demand for crude oil and natural gas is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flow and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result relatively lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as winter storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk 

we use derivative instruments primarily financial collars price swaps and basis swaps to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks include among other risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities or unexpected levels of liability 

the exploration for and production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities result in injury or death and damage property and the environment moreover our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration exploitation development and production activities and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 approximately 8 of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves 

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as discussion of eogs proved undeveloped reserves the qualifications of the preparers of eogs reserve estimates eogs independent petroleum consultants and eogs processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

in general the rate of production from eogs crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 

acreage the following table summarizes eogs developed and undeveloped acreage at december 31 2010 excluded is acreage in which eogs interest is limited to owned royalty overriding royalty and other similar interests 

 

most of our oil and gas leases particularly in the united states are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period generally not exceeding three years companywide approximately 1045713 net acres will expire in 2011 1407179 net acres will expire in 2012 and 1092688 net acres will expire in 2013 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions in the ordinary course of business based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis allowing eog to deliver longterm production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop lowcost reserves maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy 

net income available to common stockholders for 2010 totaled 161 million as compared to 547 million for 2009 at december 31 2010 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 1950 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe an increase of 154 mmboe from december 31 2009 

operations 

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2010 

united states and canada eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and natural gas production eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling expertise gained in natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil reservoirs in 2010 eog focused its efforts on developing its existing north american crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids acreage and capturing additional north american horizontal crude oil plays during 2010 the north dakota bakken and fort worth basin barnett shale areas produced an increased amount of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 2009 eog holds approximately 520000 net acres in the mature oil window of the eagle ford shale play near san antonio texas where it drilled 96 net wells and completed 80 net wells in 2010 eog averaged 151 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in this play in december 2010 and expects crude oil production from this play to continue to grow in 2011 in canada eog departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal natural gas growth in the horn river basin and horizontal crude oil growth within existing legacy fields mainly in waskada manitoba and highvale alberta in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately 83 of total company production in 2010 as compared to 86 in 2009 for 2010 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 27 of total company production as compared to 22 for 2009 based on current trends eog expects its 2011 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2010 eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada 

during the second quarter of 2010 eogs whollyowned canadian subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of galveston lng inc a calgarybased corporation which through its whollyowned subsidiary kitimat lng inc and affiliates owns 49 percent of the planned liquefied natural gas lng export terminal to be located at bish cove near the port of kitimat about 405 miles north of vancouver british columbia planned capacity of the proposed kitimat lng terminal is about 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day or five million metric tons of lng per year preliminary total construction costs currently estimated to be approximately 3 billion canadian will be revised at the conclusion of frontend engineering and design in addition galveston lng inc also owns a 245 percent interest in the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp a total estimated 1 billion canadian 300mile project originating at summit lake british columbia the pipeline is intended to link western canadas natural gas producing regions to the kitimat lng terminal an affiliate of apache corporation owns 51 percent of the planned kitimat lng terminal and a 255 percent interest in ptp and will be the operator of the kitimat lng terminal during the fourth quarter of 2010 upon the achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones eogrc paid 210 million to complete the acquisition of galveston lng inc in connection with the acquisition eog recorded intangible assets related to 

  

  

certain leases permits and other contracts such intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets during the first quarter of 2011 eogrc entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 245 percent interest in ptp for 245 million subject to customary closing conditions a portion of the purchase price 147 million will be paid at closing with the remaining amount 98 million to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the kitimat lng terminal subsequent to closing eogrcs ownership interest will be 49 percent an affiliate of apache corporation entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 255 percent interest in ptp which will increase its ownership interest to 51 percent of the proposed project 

as previously reported eog began marketing its canadian shallow natural gas assets in july 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2010 eog closed on transactions with three separate parties to sell these assets for approximately 344 million including an estimate of customary adjustments under each respective sales agreement eog recorded a pretax impairment of 280 million to adjust the shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell these assets represented approximately 4 of eogs total 2009 production and approximately 3 of eogs total yearend 2009 proved reserves in addition eog received proceeds of approximately 329 million from the sale in 2010 of noncore producing properties and acreage primarily in the rocky mountain area texas and pennsylvania 

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts several fields in the south east coast consortium secc block modified ua block and modified ub block as well as the pelican field have been developed and are producing in the pelican field eog drilled a successful exploratory well that began producing in the first quarter of 2010 in block 4a eog completed installation of offshore facilities and began its development drilling program in december 2010 to supply natural gas under a contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc into the north eastern offshore neo pipeline being installed by ngc eog is sourcing the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the neo pipeline is completed sales under the contract commenced on january 1 2010 

in the united kingdom uk eog has ongoing production from the valkyrie field in the southern gas basin of the north sea block 4916f the last well in the arthur field ceased production in 2010 

in 2006 eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f eog has a 25 nonoperating interest in this block a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan by the end of 2011 the operator and partners are currently negotiating processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners 

in 2009 eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea blocks well 110126 in which eoguk has a 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field in 2010 eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block designated corfe to its overall development plans during 2010 feasibility and frontend engineering design studies were completed and all principal contracts are currently being negotiated for the development plan a field development plan for the conwy field was submitted to the decc in the first quarter of 2011 and a separate plan is expected to be submitted for the corfe field before the end of the first quarter of 2011 regulatory approval of both plans is expected by the end of 2011 installation of pipelines drilling of development wells and initial production are planned for 2012 two additional exploratory wells offsetting the conwy field were drilled in the first quarter of 2010 both wells were unsuccessful the licenses for the east irish sea blocks were awarded to eoguk in 2007 

in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired during 2010 eog drilled four horizontal wells one of which was completed in 2010 and another which was completed in january 2011 in addition eog completed a horizontal well that was originally drilled in 2009 the wells completed in 2010 began production in the first and second quarters of 2010 eog plans to complete two wells during the second quarter of 2011 eog expects to complete its evaluation of the economic viability of this project during the first half of 2011 

eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 

  

  

capital structure 

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 34 and 22 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

during 2010 eog funded 60 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement costs and noncash acquisition costs paid 153 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 11 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities proceeds from longterm debt borrowings described below and proceeds of 673 million from the sale of certain north american assets 

on november 23 2010 eog completed its public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 2500 senior notes due 2016 2016 notes 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4100 senior notes due 2021 2021 notes together the fixed rate notes and 350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2014 the floating rate notes interest on the fixed rate notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning on february 1 2011 interest on the floating rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears on february 3 may 3 august 3 and november 3 of each year beginning on february 3 2011 and is based on the threemonth london interbank offering rate libor plus 075 per annum the interest rate on the floating rate notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates net proceeds from the offering of approximately 1487 million were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings contemporaneously with the offering of the floating rate notes eog entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the floating rate notes at 187 

on september 10 2010 eog entered into a second 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders 2010 agreement the 2010 agreement matures on september 10 2013 subject to eogs option to extend on up to two occasions the term for successive oneyear periods see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

on may 20 2010 eog completed its public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 295 senior notes due 2015 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 440 senior notes due 2020 together notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2010 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 990 million were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

the total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures are 64 to 66 billion excluding acquisitions the majority of 2011 expenditures will be focused on united states and canada crude oil drilling activity and to a lesser extent natural gas drilling activity in the haynesville marcellus and british columbia horn river basin plays to hold acreage eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2011 eogs business plan includes selling certain noncore natural gas assets in 2011 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall however eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings 

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

  

  

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues 

during 2010 net operating revenues increased 1313 million or 27 to 6100 million from 4787 million in 2009 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2010 increased 1482 million or 44 to 4881 million from 3399 million in 2009 during 2010 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million compared to net gains of 432 million in 2009 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas in 2010 increased 503 million or 123 to 910 million from 407 million in 2009 gains on property dispositions net of 224 million in 2010 primarily consist of gains on property dispositions in the rocky mountain area gains on property dispositions net in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of 390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the rocky mountain area and a pretax gain of 146 million realized on the sale of eogs california assets 

  

  

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

1 thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day as applicable 

 

 

 

  

  

2010 compared to 2009 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2010 increased 909 million or 83 to 1999 million from 1090 million in 2009 due to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 533 million and an increase of 20 mbbld or 35 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 376 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in texas 8 mbbld north dakota 7 mbbld canada 3 mbbld and trinidad 2 mbbld production increases in texas were the result of increased production from the fort worth basin barnett combo and the eagle ford plays production increases in north dakota resulted from increased deliveries from the bakken and three forks plays eogs composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2010 increased 36 to 7429 per barrel compared to 5446 per barrel in 2009 

natural gas liquids revenues in 2010 increased 203 million or 79 to 462 million from 259 million in 2009 due to a higher composite average price 129 million and an increase of 7 mbbld or 29 in natural gas liquids deliveries 74 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale area eogs composite average natural gas liquids price in 2010 increased 39 to 4173 per barrel compared to 3005 per barrel in 2009 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2010 increased 369 million or 18 to 2420 million from 2051 million in 2009 the increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 316 million and increased natural gas deliveries 53 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 15 to 393 per thousand cubic feet mcf in 2010 from 342 per mcf in 2009 

natural gas deliveries in 2010 increased 43 million cubic feet per day mmcfd or 3 to 1688 mmcfd from 1645 mmcfd in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher production in trinidad 68 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production in canada 24 mmcfd and the united states 1 mmcfd the increase in trinidad was primarily attributable to deliveries under a takeorpay contract which began january 1 2010 the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to decreased production in the rocky mountain area 28 mmcfd offshore gulf of mexico 9 mmcfd new mexico 6 mmcfd texas 5 mmcfd kansas 5 mmcfd and mississippi 4 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in louisiana 45 mmcfd and pennsylvania 11 mmcfd 

during 2010 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net realized gains of 7 million during 2009 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 432 million which included net realized gains of 1278 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues represent sales of thirdparty crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 gathering processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas for the year ended december 31 2008 gathering processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty natural gas the purchase and sale of thirdparty crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eogowned facilities marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs 

during 2010 gathering processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2010 totaled 25 million compared to 10 million in 2009 primarily as a result of higher crude oil marketing margins 

2009 compared to 2008 wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased 368 million or 25 to 1090 million in 2009 from 1458 million in 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 675 million partially offset by an increase of 10 mbbld or 21 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 307 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota 8 mbbld and texas 2 mbbld the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38 to 5446 per barrel compared to 8818 per barrel for 2008 

  

  

natural gas liquids revenues decreased 53 million or 17 to 259 million in 2009 from 312 million in 2008 due to a lower composite average price 201 million partially offset by an increase of 8 mbbld or 48 in natural gas liquids deliveries 148 million the composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44 to 3005 per barrel compared to 5342 per barrel for 2008 the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 

wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased 2401 million or 54 to 2051 million from 4452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 2460 million partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries 59 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54 to 342 per mcf in 2009 from 751 per mcf in 2008 

natural gas deliveries increased 26 mmcfd or 2 to 1645 mmcfd in 2009 from 1619 mmcfd in 2008 the increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 mmcfd in trinidad partially offset by lower production of 28 mmcfd in the united states and 6 mmcfd in the united kingdom the increase in trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 39 mmcfd and increased net contractual deliveries 16 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to decreased production from texas 26 mmcfd new mexico 6 mmcfd mississippi 4 mmcfd kansas 3 mmcfd and oklahoma 3 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in louisiana 6 mmcfd and in the rocky mountain area 8 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

during 2009 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 432 million which included net realized gains of 1278 million during 2008 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 598 million which included net realized losses of 137 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased 2 million to 10 million in 2009 compared to 12 million in 2008 the decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the gulf coast area 

operating and other expenses 

2010 compared to 2009  during 2010 operating expenses of 5577 million were 1761 million higher than the 3816 million incurred in 2009   the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below 

  

  

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time in general operating costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating costs for wells producing natural gas 

lease and well expenses of 698 million in 2010 increased 119 million from 579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 67 million and canada 6 million increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 27 million primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 14 million and increased workover expenditures in the united states 3 million and canada 2 million 

transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs transportation fees and costs associated with eogs crudebyrail operations 

transportation costs of 385 million in 2010 increased 102 million from 283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 46 million the upper gulf coast area 29 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 29 million these increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets the increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area also include costs associated with eogs crudebyrail operations which began transporting crude oil from stanley north dakota to cushing oklahoma at the end of december 2009 

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets compressors crudebyrail assets vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software 

dda expenses in 2010 increased 393 million to 1942 million from 1549 million in 2009 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were 378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 97 million trinidad 12 million and china 2 million partially offset by a decrease in production in canada 8 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 167 million canada 86 million trinidad 12 million and china 8 million and unfavorable changes in the canadian exchange rate 28 million partially offset by a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 24 million 

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the rocky mountain area 10 million and the fort worth basin barnett shale area 4 million 

ga expenses of 280 million in 2010 were 32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 10 million higher legal and other professional fees 7 million and higher information systems costs 3 million 

  

  

net interest expense of 130 million in 2010 increased 29 million from 101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 50 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 21 million 

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets 

gathering and processing costs increased 9 million to 67 million in 2010 compared to 58 million in 2009 the increase reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 6 million and the rocky mountain area 3 million 

exploration costs of 187 million in 2010 increased 17 million from 170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employeerelated costs in the united states 

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is generally calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate for certain natural gas assets held for sale eog utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 

impairments of 743 million in 2010 increased 437 million from 306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment in canada eog recorded impairments of proved properties and other property plant and equipment of 526 million and 94 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2010 eog recorded a pretax impairment of 280 million to adjust certain canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell see note 17 to consolidated financial statements additionally eog recorded pretax impairments of 170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain north american onshore and offshore natural gas assets 

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2010 increased 143 million to 317 million 65 of wellhead revenues from 174 million 51 of wellhead revenues in 2009 the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the united states 56 million trinidad 22 million and canada 6 million a decrease in credits available to eog in 2010 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit 43 million and higher ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 14 million 

other income net was 14 million in 2010 compared to 2 million in 2009 the increase of 12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 9 million 

income tax provision of 247 million in 2010 decreased 78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61 from 37 in 2009 the increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate is primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in trinidad and canadian book losses which resulted largely from the impairment of certain canadian shallow natural gas impairments the statutory tax rates in the united states and trinidad are higher than the canadian statutory rate 

  

  

2009 compared to 2008  during 2009 operating expenses of 3816 million were 456 million higher than the 3360 million incurred in 2008   the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below 

lease and well expenses of 579 million in 2009 increased 20 million from 559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in canada 16 million and the united states 14 million partially offset by changes in the canadian exchange rate 8 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses 5 million 

transportation costs of 283 million in 2009 increased 9 million from 274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 19 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 8 million 

dda expenses in 2009 increased 222 million to 1549 million from 1327 million in 2008 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties were 192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 42 million canada 9 million and trinidad 6 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 3 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 105 million canada 22 million and trinidad 13 million partially offset by changes in the canadian exchange rate 13 million 

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 16 million and the rocky mountain area 9 million 

ga expenses of 248 million in 2009 were 5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs 3 million and higher employeerelated costs 2 million 

net interest expense of 101 million in 2009 increased 49 million from 52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 61 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 12 million 

gathering and processing costs increased 17 million to 58 million in 2009 compared to 41 million in 2008 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 8 million and the rocky mountain area 8 million 

exploration costs of 170 million in 2009 decreased 24 million from 194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 

  

  

impairments of 306 million in 2009 increased 113 million from 193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 103 million and increased impairments of proved properties in the united states 32 million partially offset by 2008 impairments in trinidad as a result of eogs relinquishment of its rights to block lower reverse l lrl 20 million and in the uk for the arthur field 6 million eog recorded impairments of proved properties of 94 million and 86 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

taxes other than income in 2009 decreased 147 million to 174 million 51 of wellhead revenues from 321 million 52 of wellhead revenues in 2008 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the united states 103 million trinidad 13 million and canada 3 million an increase in credits taken in 2009 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 16 million and lower ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 15 million 

other income net was 2 million in 2009 compared to 31 million in 2008 the decrease of 29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 15 million lower interest income 8 million and settlements received in 2008 related to a bankruptcy 3 million 

income tax provision of 325 million in 2009 decreased 984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37 from 35 in 2008 the increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of lrl

exploration and development expenditures of 5386 million for 2010 were 1562 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 1932 million canada 134 million trinidad 104 million and china 15 million unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in canada 58 million increased capitalized interest in the united states 21 million increased employeerelated exploration costs in the united states 11 million and increased dry hole costs in the united kingdom 11 million and canada 10 million these increases were partially offset by decreased property acquisition expenditures in the united states 689 million decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 20 million and decreased dry hole costs in the united states 9 million the 2010 exploration and development expenditures of 5386 million included 4366 million in development 926 million in exploration 76 million in capitalized interest and 18 million in property acquisitions the increase in expenditures for other property plant and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of galveston lng inc the 2009 exploration and development expenditures of 3824 million included 2082 million in development 980 million in exploration 707 million in property acquisitions and 55 million in capitalized interest the decrease in expenditures for other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale area the 2008 exploration and development expenditures of 4912 million included 3612 million in development 1148 million in exploration 109 million in property acquisitions and 43 million in capitalized interest the increase in expenditures for other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom and china such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 

derivative transactions 

during 2010 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 62 million which included net realized gains of 7 million during 2009 eog recognized net gains on the marktomarket of financial commodity derivative contracts of 432 million which included net realized gains of 1278 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

  

  

financial price swap contracts the total fair value of eogs crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 as an asset of 69 million and a liability of 21 million respectively presented below is a comprehensive summary of eogs crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts at february 24 2011 with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day bbld and in million british thermal units per day mmbtud and prices expressed in dollars per barrel bbl and in dollars per million british thermal units mmbtu as applicable

financing 

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 34 at december 31 2010 compared to 22 at december 31 2009 as used in this calculation total capitalization represents the sum of total current and longterm debt and total stockholders equity 

during 2010 total debt increased 2463 million to 5260 million the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 5602 million and 3056 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2010 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in a 330 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2010 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the issuance of the fixed rate notes floating rate notes and notes described below proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 20 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2010 was 1039 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2010 was 14 million with no amounts outstanding at yearend the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were 191 million and 01 million respectively during the year 2010 eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the two 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreements with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

on november 23 2010 eog completed its public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 2500 senior notes due 2016 2016 notes 750 million aggregate principal amount of 4100 senior notes due 2021 2021 notes together the fixed rate notes and 350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2014 the floating rate notes interest on the fixed rate notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning on february 1 2011 interest on the floating rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears on february 3 may 3 august 3 and november 3 of each year beginning on february 3 2011 and is based on the threemonth libor plus 075 per annum the interest rate on the floating rate notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates net proceeds from the offering of approximately 1487 million were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings contemporaneously with the offering of the floating rate notes eog entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the floating rate notes at 187 

on may 20 2010 eog completed its public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 295 senior notes due 2015 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 440 senior notes due 2020 together notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2010 net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately 990 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

on may 21 2009 eog completed its public offering of 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 2019 notes interest on the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2009 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 891 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

  

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2010 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

during 2010 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the uk and china the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2010 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2010 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

  

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification asc under those provisions as of december 31 2010 eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of 55 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of 3 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 

outlook 

pricing crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids natural gas ammonia and methanol prices in the future the market price of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2011 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact eogs financial position 

including the impact of eogs 2011 crude oil hedges and based on eogs tax position eogs price sensitivity in 2011 for each 100 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 26 million for net income and 38 million for cash flows from operating activities including the impact of eogs 2011 natural gas hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2011 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 19 million for net income and 28 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs crude oil and natural gas hedge position as of december 31 2010 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada in particular eog will be focused on united states and canada crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford bakken and three forks and barnett combo plays and to a lesser extent natural gas drilling activity in the haynesville marcellus and british columbia horn river basin plays in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities 

the total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures of 64 to 66 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain noncore natural gas assets however eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities bank borrowings borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings 

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2011 by 95 over 2010 levels total liquids production is expected to increase by 49 comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 55 and 34 respectively north american natural gas production is expected to decrease by 5 from 2010 levels 

  

  

summary of critical accounting policies 

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies 

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time for related discussion see item 1a risk factors 

oil and gas exploration costs 

 

eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2010 and 2009 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 16 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas are capitalized 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties 

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets including natural gas gathering and processing facilities are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

  

  

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions property acquisitions andor property dispositions and impairments 

impairments 

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred 

when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

general

eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries collectively eog explores for develops produces and markets natural gas and crude oil primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states canada the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad the united kingdom the peoples republic of china china and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through eogs website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is httpwwweogresourcescom 

at december 31 2009 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 10776 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe of which 8898 billion cubic feet bcf were natural gas reserves and 220 million barrels mmbbl or 1317 bcfe were crude oil and condensate reserves and 93 mmbbl or 561 bcfe were natural gas liquids reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 75 of eogs reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were located in the united states 16 in canada and 9 in trinidad as of december 31 2009 eog employed approximately 2100 persons including foreign national employees

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis eog focuses on the costeffective utilization of advances in technology associated with the gathering processing and interpretation of threedimensional 3d seismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives horizontal drilling formation logging techniques and reservoir stimulationcompletion methods these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves eog also makes select strategic acquisitions that result in additional economies of scale or land positions which provide significant additional prospects maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

business segments 

eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil exploration and production related 

exploration and production 

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada 

at december 31 2009 81 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and 19 were crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of the applicable technologies described above eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2009 and certain 2010 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states in 2009 eog completed 116 net gas wells in the barnett shale play of the fort worth basin eog uses the term combo wells to refer to wells that derive economic value from crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids and associated natural gas in relatively equal portions during 2009 eog completed 94 net combo wells in the barnett shale play during the year eogs total production from the barnett shale play grew to an average net daily rate of 400 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas and 131 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eogs 2009 liquids production from the barnett shale play increased by approximately 97 compared to 2008 for 2010 eog plans to drill approximately 234 net barnett shale combo wells primary 2010 growth for eog in the barnett shale will be provided by crude oil and natural gas liquids during the third quarter of 2009 eog acquired certain crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets in the barnett shale consisting of proved developed and undeveloped reserves and approximately 33000 net unproved acres with a total of approximately 840000 net acres eog is one of the largest leaseholders in the barnett shale play providing eog with longterm reserve and production growth potential for years to come 

throughout the rocky mountain area eog expanded its acreage position with the addition of prospective crude oil acreage in 2009 eog now holds approximately 15 million net acres in the rocky mountain area including over 500000 net acres throughout the williston basin of north dakota and montana available for exploration in the bakken and three forks plays in addition eog also holds acreage in the rocky mountain area relating to certain potential exploration and development prospects which eog is currently evaluating during 2009 eog drilled 106 net wells in the uinta basin utah and 57 net wells in the williston basin production from the rocky mountain area increased 14 primarily through increased liquids production the net average production for 2009 was 240 mmcfd of natural gas and 347 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in december 2009 eog and a third party exchanged certain natural gas related properties in the rocky mountain area in 2010 eog intends to increase its activity level in the bakken and three forks plays in the williston basin by drilling over 95 net wells eog will have limited drilling activity on its core natural gas assets within the rocky mountain area and will primarily focus on exploiting and expanding the oil resource plays 

in 2009 eog continued to expand its activities in the midcontinent area with continued growth and extension of the western anadarko basin and hugoton deep core areas for the year eog averaged net production of 76 mmcfd of natural gas and 53 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids total crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids volumes increased 15 in 2009 compared to 2008 in southwest kansas eog continued its active drilling program focused on high potential morrow and st louis targets in a broad area which is part of the 900000 gross acres eog controls in the hugoton deep play in the western anadarko basin eog continued its successful horizontal exploitation of the cleveland sandstone drilling 13 net wells with per well initial production rates of approximately 500 barrels of oil per day since 2002 eog has drilled over 200 net wells in this play and holds approximately 65000 acres throughout the trend eog significantly expanded its acreage position in the western anadarko basin during 2009 with the addition of over 100000 net acres focused on the extension of core plays as well as multiple new liquidsrich plays which will be exploited in 2010 and beyond eog holds approximately 580000 net acres in the midcontinent area

in the south texas area eog experienced continued success in 2009 drilling 54 net wells during 2009 net production averaged 204 mmcfd of natural gas and 75 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eogs activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio duval and matagorda counties where eog drilled successful wells in the lobo roleta frio and wilcox trends eog continued to focus on horizontal drilling targeting the perdido wilcox and lobo sands eog also continued directional drilling under nueces bay eog drilled a deeper pool wildcat discovery under indian point along with additional development drilling with seven wells drilled yielding over 34 bcfe net proved reserves eog plans to significantly increase drilling activity in the south texas area in 2010 approximately 168 net wells are planned during 2010 for south texas eog holds approximately 600000 net acres in the south texas area in addition eog holds acreage in the south texas area relating to certain potential exploration and development prospects which eog is currently evaluating 

also during 2009 eog participated in 25 net wells and implemented five wolfcamp waterfloods in the permian basin area the wells drilled throughout the permian basin tested the bone spring wolfcamp permopenn and other objectives production for the year averaged approximately 69 mmcfd of natural gas and 71 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eog acquired approximately 230 square miles of 3d data and added 100000 net acres during 2009 eog holds approximately 490000 net acres throughout the permian basin area in 2010 eog plans to continue the development of existing permian basin plays acquire acreage positions in new plays and test new play concepts

 

in the upper gulf coast area eog averaged 144 mmcfd of natural gas and 28 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in 2009 eog drilled 31 net wells with 10 net wells being travis peak vertical stacked pays and cotton valley horizontal development wells located in east texas and north louisiana a major growth driver for eog in this area is the expanded haynesville and bossier shale program that has grown from drilling two wells in late 2008 to 13 wells in 2009 eog expects to drill 48 net haynesville and bossier shale wells in 2010 on the 159000 net acres held in the play mississippi development focused on a combined crude oil and natural gas discovery at mechanicsburg field where eog drilled eight wells in the fourth quarter of 2009 eog acquired 39500 net unproved acres in nacogdoches county texas within the haynesville and bossier shale formations and expects to acquire up to an additional 7500 net acres as part of the same transaction during the first quarter of 2010 eog holds approximately 370000 net acres in the upper gulf coast area

during 2009 eog continued the development of its pennsylvania marcellus shale acreage drilling a total of three gross vertical and 17 gross horizontal wells 13 net wells nine of the wells have been completed with most of those awaiting final construction of gas gathering system infrastructure to commence sales the gas gathering systems being constructed by eog should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 several wells tested at 24hour rates in excess of 5 mmcfd in 2010 eog will continue to develop the marcellus shale drilling an estimated 25 to 30 net wells most of the wells will be in the seneca joint venture area in clearfield elk and mckean counties pennsylvania where eog holds a 50 working interest several wells are also planned for bradford county pennsylvania where eog holds a 100 working interest eog currently holds approximately 225000 net acres in the pennsylvania marcellus shale 

at december 31 2009 eog held approximately 4185000 net undeveloped acres in the united states

during 2009 eog continued the expansion of its gathering and processing activities in the barnett shale play of north texas and the bakken play of north dakota in 2009 eog placed into operation one 40 mmcfd natural gas processing plant in the barnett combo play of north texas and began construction of a second 40 mmcfd processing unit which is expected to begin operation during the second quarter of 2010 eog also expanded its gathering system in the barnett combo play to transport production to its processing plant and continued expansion of its gathering system in the bakken play 

in the north dakota bakken play eog constructed and placed in service during february 2010 a 76mile 12inch diameter dense phase natural gas gathering pipeline connecting its stanley north dakota gathering system with the alliance pipeline near upham north dakota the alliance pipeline transports natural gas to the chicago illinois area eog also replaced its 20 mmcfd natural gas liquids processing plant located near stanley north dakota with an 80 mmcfd refrigeration oilcondensate removal plant in combination these projects will allow eog to more efficiently transport the associated natural gas and natural gas liquids production from its bakken oil wells at yearend 2009 the combined throughput of these systems was 15 mmcfd of natural gas

additionally in support of its operations in the bakken play eog constructed a crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota designed to load crude oil into 100car unit trains for transport to stroud oklahoma at stroud oklahoma eog constructed a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub the first shipment of crude oil through these facilities occurred at yearend 2009 when fully operational the capacity of these facilities is expected to allow transport of approximately 60000 barrels per day of bakken crude oil 

eog expects to continue expanding its gathering and processing facilities to accommodate the drilling activity in the barnett shale and bakken plays the north texas systems total over 70 miles of 8inch 10inch and 20inch diameter pipe while the north dakota system totals 290 miles of 8inch and 12inch pipe

canada eog conducts operations through its subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in calgary alberta during 2009 eogrc departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal gas growth in the horn river basin and horizontal crude oil growth within existing legacy fields mainly in waskada manitoba and highvale alberta during 2009 eogrc drilled or participated in 98 net wells 60 of which were horizontal wells and 38 of which were vertical wells correspondingly net crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by 41 to 52 mbbld and natural gas production increased 1 to 224 mmcfd due to this shift in focus the horizontal production growth strategy will continue in 2010 with 12 net horizontal gas wells planned in the horn river basin and 120 net horizontal oil wells planned in waskada and other projects eogrc acquired 530000 net acres during the economic downturn in 2009 which will set up numerous exploration and development opportunities in 2010 and beyond 

at december 31 2009 eogrc held approximately 1660000 net undeveloped acres in canada

operations outside the united states and canada

eog has operations in trinidad the united kingdom north sea and east irish sea and the china sichuan basin and is evaluating additional exploration development and exploitation opportunities in those and other international areas

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to ngc or its subsidiary crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations currently is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago

in 2009 eogs average net production from trinidad was 273 mmcfd of natural gas and 31 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

at december 31 2009 eog held approximately 156000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom in 2002 eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk acquired a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916 located in the southern gas basin of the north sea in august 2004 production commenced in the valkyrie field in the southern gas basin 

in 2003 eoguk acquired a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea since november 2003 three successful exploratory wells have been drilled in the arthur field with production commencing in january 2005 there is currently one remaining producing well in the arthur field and this well is expected to cease production during the first half of 2010

in 2006 eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the united kingdom uk department of energy and climate change during the second quarter of 2010 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in late 2010 the operator and partners are currently evaluating an export route for production from the project 

during the third quarter of 2009 eog completed a farmin agreement with owners of the central north sea block 1530a area ab in december 2009 eog as operator drilled an exploratory well on this prospect which was declared a dry hole in january 2010

during the second quarter of 2009 eoguk drilled two exploratory wells in the east irish sea well 11014b7 in which eoguk has a 70 working interest was a dry hole while well 110126 in which eoguk has 100 working interest was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field engineering studies were initiated with an intent to submit a field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change during the first quarter of 2010 a rig has been contracted and has begun drilling two further exploratory wells offsetting the conwy field the first of the wells was declared a dry hole in february 2010 results are expected for the second well by the end of the first quarter of 2010 the licenses for the east irish sea were awarded to eoguk in 2007 

in 2009 production averaged 7 mmcfd of natural gas net in the united kingdom

at december 31 2009 eog held approximately 277000 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

china in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired 

during the second quarter of 2009 eog completed a monitoring well and in the third quarter of 2009 drilled a horizontal well which will be completed and tested during the first quarter of 2010 during the third quarter of 2009 eog drilled a second monitoring well to evaluate one of the shallower zones and is currently drilling a second horizontal well that is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2010

in 2009 production averaged 8 million cubic feet equivalent per day of natural gas net in china

at december 31 2009 eog held approximately 130000 net acres in china

other international eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

marketing

wellhead marketing in 2009 eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production was sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts based on prevailing market prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximated the prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market in 2010 the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same

in 2009 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad is expected to remain the same in 2010 

in 2009 over 90 of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the 2010 marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is to sell all natural gas on the spot market 

in 2009 all of the wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2010

substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids are sold under various terms and arrangements based on prevailing market prices

in certain instances eog purchases and sells thirdparty natural gas production in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas 

during 2009 no single purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf crude oil and condensate per barrel bbl and natural gas liquids per bbl the table also presents natural gas equivalent volumes which are determined using the ratio of 60 mcf of natural gas to 10 bbl of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids for each of the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007

 1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 other international includes eogs united kingdom operations and effective july 1 2008 eogs china operations 3 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids 4 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable

competition

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market natural gas and crude oil moreover many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries and to a lesser extent alternative energy sources

regulation

united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by state and federal agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds regulate environmental and safety matters and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior mms approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the mms may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect eogs interests

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales conversely sales of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices

eog owns certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and the federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations these laws and regulations could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control and under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the united states environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 

compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations or competitive position it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions eog is also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers to reduce ghg emissions eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any such proposed laws regulations and treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

eog supports efforts to understand and address the contribution of human activities to global climate change through the application of sound scientific research and analysis moreover eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary

canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production  the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and gas industry with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities or increase eogs costs and therefore may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of natural gas and crude oil production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties royalties payable on lands that the government has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow

the alberta government implemented a new oil and gas royalty framework effective january 2009 the new framework establishes new royalties for conventional crude oil natural gas and bitumen that are linked to price and production levels and apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects under the new framework the formula for conventional oil and gas royalties uses a sliding rate formula dependant on the market price and production volumes royalty rates for conventional crude oil range from 0 to 50 and natural gas royalty rates range from 5 to 50 

the deep oil exploration program doep and the natural gas deep drilling program ngddp are new programs that began january 1 2009 in alberta these programs provide upfront royalty adjustments to new wells to qualify for royalty adjustments under the doep exploratory oil wells must have a vertical depth greater than 2000 meters with a government interest and must be spudded after january 1 2009 these oil wells qualify for a royalty exemption on either the first 1000000 canadian dollars of royalty or the first 12 months of production whichever comes first the ngddp applies to natural gas wells producing at a vertical depth greater than 2500 meters the ngddp will have an escalating royalty credit in line with progressively deeper wells from 625 canadian dollars per meter to a maximum of 3750 canadian dollars per meter there are additional benefits for the deepest wells both the doep and the ngddp are fiveyear programs any wells spudded after december 31 2013 or any wells for which eog chooses the transition option described below will not qualify under either program no royalty adjustments will be granted under either the doep or the ngddp after december 31 2018

in november 2008 the alberta government announced that companies drilling new natural gas and conventional crude oil wells at depths between 1000 and 3500 meters which are spudded between november 19 2008 and december 31 2013 will have a onetime option of selecting new transitional royalty rates or the new royalty framework rates the transition option provides lower royalties in the initial years of a wells life for example under the transition option royalty rates for natural gas wells will range from 5 to 30 the election is made prior to the end of the first calendar month in which the commodity is produced all wells using the transitional royalty rates must shift to the new royalty framework rates on january 1 2014 

eog expects these regulations of the alberta government to have a marginally positive impact on eogs financial condition and results of operations

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the oil and gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or may result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under canadian laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations or competitive position it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

as noted above eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues canada is a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the kyoto protocol the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors in the regulatory framework for air emissions released april 2007 and updated in a march 2008 document entitled turning the corner regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions collectively federal plan the federal plan outlines proposed policies to reduce the emissions of ghg and air pollutants by establishing mandatory emissions reduction requirements on a sector basis sectorspecific regulations could come into effect as early as 2010 and targets are expected to be based on percentages rather than absolute reductions eog is also aware of legislation proposed by the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions as well as proposed regulations that would establish a credit emissions trading system in canada additionally regulation of ghg emissions in canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level for example the alberta government regulates ghg emissions under the climate change and emissions management act the specified gas reporting regulation which imposes ghg emissions reporting requirements and the specified gas emitters regulation which imposes ghg emissions limits 

eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any such proposed laws regulations and treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such enacted laws regulations and treaties and if enacted proposed laws regulations and treaties could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material and adverse effect on us

prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely since we are primarily a natural gas company we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are

the level of consumer demand 

supplies of natural gas and crude oil 

weather conditions and changes in weather patterns 

domestic and international drilling activity 

the price and availability of and demand for competing energy sources including liquefied natural gas and alternative energy sources 

the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities 

worldwide economic and political conditions 

the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including trading by commodity price speculators and others 

the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and 

the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation including environmental regulations 

our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil prolonged or substantial declines in natural gas andor crude oil prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

in addition if we expect significant sustained decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled the cost of such operations may increase andor our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors including 

unexpected drilling conditions 

title problems 

pressure or irregularities in formations 

equipment failures or accidents 

adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns 

compliance with or changes in environmental and other laws and regulations such as tax laws and regulations 14

the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses 

the availability of costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties including leases pipelines and related facilities and equipment to gather process compress transport and market natural gas crude oil and related commodities 

costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs tubular materials and other necessary equipment and 

lack of necessary services andor qualified personnel 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to sell and deliver our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering processing compression and transportation services

the sale of our natural gas and crude oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from natural gas and crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are produced except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our reserves will decline as they are produced maintaining our production of natural gas and crude oil at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves as is in turn our future cash flow and results of operations

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position

specifically as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas moreover we are subject to the united states environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions changes in or additions to these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position

we are aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions we are also aware of legislation proposed by united states us lawmakers and by the canadian 

legislature to reduce ghg emissions we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary we are unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any such proposed laws regulations and treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position

a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including as a result of accidents weather conditions loss of gathering processing compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as natural gas or crude oil prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted our cash flow and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks may include among other risks 

loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks 

increases in taxes and governmental royalties 

unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities 

difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased companies and 

currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

if we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

from time to time we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements moreover there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being 

integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us

demand for natural gas and crude oil is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flow and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result relatively lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and increases in storm intensity which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation services such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition development production exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower natural gas and crude oil prices however would reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all the weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings moreover a reduction in our cash flow for example as a result of lower natural gas and crude oil prices and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay in addition a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us

we have various customers for the natural gas crude oil and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally have weakened in recent years and remain weak in addition there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets including the credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase natural gas crude oil or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to 

another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market natural gas and crude oil in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects such as in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the us from other countries and to a lesser extent alternative energy sources

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex inexact process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated moreover the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs many of which factors are or may be beyond our control our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk

we use derivative instruments primarily financial collars price swaps and basis swaps to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices on our results of operations and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in natural gas and crude oil prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities

the exploration for and production of natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities result in injury or death and damage property and the environment moreover our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration development and production activities and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 approximately 9 of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 

as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors

in general the rate of production from eogs natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are produced except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

united states and canada eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs natural gas and crude oil production in canada eog departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal gas growth in the horn river basin and horizontal oil growth within existing legacy fields mainly in waskada manitoba and highvale alberta in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately 86 of total company production in 2009 as compared to 87 in 2008 in 2009 the fort worth basin barnett shale and north dakota bakken areas produced an increasing amount of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids for 2009 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 22 of total company production as compared to 19 for 2008 based on current trends eog expects its 2010 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2009 eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada

during the third quarter of 2009 eog completed three transactions to acquire certain crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets located in montague and cooke counties texas barnett shale combo assets the barnett shale combo assets consist of proved developed and undeveloped reserves and approximately 33000 net unproved acres production from these assets averaged approximately 2300 barrels of oil equivalent per day net at the time of acquisition the aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled 1967 million consisting of cash consideration of 1071 million and 1450000 shares of eog common stock valued at 896 million on the closing date of the applicable transaction 

in october 2009 eog entered into an agreement to acquire unproved acreage located in nacogdoches county texas within the haynesville and bossier shale formations haynesville assets eog acquired 39500 net unproved acres at the principal and supplemental closings held in october 2009 and december 2009 respectively the acquisition agreement provides for an additional onetime supplemental cash payment to the sellers of the haynesville assets that is contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions within a fiveyear period beginning on the principal closing date set forth in the acquisition agreement with respect to future natural gas prices eog estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition dates in accordance with the provisions of the business combinations topic of the accounting standards codification asc and has included such amount in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the fair value of such contingent consideration was 353 million at december 31 2009 the aggregate consideration recorded in 2009 for the acquisition of the haynesville assets was 134 million including the contingent consideration additionally eog expects to acquire up to an additional 7500 net acres at a final closing expected to occur in the first quarter of 2010 the total price for the haynesville assets will not exceed 165 million

in november 2009 eog entered into an agreement to sell its crude oil and natural gas related assets located in california for cash consideration of 202 million subject to customary adjustments under the agreement the assets sold included approximately 80 wells that accounted for less than 1 of eogs total 2009 production the transaction closed on december 10 2009 eog realized a pretax gain of 146 million on the sale

in december 2009 eog and a third party entered into an asset exchange agreement whereby the two parties exchanged certain natural gas related properties in the rocky mountain area in accordance with provisions of the business combinations topic of the asc eog realized a pretax gain of 390 million on the exchange to reflect the excess of the fair value of the properties received over the book basis of the properties given up in the transaction 

in support of its operations in the north dakota bakken play eog constructed a crude oil loading facility near stanley north dakota designed to load crude oil into 100car unit trains for transport to stroud oklahoma at stroud oklahoma eog constructed a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the cushing oklahoma trading hub the first shipment of crude oil through these facilities occurred at yearend 2009 when fully operational the capacity of these facilities is expected to allow transport of approximately 60000 barrels per day of bakken crude oil 

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts in the pelican field eog drilled a successful exploratory well in late january 2010 that is expected to begin producing by the end of the first quarter of 2010 

in the united kingdom eog has ongoing production from the valkyrie and arthur fields in the southern gas basin of the north sea block 2316f there is currently one producing well in the arthur field and such well is expected to cease production during the first half of 2010 the operator and partners of the noneog operated columbus discovery in the central north sea are continuing to evaluate export routes for future production in addition the operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the united kingdom department of energy and climate change during the second quarter of 2010 and anticipates receiving approval in late 2010 

during the third quarter of 2009 eog completed a farmin agreement with the owners of the central north sea block 1530a area ab in december 2009 eog began drilling an exploratory well on this prospect the well was declared a dry hole in january 2010

eog continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the united kingdom during the second quarter of 2009 eog drilled two exploratory wells in the east irish sea well 11014b7 in which eog has a 70 working interest was a dry hole while well 110126 in which eog has 100 working interest was an oil discovery engineering studies were initiated with an intent to submit a field development plan to the united kingdom department of energy and climate change during the first quarter of 2010 a rig has been contracted and has begun drilling two further exploratory wells offsetting the oil discovery the first well was declared a dry hole in february 2010 and results for the second well are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2010

in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province china in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to additional shallower zones on the acreage purchased during the second quarter of 2009 eog completed a monitoring well and in the third quarter of 2009 drilled a horizontal well the horizontal well is being completed and will be tested during the first quarter of 2010 in addition to evaluate one of the shallower zones eog drilled a second monitoring well during the third quarter of 2009 and is currently drilling a second horizontal well that it plans to complete during the third quarter of 2010

eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group at december 31 2009 eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 22 during 2009 eog funded 38 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement costs and noncash acquisition costs paid 142 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased 11 million of treasury stock primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities proceeds from longterm debt borrowings proceeds from the sale of its california assets and the issuance of 145 million shares of eog common stock valued at 896 million

management has not finalized or recommended to eogs board a 2010 capital expenditures budget management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices including the quantities of natural gas in storage and north american natural gas supplies in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects all of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements eog expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter while eog currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget eog intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debttocapitalization ratio as compared to its peer group

when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

on may 21 2009 eog completed its public offering of 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 2019 notes interest on the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning december 1 2009 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 891 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues

during 2009 net operating revenues decreased 2340 million or 33 to 4787 million from 7127 million in 2008 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids decreased 2823 million or 45 to 3399 million from 6222 million in 2008 during 2009 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 432 million compared to net gains of 598 million in 2008 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 242 million or 147 to 407 million in 2009 from 165 million in 2008 gains on property dispositions net in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of 390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the rocky mountain area and a pretax gain of 146 million realized on the sale of eogs california assets gains on property dispositions net in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of 128 million on the sale of appalachian assets in february 2008 

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows

 1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 other international includes eogs united kingdom operations and effective july 1 2008 eogs china operations 3 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids

2009 compared to 2008 wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased 2401 million or 54 to 2051 million from 4452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 2460 million partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries 59 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54 to 342 per mcf in 2009 from 751 per mcf in 2008 

natural gas deliveries increased 26 mmcfd or 2 to 1645 mmcfd in 2009 from 1619 mmcfd in 2008 the increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 mmcfd in trinidad partially offset by lower production of 28 mmcfd in the united states and 6 mmcfd in the united kingdom the increase in trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 39 mmcfd and increased net contractual deliveries 16 mmcfd the decrease in the united states was primarily attributable to decreased production from texas 26 mmcfd new mexico 6 mmcfd mississippi 4 mmcfd kansas 3 mmcfd and oklahoma 3 mmcfd partially offset by increased production in louisiana 6 mmcfd and in the rocky mountain area 8 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased 368 million or 25 to 1090 million in 2009 from 1458 million in 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 675 million partially offset by an increase of 10 mbbld or 21 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 307 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota 8 mbbld and texas 2 mbbld the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38 to 5446 per barrel compared to 8818 per barrel for 2008

natural gas liquids revenues decreased 53 million or 17 to 259 million in 2009 from 312 million in 2008 due to a lower composite average price 201 million partially offset by an increase of 8 mbbld or 48 in natural gas liquids deliveries 148 million the composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44 to 3005 per barrel compared to 5342 per barrel for 2008 the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale area

gathering processing and marketing revenues represent sales of thirdparty natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas for the year ended december 31 2009 substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of thirdparty natural gas and crude oil for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 such revenues were primarily related to sales of thirdparty natural gas sales of thirdparty natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty natural gas and crude oil and the associated transportation costs

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased 2 million to 10 million in 2009 compared to 12 million in 2008 the decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the gulf coast area

2008 compared to 2007 wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased 1419 million or 47 to 4452 million from 3033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 1101 million and increased natural gas deliveries 318 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33 to 751 per mcf in 2008 from 565 per mcf in 2007 

natural gas deliveries increased 149 mmcfd or 10 to 1619 mmcfd in 2008 from 1470 mmcfd in 2007 the increase was due to higher production of 191 mmcfd in the united states and initial production of 5 mmcfd in china partially offset by lower production of 34 mmcfd in trinidad 11 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 140 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 54 mmcfd mississippi 8 mmcfd and kansas 4 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production due to the february 2008 sale of appalachian assets 15 mmcfd the decline in trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities 29 mmcfd and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 10 mmcfd partially offset by increased deliveries to atlantic lng train 4 alng 5 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 680 million or 87 to 1458 million in 2008 from 778 million in 2007 due to an increase of 143 mbbld or 46 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 358 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 322 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota 12 mbbld the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28 to 8818 per barrel compared to 6869 per barrel for 2007

natural gas liquids revenues increased 102 million or 49 to 312 million in 2008 from 210 million in 2007 due to increases in deliveries 67 million and a higher composite average price 35 million the composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13 to 5342 per barrel compared to 4736 per barrel for 2007 the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas

during 2008 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 598 million which included net realized losses of 137 million during 2007 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 93 million which included net realized gains of 128 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased 5 million to 12 million in 2008 compared to 7 million in 2007 the increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the gulf coast area

operating and other expenses

2009 compared to 2008  during 2009 operating expenses of 3816 million were 456 million higher than the 3360 million incurred in 2008 the following table presents the costs per thousand cubic feet equivalent mcfe for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008

 

  1 total excludes gathering and processing costs exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs natural gas and crude oil wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time

lease and well expenses of 579 million in 2009 increased 20 million from 559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in canada 16 million and the united states 14 million partially offset by changes in the canadian exchange rate 8 million and lower lease and well administrative expenses 5 million

transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from thirdparty carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs transportation fees and thirdparty costs associated with transporting crude oil

transportation costs of 283 million in 2009 increased 9 million from 274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area 19 million partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 8 million

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets compressors vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software 

dda expenses in 2009 increased 222 million to 1549 million from 1327 million in 2008 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties were 192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 42 million canada 9 million and trinidad 6 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 3 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 105 million canada 22 million and trinidad 13 million partially offset by changes in the canadian exchange rate 13 million

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 16 million and the rocky mountain area 9 million

ga expenses of 248 million in 2009 were 5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs 3 million and higher employeerelated costs 2 million

net interest expense of 101 million in 2009 increased 49 million from 52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 61 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 12 million

gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs gathering and processing assets

gathering and processing costs increased 17 million to 58 million in 2009 compared to 41 million in 2008 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 8 million and the rocky mountain area 8 million

exploration costs of 170 million in 2009 decreased 24 million from 194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the fort worth basin barnett shale area

impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

impairments of 306 million in 2009 increased 113 million from 193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states 103 million and increased impairments of proved properties in the united states 32 million partially offset by 2008 impairments in trinidad as a result of eogs relinquishment of its rights to block lower reverse l lrl 20 million and in the united kingdom for the arthur field 6 million eog recorded impairments of proved properties of 94 million and 86 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2009 decreased 147 million to 174 million 51 of wellhead revenues from 321 million 52 of wellhead revenues in 2008 the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severanceproduction taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the united states 103 million trinidad 13 million and canada 3 million an increase in credits taken in 2009 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 16 million and lower ad valoremproperty taxes in the united states 15 million

other income net was 2 million in 2009 compared to 31 million in 2008 the decrease of 29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad 15 million lower interest income 8 million and settlements received in 2008 related to the enron corp bankruptcy 3 million

income tax provision of 325 million in 2009 decreased 984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37 from 35 in 2008 the increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of lrl

2008 compared to 2007  during 2008 operating expenses of 3360 million were 769 million higher than the 2591 million incurred in 2007 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007

 

  1 total excludes gathering and processing costs exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2008 compared to 2007 are set forth below

lease and well expenses of 559 million in 2008 increased 107 million from 452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses 78 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses 28 million both in the united states

transportation costs of 274 million in 2008 increased 122 million from 152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the fort worth basin barnett shale area 64 million and the rocky mountain area 38 million to downstream markets

dda expenses in 2008 increased 261 million to 1327 million from 1066 million in 2007 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties were 236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 210 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 10 million and in trinidad 3 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 15 million and canada 8 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 11 million also contributed to the dda expense increase

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the fort worth basin barnett shale area

ga expenses of 244 million in 2008 were 38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 33 million the increase in employeerelated costs primarily reflects higher stockbased compensation expenses 18 million

net interest expense of 52 million in 2008 increased 5 million from 47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 18 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 13 million

gathering and processing costs increased 13 million to 41 million in 2008 as compared to 28 million in 2007 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas

exploration costs of 194 million in 2008 increased 44 million from 150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 27 million and higher employeerelated costs 15 million the increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states was primarily attributable to activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 21 million

impairments of 193 million in 2008 were 45 million higher than impairments of 148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 30 million and canada 12 million an impairment in trinidad recorded in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of eogs relinquishment of its rights to lrl 20 million and an impairment in the united kingdom for the arthur field 6 million partially offset by decreased impairments in canada 20 million eog recorded impairments of proved properties of 86 million and 82 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively

taxes other than income in 2008 increased 113 million to 321 million 52 of wellhead revenues from 208 million 52 of wellhead revenues in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severanceproduction taxes in the united states as a result of increased wellhead revenues 86 million a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 13 million and increased ad valoremproperty taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the united states 20 million 

income tax provision of 1310 million in 2008 increased 769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35 from 33 in 2007 the increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007

the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions

 

 1 in 2009 property acquisitions includes noncash additions of 353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the rocky mountain area and contingent consideration with a fair value of 35 million related to the acquisition of the haynesville assets

exploration and development expenditures of 3824 million for 2009 were 1088 million lower than the prior year due primarily to decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 1529 million canada 44 million and trinidad 41 million decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in canada 122 million decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 23 million changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in canada 16 million decreased property acquisition expenditures in trinidad 15 million canada 14 million and china 10 million and decreased dry hole costs in canada 11 million and the united states 4 million these decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisition expenditures in the united states 638 million increased drilling and facilities expenditures in china 41 million and the united kingdom 10 million increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 29 million increased capitalized interest in the united states 15 million and increased dry hole costs in the united kingdom 12 million the 2009 exploration and development expenditures of 3824 million include 2082 million in development 980 million in exploration 707 million in property acquisitions and 55 million in capitalized interest the decrease in expenditures for other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale area the 2008 exploration and development expenditures of 4912 million include 3612 million in development 1148 million in exploration 109 million in property acquisitions and 43 million in capitalized interest the increase in expenditures for other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas the 2007 exploration and development expenditures of 3568 million include 2681 million in development 838 million in exploration 29 million in capitalized interest and 20 million in property acquisitions 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom and china such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

derivative transactions

during 2009 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 432 million which included net realized gains of 1278 million during 2008 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 598 million which included net realized losses of 137 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 22 at december 31 2009 compared to 17 at december 31 2008 

during 2009 total debt increased 900 million to 2797 million the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 3056 million and 1933 million respectively the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2009 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in a 187 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2009 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the offering of its 5625 senior notes due 2019 described below proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 10 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2009 was 675 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2009 was 17 million with no amounts outstanding at yearend eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

on may 21 2009 eog completed its public offering of 900 million aggregate principal amount of 5625 senior notes due 2019 2019 notes interest on the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning december 1 2009 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 891 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2009 in thousands

 

1 this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits eogs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement abandonment and asset retirement obligations see notes 5 6 and 14 respectively to consolidated financial statements 2 amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31 2009 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 3 amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services eogs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment for example pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2009 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom and china the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2009 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2009 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc under those provisions as of december 31 2009 eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of 49 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of 5 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook

pricing natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids prices however crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of eogs production mix in 2009 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2010 longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels such as crude oil and coal the market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2010 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact the level of eogs 2010 total capital expenditures as well as its production

including the impact of eogs 2010 natural gas hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2010 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 30 million for net income and 45 million for cash flows from operating activities eogs price sensitivity in 2010 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 22 million for net income and 33 million for cash flows from operating activities for information regarding eogs natural gas hedge position as of december 31 2009 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities 

management has not finalized or recommended to eogs board a 2010 capital expenditures budget management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices including the quantities of natural gas in storage and north american natural gas supplies in addition eog continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects all of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements eog expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter while eog currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget eog intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debttocapitalization ratio as compared to its peer group

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2010 by 13 over 2009 levels total united states production is expected to increase by 15 comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 53 and 31 respectively 

environmental regulations

various foreign federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations these laws and regulations could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control and under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator moreover eog is subject to the united states environmental protection agencys us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions

compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations or competitive position it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues in addition to the us epas rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions eog is also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers and the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions as well as ghg emissions regulations enacted by certain of the canadian provinces in which eog operates eog is unable to predict the timing scope and effect of any such proposed laws regulations and treaties but the direct and indirect costs of such laws regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change in addition eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

oil and gas exploration costs

eog accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2009 and 2008 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 16 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets including natural gas gathering and processing facilities are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries  oil and gas topic of the asc the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor property dispositions and 4 impairments 

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a propertybyproperty basis for any impairment in value unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

stockbased compensation

in accounting for stockbased compensation judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil exploration and production related 

exploration and production 

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada 

at december 31 2008 82 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and 18 were crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of the applicable technologies described above eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2008 and certain 2009 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states  eog continues to grow production and future reserve potential in the barnett shale play of the fort worth basin in 2008 eog began selling production from 410 net wells drilled during the year and grew production to a net average daily rate of 413 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas and 66 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids at yearend 2008 eogs net production had increased to approximately 509 million cubic feet equivalent per day mmcfed and net acreage held was approximately 990000 acres during 2008 eog continued to experience successful drilling in johnson hill and the western extension counties of the barnett shale gas play additionally eog saw successful drilling in the barnett combo play located in the northern portion of the fort worth basin the barnett combo play was previously known as the barnett oil play but as a result of the wells in this play producing roughly onethird crude oil onethird natural gas liquids and onethird natural gas the name combo seemed more appropriate for 2009 eog plans to begin selling production from approximately 260 net wells with a focus on maximizing the recovery of hydrocarbons in place and cost reduction eog expects the barnett shale play to continue to add production and reserve growth to eog for many years to come

eog significantly expanded its activities in 2008 throughout the rocky mountain area where it holds approximately 16 million net acres during 2008 353 net wells were drilled in the core areas 210 net wells were drilled in the uinta basin utah 64 net wells were drilled in north dakota and montana in the williston basin 45 net wells were drilled in the moxa arch area of wyoming and 21 net wells were drilled in the labarge platform wyoming production from the rocky mountain area increased 57 with this expanded drilling activity the net average production for 2008 was 232 mmcfd of natural gas and 266 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eog ended 2008 producing approximately 24 mbbld net of crude oil from the bakken play in north dakota and intends to drill over 45 net wells in the play in 2009 the majority of the production growth in the rocky mountain area was derived from very active drilling programs in the north dakota bakken and the uinta basin mesaverde development plays eog expects to remain active in these two areas in 2009 and plans to continue its exploration program throughout the rocky mountain area

in the midcontinent area eog drilled 106 net wells during 2008 in its core areas in southwest kansas the oklahoma panhandle and the texas panhandle the net average production for 2008 was 84 mmcfd of natural gas and 47 mbbld of crude oil and condensate which represents an 11 total production increase over 2007 eog continued its strong exploration program in southwest kansas and was successful in finding several new morrow and st louis plays as part of the hugotondeep play eog has seven years remaining on an approximately 900000 gross acre 10year farmin agreement from anadarko petroleum company in addition to its existing cleveland horizontal play in the texas panhandle a new discovery in the atoka formation was established and exploited in 2008 eog holds approximately 100000 net acres in the play to date 37 horizontal wells have been drilled with initial production rates up to 70 mmcfd of natural gas plans for 2009 are to continue exploiting these growth areas while pursuing other exploration prospects throughout the midcontinent area eog holds approximately 500000 net acres in the midcontinent area

eogs south texas and gulf of mexico areas had another successful year in 2008 drilling 89 net wells south texas and gulf of mexico net production averaged 207 mmcfd of natural gas and 68 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids during 2008 eogs activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio duval and matagorda counties where eog drilled successful wells in the lobo roleta frio and wilcox trends eogs application of horizontal drilling technology in south texas continues to increase and the percentage of horizontal wells drilled in the area significantly increased in 2008 a number of additional trends will be exploited with the application of horizontal drilling in 2009 production from two deepwater gulf of mexico wells drilled in the atwater valley area began in february 2008 at a peak rate of 117 mmcfd of natural gas gross and 19 mmcfd net to eog approximately 68 net wells are planned during 2009 for south texas and the gulf of mexico where eog holds approximately 580000 net acres

during 2008 eog drilled and participated in 48 net wells in the permian basin twentynine net wells were drilled in new mexico of which 20 were drilled in the wolfcamp horizontal play and the others were drilled in the morrow bone spring and permopenn formations nineteen net wells were drilled in west texas in multiple objectives net production averaged 79 mmcfd of natural gas and 68 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids several new oil projects were identified and acreage assembled for testing in 2009 over 330 square miles of 3d seismic were acquired in 2008 to assist with these new projects with the addition of 97500 acres in 2008 eog now has approximately 540000 net acres in the permian basin eog expects to remain active in the permian basin in 2009 and will pursue several exploration prospects in these same areas

the upper gulf coast continued to be a growth area for eog where 2008 net production grew 6 year over year and averaged 146 mmcfd of natural gas and 31 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eog drilled 62 net wells with 36 net wells in the cotton valley and travis peak development programs located in east texas and north louisiana at the sligo driscoll appleby and waterman fields mississippi remained a growth area where 26 net wells were drilled in 2008 and horizontal development of the selma chalk at the gwinville field was also successful eog is further expanding horizontal drilling programs in this area with the development of approximately 116000 net acres in the emerging haynesville play where eog is currently drilling its third horizontal well eog holds approximately 350000 net acres in the upper gulf coast area

in february 2008 eog completed the sale of approximately 2400 shallow devonian wells with net production of 17 mmcfd of natural gas in the appalachian basin eog retained the deep rights on the acreage involved in the sale during the second half of the year the focus was entirely on evaluating the marcellus shale drilling six horizontal and three vertical wells these wells tested acreage blocks in bradford county pennsylvania as well as blocks in the seneca resources joint venture in north central pennsylvania eog has tested wells in each of these areas that initially flowed at rates in excess of 3 mmcfd of natural gas plans for 2009 include the drilling of 14 gross wells both horizontal and vertical and developing the infrastructure necessary to market the gas from the drilling program eog holds approximately 220000 net acres in this area 

at december 31 2008 eog held approximately 3646000 net undeveloped acres in the united states 

during 2008 eog continued the growth of its gathering and processing activities in the barnett shale play of north texas and the bakken shale play of north dakota in 2008 eog placed into operation one natural gas processing plant in north dakota and constructed a second plant in north texas that came online in early 2009 eog installed an additional gathering system in the barnett combo play of north texas to transport production to its processing plant and continued expansion of its system in the bakken shale play of north dakota the north texas systems total over 70 miles of 8inch 10inch and 20inch diameter pipe while the north dakota system totals over 100 miles of 8inch pipe at yearend 2008 the combined throughput of these systems was 56 mmcfd of natural gas 

eog expects to continue expanding these facilities to accommodate the drilling activity in the barnett shale and bakken shale plays in the north dakota bakken shale play eog received confirmation from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on january 12 2009 to install an approximately 80mile 12inch diameter dense phase gas gathering pipeline connecting its stanley north dakota gathering system with the alliance pipeline near upham north dakota with startup planned for the third quarter of 2009 the alliance pipeline transports natural gas to major markets in chicago illinois as a part of that project eog expects to replace its 20 mmcfd natural gas liquids processing plant located near stanley north dakota with an 80 mmcfd refrigeration oilcondensate removal plant during the second quarter of 2009 in combination these projects will allow eog to efficiently transport the associated natural gas and natural gas liquids production from its bakken oil wells

canada eog conducts operations through its subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in calgary alberta during 2008 eogrc continued with its shallow gas strategy in western canada drilling a total of 474 net wells key producing areas are the southeast albertasouthwest saskatchewan shallow gas trends including the drumheller twining and halkirk areas the pembinahighvale area of central alberta the grande prairiewapiti area of northwest alberta and the waskada area of southwest manitoba during 2008 increased capital was directed to oil development projects principally at the waskada and highvale large legacy fields which were initially developed with vertical wells resulting in low recoveries horizontal drilling coupled with specific zone targeting along with new completion techniques have yielded favorable results as a result eog plans large fieldscale redevelopments for 2009 and beyond 

in the horn river basin of northeastern british columbia eogrc drilled three vertical and five horizontal wells during 2008 and concluded completion operations on two horizontal wells drilled in 2007 initial gas sales began in july 2008 and currently eogrc has seven producing wells plans for 2009 include drilling seven horizontal wells to further test eogrcs net acre position

in 2008 total canadian net production averaged 222 mmcfd of natural gas and 37 mbbld of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids eogrc plans to drill approximately 180 net wells in 2009 

at december 31 2008 eogrc held approximately 1655000 net undeveloped acres in canada

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations is sold to either ngc or its subsidiary under five gas sales contracts approximately 380 mmcfd gross 225 mmcfd net are sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes approximately 30 mmcfd gross 12 mmcfd net are sold under a contract for use in the atlantic lng train 4 alng plant at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2009

in october 2008 eog finalized crude oil and condensate sales contracts with the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago the pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin 

in 2008 eogs average net production from trinidad was 218 mmcfd of natural gas and 32 mbbld of crude oil and condensate 

at december 31 2008 eog held approximately 156000 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom in 2002 eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk acquired a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916 located in the southern gas basin of the north sea in august 2004 production commenced in the valkyrie field in the southern gas basin 

in 2003 eoguk acquired a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea since november 2003 three successful exploratory wells have been drilled in the arthur field with production commencing in january 2005 there are currently two producing wells in the arthur field one or both of which could cease production during the second half of 2009

in 2006 eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f a successful columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007 the field operator submitted a field development plan to the department of energy and climate change during the fourth quarter of 2008 eoguk also participated in the drilling of an unsuccessful exploratory well in august 2007 on the eos prospect located in the southern north sea block 4811c 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 eoguk was awarded three central north sea operated licenses in the uk 25th seaward licensing round a rig was contracted to drill two operated wells in the east irish sea in 2009 the licenses for the east irish sea were awarded to eog in 2007

other international eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

marketing

wellhead marketing eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts based on prevailing market prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the spot market in 2008 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2009 in 2008 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is expected to remain the same in 2009 in 2008 all of the wellhead natural gas volumes from china were sold under a contract with prices based on the purchasers pipeline sales prices to various local market segments the pricing mechanism for the contract in china is expected to remain the same in 2009

substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids are sold under various terms and arrangements based on prevailing market prices

in certain instances eog purchases natural gas production from third parties under buysell or other arrangements in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas 

during 2008 no single purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs natural gas and crude oil revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf crude oil and condensate per barrel bbl and natural gas liquids per bbl the table also presents natural gas equivalent volumes which are determined using the ratio of 60 mcf of natural gas to 10 bbl of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids delivered during each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006

 1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 other international includes eogs united kingdom operations and effective july 1 2008 eogs china operations 3 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids 4 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable

competition

eog competes with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market natural gas and crude oil moreover many of eogs competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those eog possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which eog may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence eog may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of eogs larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels eog also faces competition from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries and to a lesser extent alternative energy sources

regulation 

united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by state and federal agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds regulate environmental and safety matters and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments production taxes and ad valorem taxes 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior mms approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the mms may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely affect eogs interests

sales of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 these statutes are administered by the ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales

eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be 

adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc and the federal and state regulatory commissions and courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues eog is also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers to reduce ghg emissions any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect eogs business results of operations and financial condition eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout our operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice eog will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters including climate change

canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production  the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the crude oil and natural gas industry with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic political or other factors the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities could increase eogs costs and may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eogs operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from freehold lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and 

royalties royalties payable on lands that the crown has an interest in are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow

the alberta government implemented a new crude oil and natural gas royalty framework effective january 2009 the new framework establishes new royalties for conventional crude oil natural gas and bitumen that are linked to price and production levels and apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects under the new framework the formula for conventional crude oil and natural gas royalties uses a sliding rate formula dependant on the market price and production volumes royalty rates for conventional crude oil range from 0 to 50 and natural gas royalty rates range from 5 to 50 

the deep oil exploration program doep and the natural gas deep drilling program ngddp are new programs that began january 1 2009 in alberta these programs provide upfront royalty adjustments to new wells to qualify for royalty adjustments under the doep exploration wells must have a vertical depth greater than 2000 meters with a crown interest and must be spudded after january 1 2009 these oil wells qualify for a royalty exemption on either the first 1000000 canadian dollars of royalty or the first 12 months of production the ngddp applies to wells producing at a vertical depth greater than 2500 meters the ngddp will have an escalating royalty credit in line with progressively deeper wells from 625 canadian dollars per meter to a maximum of 3750 canadian dollars per meter there are additional benefits for the deepest wells both the doep and the ngddp are fiveyear programs any wells spudded after december 31 2013 or any wells for which eog chooses the transition option described below will not qualify under either program no royalty adjustments will be granted under either the doep or the ngddp after december 31 2018

in november 2008 the alberta government announced that companies drilling new natural gas and conventional crude oil wells at depths between 1000 and 3500 meters which are spudded between november 19 2008 and december 31 2013 will have a onetime option of selecting new transitional royalty rates or the new royalty framework rates the transition option provides lower royalties in the initial years of a wells life for example under the transition option royalty rates for natural gas wells will range from 5 to 30 the election is made prior to the end of the first calendar month in which the commodity is produced all wells using the transitional royalty rates must shift to the new royalty framework rates on january 1 2014 

eog expects these regulations of the alberta government to have a marginally positive impact on eogs financial condition and results of operations

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations and financial condition 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or may result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations such contamination is not unusual within the crude oil and natural gas industry any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions 

with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under canadian laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

canada is a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change the canadian federal government has indicated an intention to regulate industrial emissions of ghg and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors in the regulatory framework for air emissions released april 2007 and updated in a march 2008 document entitled turning the corner regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions collectively federal plan the federal plan outlines proposed policies to reduce the emissions of ghg and air pollutants by establishing mandatory emissions reduction requirements on a sector basis sectorspecific regulations are expected to come into effect in 2010 and targets would be based on percentages rather than absolute reductions the federal plan also proposes a credit emissions trading system additionally regulation can take place at the provincial and municipal level for example the alberta government regulates ghg emissions under the climate change and emissions management act the specified gas reporting regulation which imposes ghg emissions reporting requirements and the specified gas emitters regulation which imposes ghg emissions limits any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect eogs business results of operations and financial condition

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad the united kingdom and china 

other matters

energy prices since eog is primarily a natural gas producer it is more significantly impacted by changes in prices of natural gas than changes in prices of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in a 30 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price for production in the united states and canada received by eog from 2007 to 2008 a decrease of 4 from 2006 to 2007 and a decrease of 15 from 2005 to 2006 the average new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas price strip for 2009 has declined approximately 15 subsequent to december 31 2008 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of eogs product mix in 2008 than in prior years and is expected to increase further in 2009 average crude oil and condensate prices received by eog for production in the united states increased by 27 in 2008 10 in 2007 and 15 in 2006 each as compared to the immediately preceding year the average nymex crude oil price strip for 2009 has declined approximately 10 subsequent to december 31 2008 due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ammonia and methanol prices in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in natural gas and crude oil prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item 1a risk factors

including the impact of eogs 2009 natural gas hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2009 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 17 million for net income and 25 million for operating cash flow eogs price sensitivity in 2009 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 14 million for net income and 21 million for operating cash flow for information regarding eogs natural gas hedge position as of december 31 2008 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily collar price swap and basis swap contracts as the means to manage this price risk eog accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the marktomarket accounting method in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales 

exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  derivative transactions

 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material and adverse effect on us

prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely since we are primarily a natural gas company we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are

the level of consumer demand 

supplies of natural gas and crude oil 

weather conditions 

domestic and international drilling activity 

the price and availability of competing energy sources including liquefied natural gas 

the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities 

worldwide economic and political conditions 

the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including by commodity price speculators and others 

the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and 

the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation including environmental regulations 

our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil prolonged or substantial declines in natural gas andor crude oil prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 

in addition if we expect significant sustained decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil properties falls below the net book value of our properties we may be required to write down the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and in turn the trading price of our common stock

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells

specifically we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells and our drilling operations and those of our thirdparty operators may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the cost of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including 

unexpected drilling conditions 

title problems 

pressure or irregularities in formations 

equipment failures or accidents 

adverse weather conditions 

compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements 

the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses 

the availability of costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties including leases pipelines and related facilities and equipment to gather process compress transport and market natural gas crude oil and related commodities 

costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs tubular materials and other necessary equipment and 

lack of necessary services andor qualified personnel 

our failure to recover our investment in wells increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators andor curtailments delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our thirdparty operators may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to sell and deliver our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering processing compression and transportation services

the sale of our natural gas and crude oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of and costs associated with gathering processing compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable if at all any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from natural gas and crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration exploitation and development activities acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced maintaining our production of natural gas and crude oil at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves as is in turn our future cash flow and results of operations

a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 

a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be interrupted or shut in from time to time for various reasons including as a result of accidents weather conditions loss of gathering processing compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as natural gas or crude oil prices that we deem uneconomic if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted our cash flow and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we operate in other countries and as a result are subject to certain political economic and other risks 

our operations in jurisdictions outside the united states us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations these risks may include among other risks 

loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation war and other political risks 

increases in taxes and governmental royalties 

renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities 

difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased companies and 

currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties moreover we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

if we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems to accurately estimate reserves production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired properties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

from time to time we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements moreover there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates in addition an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations

weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us

demand for natural gas and crude oil is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts among other things the price we receive for the commodities we produce and in turn our cash flow and results of operations for example relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and as a result relatively lower prices for natural gas production 

in addition our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of and our access to necessary thirdparty services such as gathering processing compression and transportation such extreme weather conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition development production exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower natural gas and crude oil prices however would reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable if at all the recent credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk and related thereto the recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings in addition a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us

we have various customers for the natural gas crude oil and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions domestic and global economic conditions including the financial condition of financial institutions generally have recently weakened in addition there has been recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets 

including the credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 

moreover our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions furthermore if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase natural gas crude oil or related commodities from us we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable if at all due to the geographic location of such production the availability proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions

the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases properties and reserves and the equipment materials services and employees and other personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists required to explore for develop produce and market natural gas and crude oil in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels we also face competition from competing energy sources such as liquefied natural gas imported into the us from other countries and to a lesser extent alternative energy sources

reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 

estimating quantities of proved natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated moreover the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business 

and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations moreover we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental safety and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and in turn materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

specifically as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues we are also aware of legislation proposed by us lawmakers and by the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may materially and adversely affect eogs business results of operations and financial condition

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and may expose us to other risks including counterparty risk

we use derivative instruments primarily financial collars price swaps and basis swaps to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices on our results of operations and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in natural gas and crude oil prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities

the exploration for and production of natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities injure or kill people and damage property and the environment moreover our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration development and production activities and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team

our business and prospects for future success including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team the loss of any member of our management team and our inability to attract motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues 

and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the amount has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 approximately 11 of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations any such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of energy supplies and markets increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors

in general the rate of production from eogs natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities or through engineering studies identifies additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves for related discussion see item 1a risk factors eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom north sea and china eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return drilling internally generated prospects delivering longterm production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet

net income available to common stockholders for 2008 of 2436 million was up 125 compared to 2007 net income available to common stockholders of 1083 million at december 31 2008 eogs total reserves were 87 trillion cubic feet equivalent an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december 31 2007

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2008 

united states and canada eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs natural gas and crude oil production production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately 87 of total company production in 2008 as compared to 83 in 2007 in 2008 the fort worth basin barnett shale and north dakota bakken areas produced an increasing amount of crude oil and natural gas liquids for 2008 crude oil and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 19 of total company production as compared to 15 for 2007 based on current trends eog expects its 2009 crude oil and natural gas liquids production to increase as compared to 2008 eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico north dakota texas utah wyoming and western canada

in february 2008 eog closed on the sale of the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the appalachian basin to a subsidiary of exco resources inc an independent oil and gas company for approximately 386 million 40 million of which was received in 2007 the appalachian area that was divested included approximately 2400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1 of eogs total 2007 production and approximately 2 of its total yearend 2007 proved reserves eog retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area including rights in the marcellus shale and continued its shale exploration program in 2008 

in the third quarter of 2008 eog commenced production in its british columbia canada shale gas play eog holds approximately 158000 net acres in this play at december 31 2008 and expects to slowly increase production until 2012 when the construction of additional infrastructure for the play is expected to be completed 

international in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts in february 2008 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidad limited eogrt purchased an 80 working interest in the exploration and production license covering the pelican field and its related facilities from trinidad and tobago marine petroleum company limited the acquisition includes the subsurface rights offshore facilities the condensate transport line and the onshore storage facilities 

in october 2008 eog through its subsidiaries eogrt eog resources trinidadua block limited and eog resources trinidad ub block unlimited eogrt ub finalized crude oil and condensate sales contracts with the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago the pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin

in april 2008 eogs subsidiary eog resources trinidadlrl unlimited relinquished its rights to lower reverse l block and recorded an impairment of 20 million in december 2008 eog through its subsidiaries eogrt and eogrt ub began production from the oilbird field

eog continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the united kingdom uk in addition to its ongoing production from the valkyrie and arthur fields in the southern gas basin of the north sea block 2316f there are currently two producing wells in the arthur field one or both of which could cease production during the second half of 2009 during the fourth quarter of 2008 eog recorded an impairment of 6 million 3 million aftertax for its arthur field based on well performance during 2008 a field development plan was submitted for the columbus discovery in the central north sea in the fourth quarter of 2008 eoguk was awarded three central north sea operated licenses in the uk 25th seaward licensing round a rig was contracted to drill two operated wells in the east irish sea in 2009 the licenses for the east irish sea were awarded to eog in 2007 

in july 2008 eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin sichuan province the peoples republic of china the acquisition includes production of approximately 9 million cubic feet equivalent per day net on approximately 130000 acres in october 2008 eog obtained the rights to additional zones on the acreage purchased eog plans to drill its first horizontal well in 2009

eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group at december 31 2008 eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 17 during 2008 eog funded 54 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures paid 115 million in dividends to common and preferred stockholders repaid 38 million of debt and paid 5 million for the redemption of all remaining shares of its outstanding 7195 fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock series b with a 1000 liquidation preference per share series b primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities proceeds from longterm debt borrowings and proceeds from the sale of its appalachian assets

for 2009 eogs budget for exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures is approximately 31 billion excluding acquisitions united states and canada crude oil and natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures eog intends to manage the 2009 capital budget in order to balance expenditures with operating cash flows when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

on september 30 2008 eog completed its public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 6125 senior notes due 2013 and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 collectively notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning april 1 2009 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 743 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities

 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues

during 2008 net operating revenues increased 2888 million or 68 to 7127 million from 4239 million in 2007 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of eogs production of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids increased 2202 million or 55 to 6222 million from 4020 million in 2007 during 2008 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 598 million compared to net gains of 93 million in 2007 gathering processing and marketing revenues which are revenues generated from sales of thirdparty natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas increased 91 million or 124 to 165 million in 2008 from 74 million in 2007 other net operating revenues in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of 128 million on the sale of the appalachian assets in february 2008 the following review of operations gives effect to the reclassifications discussed in note 1 to consolidated financial statements

wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were as follows

 1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 other international includes eogs united kingdom operations and effective july 1 2008 eogs china operations 3 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 10 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids

2008 compared to 2007 wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased 1419 million or 47 to 4452 million from 3033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 1101 million and increased natural gas deliveries 318 million eogs composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33 to 751 per mcf in 2008 from 565 per mcf in 2007 

natural gas deliveries increased 149 mmcfd or 10 to 1619 mmcfd in 2008 from 1470 mmcfd in 2007 the increase was due to higher production of 191 mmcfd in the united states and initial production of 5 mmcfd in china partially offset by lower production of 34 mmcfd in trinidad 11 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 140 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 54 mmcfd mississippi 8 mmcfd and kansas 4 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production due to the february 2008 sale of the appalachian assets 15 mmcfd the decline in trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities 29 mmcfd and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 10 mmcfd partially offset by increased deliveries to atlantic lng train 4 alng 5 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 680 million or 87 to 1458 million in 2008 from 778 million in 2007 due to an increase of 143 mbbld or 46 in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 358 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 322 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota 12 mbbld the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28 to 8818 per barrel compared to 6869 per barrel for 2007

natural gas liquids revenues increased 102 million or 49 to 312 million in 2008 from 210 million in 2007 due to increases in deliveries 67 million and a higher composite average price 35 million the composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13 to 5342 per barrel compared to 4736 per barrel for 2007 the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas

during 2008 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 598 million which included realized losses of 137 million during 2007 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 93 million which included realized gains of 128 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues represent sales of thirdparty natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering thirdparty natural gas for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of thirdparty natural gas marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing thirdparty natural gas and the associated transportation costs

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased 5 million to 12 million in 2008 compared to 7 million in 2007 the increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the gulf coast area

2007 compared to 2006 wellhead natural gas revenues in 2007 increased 240 million or 9 to 3033 million from 2793 million in 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries 277 million partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 37 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to 565 per mcf in 2007 from 572 per mcf in 2006 

natural gas deliveries increased 133 mmcfd or 10 to 1470 mmcfd in 2007 from 1337 mmcfd in 2006 the increase was due to higher production of 154 mmcfd in the united states partially offset by lower production of 12 mmcfd in trinidad 7 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 119 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 13 mmcfd kansas 13 mmcfd and mississippi 10 mmcfd the decline in trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to alng 10 mmcfd and a decrease in contractual demand 2 mmcfd during 2006 eog supplied gas for use in alngs startup phase in 2007 alng remained in the startup phase but did not require any gas from eog until may 2007 when alng reached commercial status and eog began supplying gas under the alng takeorpay contract the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 153 million or 24 to 778 million in 2007 from 625 million in 2006 due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 81 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 72 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price in 2007 was 6869 per barrel compared to 6238 per barrel in 2006

natural gas liquids revenues increased 73 million or 53 to 210 million in 2007 from 137 million in 2006 due to increases in deliveries 42 million and a higher composite average price 31 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale and south texas areas

during 2007 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 93 million which included realized gains of 128 million during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million 

gathering processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2007 increased 4 million to 7 million in 2007 from 3 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased natural gas marketing operations in the gulf coast area

operating and other expenses

2008 compared to 2007  during 2008 operating expenses of 3360 million were 769 million higher than the 2591 million incurred in 2007 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007

 

  1 total perunit costs do not include gathering and processing costs exploration costs dry hole costs impairments marketing costs and taxes other than income

the primary factors impacting the cost components of perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2008 as compared to 2007 are set forth below

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs crude oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other expenses pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time

lease and well expenses of 559 million in 2008 increased 107 million from 452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses 78 million and higher lease and well administrative expenses 28 million both in the united states

transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from thirdparty carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs and transportation fees

transportation costs of 274 million in 2008 increased 122 million from 152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the fort worth basin barnett shale area 64 million and the rocky mountain area 38 million to downstream markets

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year dda of the cost of other property plant and equipment is calculated using the straightline depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets other property plant and equipment consist of natural gas gathering and processing facilities compressors vehicles buildings and leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software 

dda expenses in 2008 increased 261 million to 1327 million from 1066 million in 2007 dda expenses associated with oil and gas properties were 236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 210 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 10 million and in trinidad 3 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 15 million and canada 8 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 11 million also contributed to the dda expense increase

dda expenses associated with other property plant and equipment were 25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the fort worth basin barnett shale area

ga expenses of 244 million in 2008 were 38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 33 million the increase in employeerelated costs primarily reflects higher stockbased compensation expenses 18 million

net interest expense of 52 million in 2008 increased 5 million from 47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 18 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 13 million

gathering and processing costs represent operation and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eogs natural gas gathering and processing assets

gathering and processing costs increased 13 million to 41 million in 2008 as compared to 28 million in 2007 the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas

exploration costs of 194 million in 2008 increased 44 million from 150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 27 million and higher employeerelated costs 15 million the increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states was primarily attributable to activities in the fort worth basin barnett shale area 21 million

impairments include amortization of unproved leases as well as impairments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of longlived assets based on future cash flow analysis impairments of 193 million in 2008 were 45 million higher than impairments of 148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states 30 million and canada 12 million an sfas no 144 related impairment in trinidad as a result of eogs relinquishment of its rights to lower reverse l block 20 million and an sfas no 144 related 

impairment in the united kingdom for the arthur field 6 million partially offset by decreased sfas no 144 related impairments in canada 20 million under sfas no 144 eog recorded impairments of 86 million and 82 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

taxes other than income in 2008 increased 113 million to 321 million 52 of wellhead revenues from 208 million 52 of wellhead revenues in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severanceproduction taxes in the united states as a result of increased wellhead revenues 86 million a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 13 million and increased ad valoremproperty taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the united states 20 million 

income tax provision of 1310 million in 2008 increased 769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income the net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35 from 33 in 2007 the increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007

2007 compared to 2006  during 2007 operating expenses of 2591 million were 566 million higher than the 2025 million incurred in 2006 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 17 at december 31 2008 compared to 14 at december 31 2007 

during 2008 total debt increased 712 million to 1897 million the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 1933 million and 1227 million respectively the fair value of debt is the value eog would have to pay to retire the debt including any premium or discount to the debtholder for the differential between the stated interest rate and the yearend market rate the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2008 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in an 115 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 2 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2008 and 2007 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the offering of its 6125 senior notes due 2013 and its 6875 senior notes due 2018 described below proceeds from the sale of eogs appalachian assets cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper other uncommitted credit facilities and a revolving credit facility to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 10 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2008 was 704 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2008 was 130 million with no amounts outstanding at yearend eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

on september 30 2008 eog completed its public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 6125 senior notes due 2013 and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due 2018 collectively notes interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning april 1 2009 net proceeds from the offering of approximately 743 million were used for general

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2008 in thousands

 

1 this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits eogs pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties see notes 5 6 and 14 respectively to consolidated financial statements 2 amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31 2008 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 3 amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services eogs expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment for example pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2008 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad the united kingdom and china the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2008 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2008 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended under those provisions as of december 31 2008 eog recorded the fair value of the swap of 26 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of 7 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook 

pricing natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids prices however crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids comprised a larger portion of eogs product mix in 2008 than in prior years and is expected to increase further in 2009 longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels such as oil and coal the market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2009 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities which will in turn impact the level of eogs 2009 total capital expenditures as well as its production

including the impact of eogs 2009 natural gas hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2009 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 17 million for net income and 25 million for operating cash flow eogs price sensitivity in 2009 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price is approximately 14 million for net income and 21 million for operating cash flow for information regarding eogs natural gas hedge position as of december 31 2008 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada in 2009 eog expects to allocate a slightly lower percentage of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the fort worth basin barnett shale area and the rocky mountain operating area than in 2008 eog will also execute a steady drilling program to further develop the british columbia horn river basin in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities budgeted 2009 exploration and development expenditures excluding acquisitions are approximately 2850 million in addition budgeted 2009 expenditures for gathering and processing and other assets are approximately 250 million the total 2009 capital expenditures budget of approximately 31 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow

the level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2009 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors based upon existing economic and market conditions 

eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2009 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year however eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration exploitation development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad the united kingdom north sea and china such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

operations eog expects to increase overall production in 2009 by 3 over 2008 levels based on average natural gas prices of 500 per mcf at henry hub west texas intermediate crude oil prices of 5000 per barrel and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of 2850 million excluding acquisitions united states production is expected to increase by 2 with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 10 and 24 respectively 

environmental regulations

various foreign federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local state national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues we are also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers and the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions as well as ghg emissions regulations enacted by certain of the canadian provinces in which eog operates eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect eogs business results of operations and financial condition 

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and 

economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

oil and gas exploration costs

eog accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2008 and 2007 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 16 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized 

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is recognized unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical experience is amortized over the average holding period if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets including natural gas gathering and processing facilities are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 

assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas no 19 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor property dispositions and 4 impairments 

stockbased compensation

effective january 1 2006 eog accounts for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123 r share based payment in applying the provisions of sfas no 123 r judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

business segments

eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil exploration and production related

exploration and production

united states and canada operations 

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada

at december 31 2007 84 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and 16 were crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the application of new processes and technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2007 and certain 2008 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states  in the prolific barnett shale play of the fort worth basin eog which holds approximately 900000 net acres has become an industry leader in per well production rates through the application of advanced drilling and completion technology in 2007 eog continued a very active drilling program and had strong production growth for the year eog drilled 293 net wells and grew production to a net average of 271 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas and 22 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog ended 2007 with production of approximately 375 million cubic feet equivalent per day mmcfed net and expects to significantly grow production during 2008 with the plan to drill and complete over 400 net wells using innovative technology eog is generating significant new growth opportunities in the fort worth basin that are expected to add to its future reserve and production growth potential 

the upper gulf coast continued to be a growth area for eog where 2007 net production grew 12 year over year and averaged 135 mmcfd of natural gas and 35 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids in 2007 eog drilled 90 net wells in the upper gulf coast area with 67 net wells in the sligo minden carthage driscoll logansport and appleby fields of the cotton valley and travis peak formations in east texas and north louisiana mississippi remained a major growth area where 23 successful net wells were drilled in the sligo and hosston plays in south williamsburg and two new discoveries were made in the columbia and whitesand fields eog is currently one of the largest natural gas producers in mississippi eog which holds approximately 300000 net acres in the upper gulf coast area will continue its growth in east texas louisiana and mississippi and plans to test several high potential impact new projects in 2008 

during 2007 eog drilled 55 net wells in the permian basin with 33 net wells drilled in the new mexico wolfcamp play eog has acquired 50000 acres in the play and plans to drill a similar number of wells in 2008 eog also had success with vertical oil wells in the permopenn carbonates as well as horizontal wells in the bone spring sand net production averaged 82 mmcfd of natural gas and 69 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids program economics remained strong through 2007 as significant acreage and new 3d seismic data were acquired in several trends setting up new plays for 2008 and beyond eog holds approximately 450000 net acres in the permian basin

eog continued to expand its activities throughout the rocky mountain area where it holds approximately 13 million net acres during 2007 267 net wells were drilled in the core areas 187 net wells were drilled in the uinta basin utah 38 net wells were drilled in the moxa arch area of wyoming 20 net wells were drilled in the williston basin north dakota and 19 net wells were drilled in the labarge platform wyoming production from the rocky mountain area increased 15 with the increased drilling activity the net average production for 2007 was 178 mmcfd of natural gas and 119 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog expects to continue increasing exploitation drilling activity throughout the rocky mountain area during 2008 while maintaining an active exploration program eog ended 2007 producing approximately 70 mbbld net of crude oil from the bakken play in north dakota and will seek to significantly grow production during 2008 with 49 net wells planned

in the midcontinent area eog drilled 117 net wells during 2007 in the hugotondeep play in the southwest kansasoklahoma panhandle and the cleveland horizontal play in the texas panhandle the net average production for 2007 was 80 mmcfd of natural gas and 35 mbbld of crude oil and condensate which represents a 14 total production increase over 2006 eog continued its strong exploration program in southwest kansas and was successful in finding several new morrow and st louis plays as part of the hugotondeep play eog has eight years remaining on an approximately 900000 gross acre 10year farmin agreement from anadarko petroleum company eog plans to continue exploiting these two core growth areas in 2008 while pursuing other exploration prospects throughout the midcontinent area eog holds approximately 500000 net acres in the midcontinent area

eog had another successful year in south texas and the gulf of mexico drilling 91 net wells in 2007 south texas onshore and gulf of mexico offshore net production averaged 209 mmcfd of natural gas and 78 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids during 2007 the activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio duval and starr counties where eog drilled successful wells in the lobo roleta reklaw frio and wilcox trends eogs application of horizontal drilling and completion technology in the wilcox trend continues to expand into new areas eog is acquiring seismic data and leases to expand horizontal drilling technology to three additional trends in south texas production from two deepwater gulf of mexico wells drilled in the atwater valley area that was discovered in 2001 is expected to commence during the first quarter of 2008 at an initial rate of 10 mmcfd net plans are to increase this rate to approximately 20 mmcfd net after additional facilities are installed 

in mid2008 approximately 92 net wells are planned during 2008 for south texas and the gulf of mexico where eog holds approximately 550000 net acres 

in 2007 eog drilled 51 net wells in the appalachian basin where it holds approximately 310000 net acres net production averaged 17 mmcfd of natural gas and 60 barrels per day of crude oil and condensate a majority of the wells were drilled in the shallow devonian play and 10 gross wells were drilled to evaluate the deeper marcellus shale in december 2007 eog entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the appalachian basin to a subsidiary of exco resources inc an independent oil and gas company for approximately 395 million subject to customary adjustments under the agreement the appalachian area being divested includes approximately 2400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1 of eogs total 2007 production and approximately 2 of its total yearend 2007 proved reserves the transaction closed on february 20 2008 eog retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area including rights in the marcellus shale and will continue its shale exploration program during 2008 eog will continue to drill and evaluate the marcellus shale in pennsylvania using horizontal drilling and completion techniques

as december 31 2007 eog held approximately 3204000 net undeveloped acres in the united states

as eog begins to operate in areas where there is limited infrastructure eog is placing more emphasis on gathering and processing operations to support its production activities this additional emphasis resulted in the formation of pecan pipeline company pecan and pecan pipeline north dakota inc pecan north dakota each a wholly owned subsidiary of eog pecan has installed two natural gas gathering systems in the barnett shale play of north texas and pecan north dakota began the installation of an associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the bakken shale play of north dakota the texas systems total approximately 21 miles of 10 inch and 20 inch diameter lines at yearend 2007 throughput was approximately 27 mmcfd of natural gas additional pipeline and processing facilities are planned for north texas during 2008 initial operation of the north dakota system is expected in the first quarter of 2008 with capacity to gather and process approximately 3 mmcfd of associated natural gas from the bakken oil wells during 2008 an expansion of this system is planned that is expected to increase capacity to approximately 20 mmcfd of associated natural gas

canada eog conducts operations through its subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in calgary alberta during 2007 eogrc continued its successful shallow gas strategy in western canada drilling a total of 731 net wells key producing areas are the southeast albertasouthwest saskatchewan shallow natural gas trends including the drumheller twining and halkirk areas the pembinahighvale area of central alberta the grand prairiewapiti area of northwest alberta and the waskada area in southwest manitoba eogrc drilled one vertical and three horizontal shale gas wells in the horn river basin in northeastern british columbia during 2007 and has plans to drill several additional horizontal shale wells in 2008 details on this play are expected to be released during 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2007 eogrc divested all its exploration properties in the northwest territories as the timeframe for an export pipeline became longer and more problematic a royalty review was undertaken by the alberta government which resulted in a revamping of the royalty structure within alberta effective january 2009 eogrcs analysis determined that these changes will not have a material impact on net after royalty production largely due to the fact that the new royalty structure is favorable to lower productivity shallow gas wells at current pricing eogrcs net production during 2007 averaged 224 mmcfd of natural gas and 35 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eogrc plans to drill at least 600 net wells during 2008 

at december 31 2007 eogrc held approximately 1250000 net undeveloped acres in canada

other international eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

marketing

wellhead marketing eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts based on prevailing market prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the spot market in 2007 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2008 in 2007 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is expected to remain the same in 2008 

substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate is sold under various terms and arrangements based on prevailing market prices

during 2007 no single purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs natural gas and crude oil revenues eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

wellhead volumes and prices 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf crude oil and condensate per barrel bbl and natural gas liquids per bbl the table also presents natural gas equivalent volumes on a thousand cubic feet equivalent basis mcfe  natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 mcf of natural gas to 10 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids delivered during each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007

 1 million cubic feet equivalent per day includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids 2 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable

competition

eog competes for reserve acquisitions and explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions frequently against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources to the extent eogs exploration budget is lower than that of certain of its competitors eog may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves leases licenses and concessions competitive factors include price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies in addition eog faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries please refer to item 1a risk factors

regulation 

united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by state and federal agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and regulate environmental and safety matters 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah new mexico wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior mms approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the mms may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely affect eogs interests

sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales

eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of such facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although 

eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc the state regulatory commissions and the federal and state courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues eog believes that its strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout our operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice eog will continue to review the risks to the company associated with all environmental matters including climate change

canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production  the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and natural gas industry with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to complaints or economic or political conditions the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities could increase eogs costs and may have a material adverse impact on eogs operations and financial condition 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eog operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size however eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted or how such additional legislation or amendments may affect eogs operations and financial condition 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from private lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 

in october 2007 the alberta government announced a new oil and gas royalty framework to take effect in january 2009 the new framework establishes new royalties for conventional oil natural gas and bitumen that are linked to price and production levels and apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects under the new framework the formula for conventional oil and natural gas royalties will be set by a 

sliding rate formula dependant on the market price and production volumes royalty rates for conventional oil will range from 0 to 50 new natural gas royalty rates will range from 5 to 50

the implementation of the new framework is subject to certain risks and uncertainties the significant changes to the royalty regime require new legislation changes to existing legislation and regulation and development of proprietary software to support the calculation and collection of royalties in addition certain proposed changes contemplate further public andor industry consultation accordingly there may be modifications introduced to the new framework prior to its implementation in january 2009

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had to date a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on eogs operations and financial condition 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or may result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations such contamination is not unusual within the crude oil and natural gas industry any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under canadian laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

canada is a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change and has ratified the kyoto protocol established thereunder to set legally binding targets to reduce nationwide emissions of carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and other ghgs in response to the kyoto protocol the canadian federal government introduced the regulatory framework for air emissions regulatory framework for regulating air pollution and industrial ghg emissions by establishing mandatory emissions reduction requirements on a sector basis sectorspecific regulations are expected to come into effect in 2010 and targets would be based on percentages rather than absolute reductions the regulatory framework also proposes a credit emissions trading system additionally regulation can take place at the provincial and municipal level for example alberta introduced the climate change and emissions management act  which provides a framework for managing ghg by reducing specified gas emissions relative to gross domestic product to an amount that is equal to or less than 50 of 1990 levels by december 31 2020 and which imposes duties to report the accompanying regulation the specified gas emitters regulation  which became effective july 1 2007 requires mandatory emissions reductions through the use of emissions intensity targets the direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect eogs business results of operations and financial condition

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad and the united kingdom 

other matters

energy prices since eog is primarily a natural gas producer it is more significantly impacted by changes in prices of natural gas than changes in prices of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in a 3 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price for production in the united states and canada received by eog from 2006 to 2007 a decrease of 15 from 2005 to 2006 and an increase of 37 from 2004 to 2005 in 2007 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2008 in 2007 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is expected to remain the same in 2008 crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated during the last three years due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate natural gas liquids ammonia and methanol prices in the future for additional discussion regarding changes in natural gas and crude oil prices and the risks that such changes may present to eog see item1a risk factors

item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations are subject to many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us

prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely since we are primarily a natural gas company we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are

the level of consumer demand

weather conditions domestic drilling activity the price and availability of alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities worldwide economic and political conditions the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the natural and extent of governmental regulation and taxation including environmental regulations 

our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets and our results of operations

our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially affected if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities moreover we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own and these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons or may not be available to us in the future any significant change in market factors affecting these facilities the availability of these facilities or our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity 

demand for natural gas and crude oil is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce in addition our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and sea level changes associated with climate change which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations maintenance and repairs and the installation of new facilities such extreme weather conditions and changes associated with climate change could materially and adversely affect our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be misstated 

estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes in conditions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated 

to prepare estimates of economically recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced our future natural gas and crude oil production specifically maintaining our production at or increasing our production from current levels is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 

drilling natural gas and crude oil wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs as a result we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations miscalculations or accidents among other factors may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a partial or total loss of our investment in addition we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells as our drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the cost of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including 

unexpected drilling conditions

title problems

pressure or irregularities in formations

equipment failures or accidents

adverse weather conditions

compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements which may increase our costs or restrict our activities

costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs tubular materials and equipment

lack of infrastructure and

lack of trained drilling personnel

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations especially regulations relating to environmental protection and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in foreign countries in which we do business we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations further the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance

as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

eog is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues we are also aware of legislation recently proposed by the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions additionally proposed united states policy legislation or regulatory actions may also address ghg emissions eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities

the exploration for and production of natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities injure or kill people and damage property and the environment moreover our offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for exploration drilling and production and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks

from time to time we use derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on our net income and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges in addition we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver natural gas and crude oil volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed 

if we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties our failure to fully identify potential problems to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

from time to time we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired that we believe are consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements moreover there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual reserves production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates in addition acquisitions may have material and adverse effects on our business and results of operations particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations

terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of natural gas and crude oil leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and the marketing of natural gas and crude oil production higher recent natural gas and crude oil prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are several companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 

in addition many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations we also compete with our competitors in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition development production exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations and commercial paper borrowings and to a lesser extent and if and as necessary bank borrowings and public and private equity and debt offerings 

lower natural gas and crude oil prices however would reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable the recent credit crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage markets and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk generally may increase the interest rates that the lenders require us to pay in addition a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar however certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if the value has not changed in the original currency these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 approximately 15 of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar

 item 2 properties

oil and gas exploration and production  properties and reserves

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based for related discussion see item 1a risk factors

in general production from eogs natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements for related discussion see item 1a risk factors

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

eog resources inc together with its subsidiaries collectively eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada offshore trinidad and the united kingdom north sea eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return drilling internally generated prospects delivering longterm production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet

net income available to common stockholders for 2007 of 1083 million was down 16 compared to 2006 net income available to common stockholders of 1289 million at december 31 2007 eogs total reserves were 77 trillion cubic feet equivalent an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december 31 2006

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2007 

united states and canada eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs natural gas and crude oil production production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately 83 of total company production in 2007 as compared to 79 in 2006 based on current trends eog expects its 2008 production profile to be similar eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico texas utah wyoming and western canada

in december 2007 eog entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the appalachian basin to a subsidiary of exco resources inc an independent oil and gas company for approximately 395 million subject to customary adjustments under the agreement the appalachian area being divested includes approximately 2400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1 of eogs total 2007 production and approximately 2 of its total yearend 2007 proved reserves the transaction closed on february 20 2008 eog retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area including rights in the marcellus shale and will continue its shale exploration program on december 31 2007 the book value of the assets and liabilities included in the sale were 254 million and 9 million respectively

international although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas eog continues to see linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply in trinidad eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts under the atlantic lng train 4 alng contract eog delivered gas at the contractual rate of 30 million cubic feet per day mmcfd gross 12 mmcfd net beginning in may 2007 when the alng plant reached commercial status in march 2007 eog acquired the remaining 10 working interest from primera block 4a limited a trinidadian company and now holds a 100 working interest in block 4a in july 2007 eog executed a 15year natural gas contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc for the sale of approximately 100 mmcfd gross 78 mmcfd net to eog based on current pricing and operating assumptions eog expects to begin initial delivery under this contract in early 2010 from its first discovery on block 4a subject to the completion of a pipeline by ngc

in may 2007 eog acquired the remainder of the interest in the modified ub block from primera oil  gas ltd a trinidadian company and now holds a 100 working interest in the modified ub block in august 2007 eog drilled the ub2 exploratory well on the modified ub block and the well was determined to be noncommercial in 2007 eog agreed to purchase an 80 interest in the pelican field facilities from the subsidiaries of the other participants in the south east coast consortium block the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008

during 2007 eog executed a oneyear term sheet effective july 1 2007 with the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago that sets forth the pricing for the sales of crude oil and condensate produced in trinidad the pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin this term sheet replaces the pricing provisions of a previous crude oil and condensate sales contract 

that expired on june 30 2007 and will be incorporated into a new crude oil and condensate sales contract which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2008 

in addition to eogs ongoing production from the valkyrie and arthur fields in the united kingdom north sea eog participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f at the end of 2006 in 2007 a successful appraisal well was drilled on this prospect the future development of this prospect is currently being evaluated eog also participated in the drilling of an unsuccessful exploratory well in august 2007 on the eos prospect located in the southern north sea block 4511c 

eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group at december 31 2007 eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 14 up from 12 at yearend 2006 by primarily utilizing cash on hand cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from longterm debt borrowings eog funded 39 billion in exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures paid down 158 million of debt paid dividends to common and preferred stockholders of 84 million and paid 51 million for the redemption of preferred stock as management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2008 eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations 

for 2008 eogs budget for exploration and development and other property plant and equipment expenditures is approximately 44 billion excluding acquisitions united states and canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

on september 10 2007 eog completed its public offering of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5875 senior notes due 2017 2017 notes interest on the 2017 notes is payable semiannually on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15 2008 net proceeds from the offering were approximately 595 million and were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities

on september 15 2006 eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s3 new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to 688237500 of eogs debt securities preferred stock andor common stock the new registration statement was filed to replace eogs then existing shelf registration statement which had been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec in october 2000 and under which eog had sold no securities as of december 31 2007 and as a result of the issuance of the 2017 notes eog may offer and sell up to 88237500 of debt securities preferred stock andor common stock under the new registration statement

in 2007 eog repurchased a total of 48260 shares of its outstanding 7195 fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock series b with a 1000 liquidation preference per share series b for an aggregate purchase price including premium and fees of 51 million plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase eog has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the 3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases at december 31 2007 5000 shares of the series b with a book value of 5 million remained outstanding such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in january 2008 see note 3 to consolidated financial statements

stockbased compensation eog adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment effective january 1 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results see note 6 to consolidated financial statements stockbased compensation expense is included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants eog compensation expense related to its stockbased compensation plans for the years ended december 31 was as follows in millions

 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues

during 2007 net operating revenues increased 278 million or 7 to 4191 million from 3913 million in 2006 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids increased 474 million or 13 to 4039 million from 3565 million in 2006 wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 were as follows

 

1 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 2 thousand barrels per day 3 million cubic feet equivalent per day includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 10 barrel of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids

2007 compared to 2006 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2007 increased 248 million or 9 to 3051 million from 2803 million for 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries 278 million partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 30 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to 569 per mcf for 2007 from 574 per mcf in 2006 

natural gas deliveries increased 133 mmcfd or 10 to 1470 mmcfd for 2007 from 1337 mmcfd in 2006 the increase was due to higher production of 154 mmcfd in the united states partially offset by lower production of 12 mmcfd in trinidad 7 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 119 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 13 mmcfd kansas 13 mmcfd and mississippi 10 mmcfd the decline in trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to alng 10 mmcfd and a decrease in contractual demand 2 mmcfd during 2006 eog supplied gas for use in alngs startup phase in 2007 alng remained in the startup phase but did not require any gas from eog until may 2007 when alng reached commercial status and eog began supplying gas under the alng takeorpay contract the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 153 million or 24 to 778 million from 625 million as compared to 2006 due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 81 million and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 72 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in north dakota the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2007 was 6869 per barrel compared to 6238 per barrel for 2006

natural gas liquids revenues increased 73 million or 53 to 210 million from 137 million as compared to 2006 due to increases in deliveries 42 million and the composite average price 31 million the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the fort worth basin barnett shale and south texas areas

during 2007 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 93 million which included realized gains of 128 million during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million 

2006 compared to 2005 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased 136 million or 5 to 2803 million from 2939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 407 million and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract 19 million partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries 290 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13 to 574 per mcf for 2006 from 662 per mcf in 2005 the trinidad takeorpay contract adjustment increased the average trinidad wellhead natural gas price by 023 per mcf for 2005

natural gas deliveries increased 121 mmcfd or 10 to 1337 mmcfd for 2006 from 1216 mmcfd in 2005 the increase was due to higher production of 99 mmcfd in the united states and 33 mmcfd in trinidad partially offset by lower production of 9 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 83 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 24 mmcfd and kansas 7 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production in the gulf of mexico 16 mmcfd the decrease in gulf of mexico production was partially due to continued shutin production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes katrina and rita the increase in trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 43 mmcfd and increased contractual demand 34 mmcfd partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the december 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement 44 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 54 million or 9 to 625 million from 571 million as compared to 2005 due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 78 million partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 24 million the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was 6238 per barrel compared to 5463 per barrel for 2005

natural gas liquids revenues increased 40 million or 41 to 137 million from 97 million as compared to 2005 due to increases in deliveries 24 million and the composite average price 16 million

during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million 

operating and other expenses

2007 compared to 2006  during 2007 operating expenses of 2542 million were 533 million higher than the 2009 million incurred in 2006 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

1 total perunit costs do not include exploration costs dry hole costs impairments and taxes other than income

the primary factors impacting perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga and net interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 are set forth below

lease and well expenses include expenses for eogoperated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time

lease and well expenses of 480 million in 2007 were 107 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 62 million and canada 13 million higher lease and well administrative expenses 18 million higher workover expenditures in the united states 7 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate 7 million

transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from thirdparty carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs and transportation fees

transportation costs of 170 million in 2007 were 60 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 

dda expenses of 1066 million in 2007 were 248 million higher than 2006 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 122 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 5 million dda rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 102 million canada 17 million and in the united kingdom 2 million the exchange rates in canada 10 million and in the united kingdom 2 million also contributed to the dda expense increase

ga expenses of 205 million in 2007 were 40 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 24 million legal settlement costs 4 million insurance costs 3 million and office rent 2 million the increase in employeerelated costs primarily reflects higher stockbased compensation expenses 11 million

net interest expense of 47 million in 2007 increased 4 million compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher average debt balance 13 million partially offset by higher capitalized interest 9 million

exploration costs of 150 million in 2007 were 5 million lower than 2006 due primarily to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states

impairments include amortization of unproved leases as well as impairments under sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of longlived assets based on future cash flow analysis impairments of 148 million in 2007 were 39 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased sfas no 144 related impairments 27 million and increased amortization of unproved leases in the united states 7 million the united kingdom 3 million and canada 3 million the increase in sfas no 144 related impairments is due to an increase in canada 15 million primarily related to the northwest territories discovery see note 15 to consolidated financial statements and an increase in the united states 12 million under sfas no 144 eog recorded impairments of 82 million and 55 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes severanceproduction taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valoremproperty taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets taxes other than income in 2007 increased 7 million to 208 million 52 of wellhead revenues from 201 million 56 of wellhead revenues in 2006

severanceproduction taxes increased primarily due to increased wellhead revenues in the united states 27 million and trinidad 2 million partially offset by increased credits taken for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 26 million ad valoremproperty taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in canada 2 million

other income net was 29 million in 2007 compared to 52 million in 2006 the decrease of 23 million was primarily due to lower interest income 17 million lower settlements received related to the enron corp bankruptcy 3 million and lower equity income from the nitrogen 2000 unlimited ammonia plant 2 million

income tax provision of 541 million in 2007 decreased 72 million compared to 2006 due primarily to decreased pretax income 99 million partially offset by higher foreign income taxes 10 million and increased state income taxes 7 million the net effective tax rate for 2007 increased to 33 from 32 in 2006

2006 compared to 2005  during 2006 operating expenses of 2009 million were 381 million higher than the 1628 million incurred in 2005 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

1 total perunit costs do not include exploration costs dry hole costs impairments and taxes other than income

transportation costs of 110 million in 2006 were 23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play

dda expenses of 817 million in 2006 were 163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 56 million and trinidad 3 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 4 million dda rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 78 million and canada 11 million and a downward reserve revision in the united kingdom 11 million the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dda expense increase 9 million

ga expenses of 165 million in 2006 were 39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 31 million and higher insurance costs 4 million the increase in employeerelated costs primarily reflects higher stockbased compensation expenses 17 million

net interest expense of 43 million in 2006 decreased 19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to a lower average debt balance 9 million costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 600 notes due 2008 8 million and higher capitalized interest 5 million

exploration costs of 155 million in 2006 were 22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expenses

taxes other than income of 201 million in 2006 were 2 million higher than 2005 severance taxes in the united states decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 14 million severanceproduction taxes in trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate 12 million partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the supplemental petroleum tax 7 million ad valoremproperty taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states 7 million and canada 2 million

other income net was 52 million in 2006 compared to 23 million in 2005 the increase of 29 million was primarily due to higher interest income 19 million settlements received related to the enron corp bankruptcy 4 million and increased net foreign currency transaction gains 3 million

income tax provision of 613 million in 2006 decreased 93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes 37 million largely related to a canadian federal tax rate reduction 19 million and an alberta canada corporate tax rate reduction 13 million partially offset by a united kingdom corporate tax rate increase 7 million reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 24 million decreased pretax income 18 million and reduced state income taxes 18 million partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction 7 million the effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32 from 36 in 2005

capital resources and liquidity

cash flow

exploration and development expenditures of 3568 million for 2007 were 663 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of 573 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 648 million increased lease acquisitions in the united states 57 million increased dry hole costs in the united states 19 million trinidad 9 million and the united kingdom 7 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 18 million and increased capitalized interest in the united states 8 million these increases were partially offset by lower drilling and facilities expenditures in canada 70 million the united kingdom 12 million and trinidad 7 million decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 7 million and decreased lease acquisitions in the united kingdom 6 million the 2007 exploration and development expenditures of 3568 million includes 2681 million in development 838 million in exploration 29 million in capitalized interest and 20 million in property acquisitions the increase in expenditures for other property plant and equipment primarily related to gathering systems and processing plants in the fort worth basin barnett shale and rocky mountain areas the 2006 exploration and development expenditures of 2905 million includes 2159 million in development 704 million in exploration 22 million in property acquisitions and 20 million in capitalized interest the 2005 exploration and development expenditures of 1818 million includes 1260 million in development 487 million in exploration 56 million in property acquisitions and 15 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and the united kingdom north sea such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

derivative transactions

during 2007 eog recognized net gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 93 million which included realized gains of 128 million during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 14 at december 31 2007 compared to 12 at december 31 2006 

during 2007 total debt increased 452 million to 1185 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 1227 million and 754 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2007 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in an 83 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2007 and 2006 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings to fund its capital programs while eog maintains a 10 billion commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2007 was 590 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted 

credit facilities during 2007 was 123 million with no amounts outstanding at yearend eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 10 billion revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements combined with approximately 88 million of availability under its shelf registration described below to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

during september 2007 eog issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of its 2017 notes net proceeds of approximately 595 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities in december 2007 eog repaid at maturity the remaining 98 million principal amount of its 650 notes due in 2007 also during 2007 a foreign subsidiary of eog repaid the remaining 60 million yearend 2006 outstanding balance of its 600 million 3year unsecured senior term loan agreement eog had previously terminated its remaining borrowing capacity under the senior term loan agreement

in 2007 eog repurchased a total of 48260 shares of its outstanding series b for an aggregate purchase price including premium and fees of 51 million plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase eog has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the 3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases at december 31 2007 5000 shares of the series b with a book value of 5 million remained outstanding such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in january 2008

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2007 in thousands

 1 this table does not include the liability for dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties in addition this table does not include eogs pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note 6 to consolidated financial statements 2 amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31 2007 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 3 amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities or partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangement as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk during any of the periods in this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2007 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad and the united kingdom the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2007 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2007 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 under those provisions as of december 31 2007 eog recorded the fair value of the swap of 58 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of 8 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook 

pricing natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels such as oil and coal the market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate in 2008 will impact the level of eogs 2008 total capital expenditures as well as its production

including the impact of eogs 2008 natural gas and crude oil hedges based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2008 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 20 million for net income and operating cash flow eogs price sensitivity in 2008 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price combined with the related change in natural gas liquids prices is approximately 10 million for net income and operating cash flow for information regarding eogs natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of december 31 2007 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

capital eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada in 2008 eog expects to allocate an increased amount of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the fort worth basin barnett shale and the rocky mountain operating area which includes the uinta basin and the north dakota bakken in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio eog anticipates continuing to expend a portion of its available funds in the further development of trinidad and the united kingdom north sea in addition eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitationtype opportunities budgeted 2008 exploration and development expenditures excluding acquisitions are approximately 41 billion in addition budgeted 2008 expenditures for natural gas gathering and processing and other assets are approximately 280 million the total 2008 capital expenditures budget of 44 billion excluding acquisitions is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow

the level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2008 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors based upon existing economic and market conditions eog believes net operating cash flow proceeds from asset sales and available financing alternatives in 2008 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year however eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration exploitation development and acquisition 

expenditure plans if circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and the united kingdom such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

operations based on average north american natural gas prices of 750 per mcf at henry hub and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of 41 billion excluding acquisitions eog expects to increase overall production in 2008 by 15 over 2007 levels united states production is expected to increase by 19 with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 36 and 40 respectively 

environmental regulations

various foreign federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues we are also aware of legislation recently proposed by the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions additionally proposed united states policy legislation or regulatory actions may also address ghg emissions eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies legislation or regulations in the areas where we are operating to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions where necessary 

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

oil and gas exploration costs

eog accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2007 and 2006 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 15 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized 

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is recognized unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical experience is amortized over the average holding period if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depreciation depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis 

assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas no 19 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor property dispositions and 4 impairments 

stockbased compensation

effective january 1 2006 eog accounts for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r share based payment in applying the provisions of sfas 123r judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of riskfree interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

 item 1 business

general

eog resources inc eog a delaware corporation organized in 1985 together with its subsidiaries explores for develops produces and markets natural gas and crude oil primarily in major producing basins in the united states of america united states canada offshore trinidad the united kingdom north sea and from time to time select other international areas eogs principal producing areas are further described in exploration and production below eogs annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through its website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with the securities and exchange commission sec eogs website address is httpwwweogresourcescom 

at december 31 2006 eogs total estimated net proved reserves were 6802 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe of which 6095 billion cubic feet bcf were natural gas reserves and 118 million barrels mmbbl or 707 bcfe were crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids reserves see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements at such date approximately 60 of eogs reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were located in the united states 20 in canada and 20 in trinidad as of december 31 2006 eog employed approximately 1570 persons including foreign national employees

eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis eog focuses its drilling activity toward natural gas deliverability in addition to natural gas reserve replacement and to a lesser extent crude oil exploration and exploitation eog focuses on the costeffective utilization of advances in technology associated with the gathering processing and interpretation of threedimensional 3d seismic data the development of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives and formation logging techniques and reservoir fracturing methods these advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration development and exploitation eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves eog also makes select tactical acquisitions that result in additional economies of scale or land positions with significant additional prospects maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy

with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by eogs working interest in the wells or acreage 

business segments

eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil exploration and production related

exploration and production

united states and canada operations

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada 

at december 31 2006 88 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and 12 were crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through application of new processes and technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2006 and certain 2007 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states during 2006 eog substantially increased drilling activity acreage position reserve potential and production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play fort worth barnett the net average production from the fort worth barnett for 2006 was 145 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas and 300 barrels per day bbld 

of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog drilled 205 net fort worth barnett wells during 2006 and grew production to over 200 mmcfd net by yearend 2006 during the year eog leased more than 100000 additional net acres and increased eogs total leasehold to greater than 600000 net acres eog will substantially increase drilling activity in the forth worth barnett during 2007 with plans to drill approximately 380 gross wells and exit the year with over 300 mmcfd net production eog continues to generate new opportunities in the fort worth barnett which eog expects will add significant future reserve and production potential

the upper gulf coast continued to be a growth area for eog where 2006 net production averaged 117 mmcfd of natural gas and 35 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog drilled 60 net wells with 30 net wells in the cotton valley and travis peak development programs at the sligo minden carthage and appleby fields north louisiana development activity included five net wells at driscoll mountain in the expanded cotton valley and 10 horizontal producers in spider field eog continues its growth in mississippi where 13 successful net wells were drilled in 2006 in the hosston play in south williamsburg eog is currently one of the largest natural gas producers in mississippi eog will continue its growth in east texas louisiana and mississippi with tests of several high potential impact new projects in 2007

in the permian basin eog drilled 30 net horizontal gas wells in 2006 in the new mexico wolfcamp play eog has over 40000 net acres in the play and plans to drill approximately 33 net wells in 2007 eog has identified approximately 100 drilling locations in this play significant drilling and completion improvements have resulted in cost reductions as well as quick spudtosales cycle times for these wells this activity was complemented by a number of successful wells in the permopenn carbonate bone spring carbonate and horizontal bone spring eog drilled 61 net wells in 2006 and net production averaged 87 mmcfd of natural gas and 71 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids several additional horizontal plays which could set up multiple drilling locations will be tested in 2007 on over 20000 acres controlled by eog 

eog increased drilling activity within its core areas of the rocky mountain area drilling 179 net wells during 2006 including 84 net wells in the uinta basin utah 40 net wells in the labarge platform wyoming 34 net wells in the moxa arch area wyoming and seven net wells in the williston basin the net average daily production for 2006 from the rocky mountain area was 165 mmcfd of natural gas and 86 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog expects to continue increasing drilling activity in these core areas during 2007 while maintaining an active exploration and delineation program in other areas in utah wyoming and north dakota

in the midcontinent area eog drilled 117 net wells in its core areas in 2006 most notably the hugotondeep play in the oklahoma panhandle and the cleveland horizontal play in the texas panhandle the net average production for 2006 was 74 mmcfd of natural gas and 24 mbbld of crude oil and condensate in the hugotondeep play eog shifted its prospecting into southwest kansas and was successful in finding several new morrow plays net production from this area increased from 25 mmcfd in the beginning of 2006 to over 50 mmcfd by yearend nine years remain on the 900000 acre 10year joint venture with anadarko petroleum company in the cleveland horizontal play eog drilled 28 net wells in 2006 bringing its total to 125 net wells drilled since 2003 eog plans to continue exploiting these two core growth areas in 2007 while pursuing other exploration prospects throughout the midcontinent area

eog had another successful year in south texas drilling 84 net wells in 2006 south texas onshore net production averaged 185 mmcfd of natural gas and 63 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids during 2006 the activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio duval and starr counties where eog drilled successful wells in the lobo roleta reklaw frio and wilcox trends eogs application of horizontal drilling and completion technology in the wilcox trend has resulted in new opportunities for this mature play eog added significant lease positions and 3d seismic in 2006 to sustain a longterm drilling program

during 2006 eog participated in two discoveries in the gulf of mexico in the high island area one well is producing and another well is expected to be on sales during the first quarter of 2007 a development well is currently being drilled in high island block 130 and is expected to be completed by march 2007 net production from these three wells is expected to be 10 mmcfd by mid2007 drilling and completion operations for a deepwater project are underway and first production is projected for early 2008 at least two additional exploratory projects are planned for the gulf of mexico in 2007

in 2006 eog drilled 68 net wells in the appalachian basin net production averaged 19 mmcfd of natural gas and 60 bbld of crude oil and condensate eog is planning a similar drilling program in 2007 the majority of the wells will be drilled in the shallow devonian and 10 net wells are planned for the marcellus shale the marcellus wells will be drilled in pennsylvania to evaluate eogs acreage in the joint venture with seneca resources corporation

at december 31 2006 eog held approximately 3184000 net undeveloped acres in the united states 

canada  in canada eog conducts operations through its subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in calgary alberta during 2006 eogrc continued its successful shallow gas strategy in western canada drilling a total of 1330 net wells the 2006 shallow natural gas drilling program included 128 net horseshoe canyon coalbed methane wells eogrc participated in two exploratory wells in the northwest territories in 2006 resulting in a new pool discovery and a confirmation of an existing discovery made in 2004 eogrcs net production during 2006 averaged 226 mmcfd of natural gas and 33 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids key producing areas are the southeast albertasouthwest saskatchewan shallow natural gas trends including the drumheller twining and halkirk areas the pembinahighvale area of central alberta the grand prairiewapiti area of northwest alberta and the waskada area in southwest manitoba eogrc plans to drill approximately 1000 net wells in these areas during 2007

other international eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

marketing

wellhead marketing eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts at marketresponsive prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the spot market in 2006 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2007 in 2006 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is expected to remain the same in 2007 

substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate is sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive prices

during 2006 sales to a major integrated oil and gas company with investment grade credit ratings accounted for 11 of eogs oil and gas revenues no other individual purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs oil and gas revenues for the same period eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

wellhead volumes and prices

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf crude oil and condensate per barrel bbl and natural gas liquids per bbl the table also presents natural gas equivalent volumes on a thousand cubic feet equivalent basis mcfe  natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 mcf of natural gas to 10 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids delivered during each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006

 1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 million cubic feet equivalent per day includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids 3 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 4 includes 023 per mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract

competition

eog competes for reserve acquisitions and explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions frequently against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources to the extent eogs exploration budget is lower than that of certain of its competitors eog may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves leases licenses and concessions competitive factors include price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies in addition eog faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries please refer to item 1a risk factors beginning on page 13

regulation

united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by state and federal agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and regulate environmental and safety matters 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior mms approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the mms may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely affect eogs interests

sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales

eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc the state regulatory commissions and the federal and state courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

eog is aware of the increasing focus of local national and international regulatory bodies on gaseous emissions and climate change eog believes that its strategy to reduce emissions throughout our operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice eog will continue to review the risks to the company associated with all environmental matters including global warmingclimate change

canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production  the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and natural gas industry with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to complaints or economic or political conditions the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities increase eogs costs and may have a material adverse impact on its operations 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eog operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from private lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment while compliance with such 

legislation can require significant expenditures failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative civil or criminal penalties suspension or revocation of licenses and in some instances the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations such contamination is not unusual within the crude oil and natural gas industry any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

in december 2002 the canadian federal government ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change which requires canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 below 1990 levels over the 20082012 periods the climate change plan for canada  which was released in november 2002 outlined in very general terms the approach the canadian government intended to take to implement its emissions reduction commitment the canadian government issued a further climate change plan moving forward on climate change a plan for honouring our kyoto commitment  in april of 2005 with the change in government at the federal level since the issuance of the 2005 plan it is unclear how canada intends to meet its kyoto protocol obligations the final rules once known could affect operations and profitability 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad and the united kingdom 

other matters

energy prices since eog is primarily a natural gas producer it is more significantly impacted by changes in prices of natural gas than changes in prices of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in a 12 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price for production in the united states and canada received by eog from 2003 to 2004 an increase of 37 from 2004 to 2005 and a decrease of 15 from 2005 to 2006 in 2006 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts in trinidad will remain the same in 2007 in 2006 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from the united kingdom were sold on the spot market the remaining volumes were sold by means of forward contracts the marketing strategy for the wellhead natural gas volumes in the united kingdom is expected to remain the same in 2007 crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated during the last three years due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate ammonia and methanol prices in the future

assuming a totally unhedged position for 2007 based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2007 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 27 million for net income and operating cash flow eogs price sensitivity in 2007 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price is approximately 6 million for net income and operating cash flow summarized below and in note 11 to consolidated financial statements is information regarding eogs current 2007 natural gas and crude oil hedge position 

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily collar and price swap contracts as the means tomanage this price risk eog accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the marktomarket accounting method in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the 

financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices for a summary of eogs financial commodity derivative contracts see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  derivative transactions 

all of eogs natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil including blowouts cratering and fires each of which could result in damage to life andor property offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions eogs activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations in accordance with customary industry practices insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of the risks losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 

eogs operations outside of the united states are subject to certain risks including expropriation of assets risks of increases in taxes and government royalties renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments political instability payment delays limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses as well as changes in laws regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies please refer to item 1a risk factors beginning on page 13 for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject

texas severance tax rate reduction natural gas production from qualifying texas wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production however the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a wellbywell basis for the impact on eog see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  taxes other than income taxes

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or financial results if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us

prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely since we are primarily a natural gas company we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are

the level of consumer demand weather conditions domestic drilling activity the price and availability of alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities worldwide economic and political conditions the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets

our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities or our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons or may not be available to us in the future 

weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity 

demand for natural gas and oil is to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce in addition our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 

reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be misstated 

estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

to prepare estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs actual results most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future crude oil and natural gas production is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment in addition we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells further our drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including 

unexpected drilling conditions title problems pressure or irregularities in formations equipment failures or accidents adverse weather conditions compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements which may increase our costs or restrict our activities costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs tubular materials and equipment lack of infrastructure and lack of trained drilling personnel we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations especially regulations relating to environmental protection and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by other governmentsauthorities in countries in which we do business we have and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations further the crude oil and natural gas industry regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could hurt our business

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities

the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities injure or kill people and damage property and the environment offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce our revenues and increase our costs to the extent not covered by insurance

the occurrence of any of these events and any costs incurred as a result of such events and the liabilities related thereto would reduce the funds available for exploration drilling and production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks

from time to time we use derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on net income and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges in addition we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations particularly where 

transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed 

if we acquire oil and gas properties our failure to fully identify potential problems to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could seriously harm us

from time to time we seek to acquire oil and gas properties although we perform reviews of acquired properties that we believe are consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 

in addition acquisitions may have adverse effects on our operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations

terrorist activities and military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as the military or other actions taken in response to these acts cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these actions could adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terror 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and the marketing of crude oil and natural gas production higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 

many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas production such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition development production exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations commercial paper and to a lesser extent and if necessary bank borrowings public and private equity and debt offerings lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would 

reduce our cash flow further if the condition of the capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable in addition a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based

in general production from eogs oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

eog resources inc eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada offshore trinidad and the united kingdom north sea eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return drilling internally generated prospects delivering longterm production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet

net income available to common for 2006 of 1289 million was up 3 compared to 2005 net income available to common of 1252 million at december 31 2006 eogs total reserves were 68 trillion cubic feet equivalent an increase of 607 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december 31 2005

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2006 

united states and canada eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and natural gas production production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately 79 of total company production in both 2006 and 2005 based on current trends eog expects its 2007 production profile to be similar eogs major producing areas are in louisiana new mexico oklahoma texas utah wyoming and western canada

international although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas eog sees an increasing linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply for example liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing and planned facilities in trinidad are contenders to meet increasing united states natural gas demand in addition ammonia methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the united states and canada to trinidad driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation eog believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to two ammonia plants a methanol plant and the atlantic lng train 4 alng plant will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada natural gas fundamentals

beginning december 2005 alng began taking startup gas and remained in the startup phase through december 2006 in the first quarter of 2006 a subsidiary of eog eog resources trinidad block 4a unlimited drilled two successful wells on block 4a the subsidiary obtained approval to develop block 4a under a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago signed in july 2005

a subsidiary of eog eog resources trinidad limited and the other participants in the south east coast consortium secc block signed a farmout agreement covering the secc deep ibis prospect with bp trinidad and tobago llc bp during 2004 the secc deep ibis well spud in april 2006 was drilled to a depth of approximately 19000 feet and was abandoned and classified as a dry hole in the third quarter of 2006 bp paid the entire cost for drilling the secc deep ibis exploratory well 

during 2006 notwithstanding difficulties in accessing rig slots in the southern gas basin of the united kingdom north sea arthur 3 was drilled and completed and began producing in early third quarter in addition to eogs ongoing production from valkyrie and arthur fields eog participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block 2316f the columbus well was a farmin opportunity and its future appraisal and development is currently being evaluated

capital structure

one of managements key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio as compared to those in eogs peer group at december 31 2006 eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 12 down from 19 at yearend 2005 by primarily utilizing cash on hand and cash provided from its operating activities eog funded its 2974 million exploration and development expenditures paid down 317 million of debt paid dividends to common shareholders of 60 million and redeemed 47 million of preferred stock as management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2007 eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations 

for 2007 eogs estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately 34 billion excluding acquisitions united states and canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

on september 15 2006 eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s3 new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to 688237500 of eogs debt securities preferred stock and common stock the new registration statement was filed to replace eogs existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec in october 2000 under which eog had sold no securities as of february 26 2007 the entire amount registered remains available under the new registration statement

on october 11 2006 eog commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100000 outstanding shares of the 7195 fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock series b with a 1000 liquidation preference per share series b at a price of 107401 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase the tender offer expired on november 8 2006 and on november 10 2006 eog redeemed 46740 shares of the series b for an aggregate purchase price including redemption premium fees and dividends of 51 million eog has included as a component of preferred dividends the 4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the series b shares a total of 53260 shares of the series b remain outstanding at december 31 2006

stockbased compensation eog adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment effective january 1 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results see note 6 to consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r eog recognized compensation expense for its stockbased compensation plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees stockbased compensation expense prior to january 1 2006 consisted of amounts recognized in connection with grants of restricted stock and units the adoption of sfas no 123r resulted in eog recognizing compensation expense on grants made under its employee stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan for periods subsequent to january 1 2006 stockbased compensation expense is included in the consolidated statements of income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 eog compensation expense related to its stockbased compensation plans was as follows in millions

 

results of operations 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1 

net operating revenues

during 2006 net operating revenues increased 284 million or 8 to 3904 million from 3620 million in 2005 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids decreased 42 million or 1 to 3565 million from 3607 million in 2005 wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 were as follows

 

1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 3 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 10 barrel of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids 4 includes 023 per mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract

2006 compared to 2005 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased 136 million or 5 to 2803 million from 2939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price 407 million and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract 19 million partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries 290 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13 to 574 per mcf for 2006 from 662 per mcf in 2005 the trinidad takeorpay contract adjustment increased the average trinidad wellhead natural gas price by 023 per mcf for 2005

natural gas deliveries increased 121 mmcfd or 10 to 1337 mmcfd for 2006 from 1216 mmcfd in 2005 the increase was due to higher production of 99 mmcfd in the united states and 33 mmcfd in trinidad partially offset by lower production of 9 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 2 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 83 mmcfd the rocky mountain area 24 mmcfd and kansas 7 mmcfd partially offset by decreased production in the gulf of mexico 16 mmcfd the decrease in gulf of mexico production was partially due to continued shutin production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes katrina and rita the increase in trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 43 mmcfd and increased contractual demand 34 mmcfd partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the december 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement 44 mmcfd the decrease in production in the united kingdom was a result of production declines in both the arthur and valkyrie fields 

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 54 million or 9 to 625 million from 571 million as compared to 2005 due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 78 million partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 24 million the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was 6238 per barrel compared to 5463 per barrel for 2005

natural gas liquids revenues increased 40 million or 41 to 137 million from 97 million as compared to 2005 due to increases in deliveries 24 million and the composite average price 16 million

during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million 

2005 compared to 2004 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased 1097 million or 60 to 2939 million from 1842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 763 million increased natural gas deliveries 315 million and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract 19 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36 to 662 per mcf for 2005 from 486 per mcf in 2004 excluding the aforementioned adjustment the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35 to 658 per mcf for 2005 this adjustment increased the average trinidad wellhead natural gas price by 023 per mcf for 2005

natural gas deliveries increased 180 mmcfd or 17 to 1216 mmcfd for 2005 from 1036 mmcfd in 2004 the increase was due to higher production of 87 mmcfd in the united states 45 mmcfd in trinidad 32 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 16 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 63 mmcfd and louisiana 20 mmcfd the increase in trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants the increase in the united kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the arthur field in january 2005 24 mmcfd and the full year production from the valkyrie field which commenced production in august 2004 8 mmcfd the increase in canada was attributable to the drilling program primarily in the wapiti drumheller and connorsville areas

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 168 million or 42 to 571 million from 403 million as compared to 2004 due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 151 million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 17 million the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was 5463 per barrel compared to 4022 per barrel for 2004

natural gas liquids revenues increased 42 million or 76 to 97 million from 55 million as compared to 2004 due to increases in the composite average price 23 million and deliveries 19 million

during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million during 2004 eog recognized losses on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 33 million which included realized losses of 82 million and collar premium payments of 1 million 

operating and other expenses

2006 compared to 2005  during 2006 operating expenses of 2009 million were 381 million higher than the 1628 million incurred in 2005 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

1 total perunit costs do not include exploration costs dry hole costs and impairments

the change in perunit rates of lease and well transportation costs dda ga taxes other than income and net interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below

lease and well expenses include expenses for eog operated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other things pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep and fuel and power workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time

lease and well expenses of 373 million in 2006 were 86 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 34 million and canada 16 million higher lease and well administrative expenses 21 million including stockbased compensation expense 10 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million and higher workover expenditures in the united states 6 million

transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from thirdparty carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale transportation costs include the cost of compression compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements dehydration removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements gathering fees fuel costs and transportation fees 

transportation costs of 110 million in 2006 were 23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact eogs composite dda rate and expense such as field production profiles drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 

dda expenses of 817 million in 2006 were 163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states 56 million and trinidad 3 million partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom 4 million dda rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states 78 million and canada 11 million and a downward reserve revision in the united kingdom 11 million the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dda expense increase 9 million

ga expenses of 165 million in 2006 were 39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs 31 million and higher insurance costs 4 million the increase in employeerelated costs primarily reflects higher stockbased compensation expenses 17 million

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes taxes other than income of 201 million in 2006 were 2 million higher than 2005

severance taxes in the united states decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 14 million severanceproduction taxes in trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate 12 million partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the supplemental petroleum tax 7 million ad valoremproperty taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states 7 million and canada 2 million

net interest expense of 43 million in 2006 decreased 19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average debt balance 9 million costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 600 notes due 2008 8 million and higher capitalized interest 5 million

exploration costs of 155 million in 2006 were 22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expenses

impairments include amortization of unproved leases as well as impairments under sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of longlived assets based on future cash flow analysis impairments of 108 million in 2006 were 30 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased sfas no 144 related impairments in the united states 17 million and canada 7 million and higher amortization of unproved leases in canada 4 million and the united states 2 million eog recorded impairments of 55 million and 31 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively under sfas no 144 for properties in the united states and canada

other income net was 60 million in 2006 compared to 36 million in 2005 the increase of 24 million was primarily due to higher interest income 19 million settlements received related to the enron corp bankruptcy 4 million and increased net foreign currency transaction gains 3 million partially offset by lower gains on sales of properties 5 million

income tax provision of 613 million in 2006 decreased 93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes 37 million largely related to a canadian federal tax rate reduction 19 million and an alberta canada corporate tax rate reduction 13 million partially offset by a united kingdom corporate tax rate increase 7 million reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 24 million decreased pretax income 18 million and reduced state income taxes 18 million partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction 7 million the effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32 from 36 in 2005

2005 compared to 2004  during 2005 operating expenses of 1628 million were 336 million higher than the 1292 million incurred in 2004 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

1 total perunit costs do not include exploration costs dry hole costs and impairments

the perunit rates of lease and well including transportation dda taxes other than income and interest expense net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below

lease and well expenses including transportation of 373 million were 102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 40 million increased transportation related costs in the united states 28 million and the united kingdom 7 million higher lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 11 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million and higher workover expenditures in the united states 3 million and trinidad 2 million

dda expenses of 654 million in 2005 were 150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the united states 46 million canada 6 million and trinidad 5 million and the commencement of production in the united kingdom 14 million dda rates increased in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties 59 million and in canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves 9 million the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dda expense increase 8 million

taxes other than income of 199 million in 2005 were 65 million higher than 2004 severanceproduction taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the united states 41 million trinidad 7 million and canada 3 million partially offset by the increase in credits taken for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions 10 million and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 5 million other items contributing to the increase were an additional trinidadian supplemental petroleum tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to january 2004 7 million and 2004 production tax relief in trinidad 6 million ad valoremproperty taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states 11 million 

net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of the 2008 notes 8 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements excluding these early retirement costs the 2005 net interest expense decreased 8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest 5 million an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 2 million and lower average debt balance in the united states 1 million

exploration costs of 133 million in 2005 were 39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the fort worth basin barnett shale play

impairments of 78 million were 4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the united states 12 million and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain longlived assets in canada 8 million partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain longlived assets in the united states 14 million and higher amortization of unproved leases in canada 2 million eog recorded impairments of 31 million and 25 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively under sfas no 144 for certain properties in the united states and canada

other income net of 36 million in 2005 increased 26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties 7 million interest income 6 million and equity income from investments in the caribbean nitrogen company limited cncl and nitrogen 2000 unlimited n2000 ammonia plants in 2005 

5 million decreased net foreign currency transaction losses 4 million and a gain on the sale of part of eogs interest in the n2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 2 million

income tax provision of 706 million increased 404 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to higher pretax income 383 million and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 24 million the effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36 from 33 in 2004 

capital resources and liquidity

the primary sources of cash for eog during the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 included funds generated from operations funds from new borrowings proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan and proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations exploration and development expenditures repayment of debt dividend payments to shareholders and redemption of preferred stock

2006 compared to 2005 net cash provided by operating activities of 2579 million in 2006 increased 209 million compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts 205 million favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities 162 million and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest expense 54 million partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses 173 million and a decrease in wellhead revenues 42 million

net cash used in investing activities of 2710 million in 2006 increased by 1032 million compared to 2005 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties 1094 million and decreased proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties 51 million partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities 125 million changes in components of working capital associated with investing activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities

total exploration and development expenditures

the table below sets out components of total exploration and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 along with the total budgeted for 2007 excluding acquisitions in millions

 

exploration and development expenditures of 2974 million for 2006 were 1116 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of 1014 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 843 million trinidad 79 million canada 57 million and the united kingdom 13 million increased lease acquisitions in the united states 74 million and canada 16 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate 28 million the 2006 exploration and development expenditures of 2974 million includes 2228 million in development 704 million in exploration 22 million in property acquisitions and 20 million in capitalized interest the 2005 exploration and development expenditures of 1858 million includes 1300 million in development 487 million in exploration 56 million in property acquisitions and 15 million in capitalized interest the 2004 exploration and development expenditures of 1511 million includes 1009 million in development 440 million in exploration 52 million in property acquisitions and 10 million in capitalized interest 

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and the united kingdom such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

derivative transactions

during 2006 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 334 million which included realized gains of 215 million during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 12 as of december 31 2006 compared to 19 as of december 31 2005 

during 2006 total debt decreased 252 million to 733 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 754 million and 1025 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2006 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in a 39 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2006 and 2005 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations while eog maintains a 600 million commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2006 was 172 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 600 million revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements combined with approximately 688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

during 2006 eog repaid the 126 million 670 notes due in 2006 primarily with cash generated from operating activities in 2006 a foreign subsidiary of eog repaid 190 million of the 250 million borrowed in 2005 see note 2 to consolidated financial statements the foreign subsidiary has the option to pay off the remaining 60 million of the 250 million borrowed in 2005 at any time prior to maturity eog plans to replace the 98 million 650 notes due 2007 with other longterm debt

on october 11 2006 eog commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100000 outstanding shares of the 7195 fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock series b with a 1000 liquidation preference per share series b at a price of 107401 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase the tender offer expired on november 8 2006 and on november 10 2006 eog redeemed 46740 shares of the series b for an aggregate purchase price including redemption premium fees and dividends of 

51 million eog has included as a component of preferred dividends the 4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the series b shares a total of 53260 shares of the series b remain outstanding at december 31 2006

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2006 in thousands

 

1 this table does not include the liability for dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties in addition this table does not include eogs pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note 6 to consolidated financial statements 2 amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31 2006 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 3 amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 

shelf registration

on september 15 2006 eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s3 new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to 688237500 of eogs debt securities preferred stock and common stock the new registration statement was filed to replace eogs existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec in october 2000 under which eog had sold no securities as of february 26 2007 the entire amount registered remains available under the new registration statement

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other offbalance sheet arrangements during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions or arrangements in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2006 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad and the united kingdom the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2006 was the canadian dollar the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2006 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 under those provisions as of december 31 2006 eog recorded the fair value of the swap of 36 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook

natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels such as oil and coal

assuming a totally unhedged position for 2007 based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2007 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 27 million for net income and operating cash flow eogs price sensitivity in 2007 for each 100 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price is approximately 6 million for net income and operating cash flow for information regarding eogs natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of december 31 2006 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada however in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north sea eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the united states and canada in addition eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities budgeted 2007 exploration and development expenditures excluding acquisitions are approximately 34 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding its exploration development exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow

the level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2007 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors based upon existing economic and market conditions eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2007 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year however eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration exploitation development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and the united kingdom such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

environmental regulations

various foreign federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such 

laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

oil and gas exploration costs

oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made as of december 31 2006 and 2005 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 15 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized 

impairments

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is recognized unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical experience is amortized over the average holding period if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future 

undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depletion depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis 

assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas no 19 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor property dispositions and 4 impairments 

stockbased compensation

effective january 1 2006 eog accounts for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r share based payment sfas no 123r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award eliminating the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees in applying the provisions of sfas 123r judgments and estimates are made regarding among other things the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies assumptions regarding expected volatility of eogs common stock the level of risk free interest rates expected dividend yields on eogs stock the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

exploration and production

united states and canada operations

eogs operations are focused on most of the productive basins in the united states and canada 

at december 31 2005 88 of eogs net proved united states and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and 12 were crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids substantial portions of these reserves are in longlived fields with wellestablished production characteristics eog believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through application of new processes and technologies eog also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends to its broad portfolio the following is a summary of significant developments during 2005 and certain 2006 plans for eogs united states and canada operations 

united states during 2005 eog continued its success in the prolific barnett shale play in north texas with excellent drilling results plus significant growth in production and an increased acreage position eog drilled 88 net horizontal wells and grew production to approximately 100 million cubic feet per day mmcfd net by yearend eog made several significant gas discoveries extending the trend to the west of fort worth eog increased its acreage position in the barnett shale play to over 500000 acres during 2005 and may add acreage in this prolific play during 2006 eog had 12 drilling rigs operating at yearend 2005 and plans to increase the number of rigs throughout 2006 eog plans to drill approximately 210 gross barnett shale wells in 2006 which will continue eogs strong production growth from the play eog is positioned for significant production and reserve growth in the barnett shale play for many more years 

in the permian basin eog exploited a successful permopenn carbonate play and maintained an active horizontal drilling program in the devonian formation of west texas additionally two new plays in southeast new mexico were deemed successful  a horizontal wolfcamp play where eog drilled six successful wells in 2005 and controls approximately 35000 net acres and a horizontal bone spring shelf play where five successful wells were drilled in 2005 and eog controls approximately 15000 net acres eog drilled 54 net wells in the permian basin in 2005 and net production averaged 92 mmcfd of natural gas and 79 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog has assembled an acreage position of over 130000 net acres in several other growth plays that are currently being tested by drilling with success these plays will move into the exploitation phase in midtolate 2006

eog continued to intensify its activities in the rocky mountain area drilling 119 net wells during 2005 including 47 net wells in the uinta basin utah nine net wells on the labarge platform wyoming 41 net wells on the moxa arch wyoming and seven net wells in the williston basin the net average daily production from the rocky mountain area was 141 mmcfd of natural gas and 75 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog expects to continue increasing drilling activity in these core areas during 2006 while maintaining a very active exploration program

in the midcontinent area eog drilled 137 net wells in its core areas in 2005 most notably the hugotondeep play in the oklahoma panhandle and the cleveland horizontal play in the texas panhandle the net average daily production was 79 mmcfd of natural gas and 21 mbbld of crude oil and condensate eog expanded its hugotondeep program by approximately 900000 acres and 1300 square miles of 3d seismic through the consummation of a 10year joint venture with anadarko petroleum company in its cleveland horizontal program eog has drilled 120 net wells since 2003 and expects to drill another 50 net wells in 2006 during 2005 eog acquired new leases on over 8000 net acres increasing its position to approximately 130000 net acres available to drill for cleveland and high potential morrow accumulations in addition to these two areas eog will continue drilling in the texas panhandle area and pursue exploration prospects throughout the midcontinent area

the upper gulf coast continues to be a significant growth area for eog where 2005 production averaged 113 mmcfd of natural gas and 31 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids eog drilled 24 wells in the sligo field in 2005 and anticipates drilling an equal number of wells in both 2006 and 2007 the expanded cotton valley development program continues with five wells drilled in 2005 and 12 wells planned for 2006 horizontal drilling is now being deployed in a new operating area in the spider field north louisiana where five wells were drilled in 2005 and 13 are planned for 2006 another new growth area is the hosston trend in mississippi where five wells were drilled in 2005 and 10 wells are planned for 2006 eog will continue to develop growth opportunities in east texas north louisiana and mississippi and will test several high potential prospects in the lower gulf coast areas of texas and louisiana during 2006

eog continues to have excellent success in south texas where eog drilled 76 net wells in 2005 the area averaged net production of 181 mmcfd of natural gas and 60 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids this represents the fourth consecutive yearoveryear increase the activity was focused in webb zapata san patricio lavaca duval and other counties where eog executed successful drilling programs in the lobo roleta reklaw frio and wilcox plays significant activity in these areas resulted from successful extensions of existing plays including the frio trend in san patricio and nueces counties and the lobo and roleta trends in webb and zapata counties eog successfully added new lease positions and 3d seismic in 2005 to sustain drilling through 2006 and beyond

in 2005 eog drilled 90 net wells in the appalachian area net production averaged 20 mmcfd of natural gas and 100 barrels per day bbld of crude oil and condensate eog has reduced its focus on the trenton black river and has expanded the development of intermediate depth mississippian and ordovician plays eog expects to drill 85 net wells in 2006 to further expand the shallow and intermediate plays and will continue to focus on the expansion and development of higher impact multiplewell plays

during 2005 eogs net production in the gulf of mexico averaged 41 mmcfd of natural gas and 11 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids four shelf fields eugene island 135 matagorda island 623 high island 206 and mustang island 759 accounted for over 70 of this production due to hurricanes katrina and rita 2005 net production decreased an average of 4 mmcfd and 60 barrels of condensate per day bcpd at yearend a net 6 mmcfd and 98 bcpd remained shutin this shutin production is projected to be online by midyear 2006 during 2005 eog drilled six gross wells resulting in four discoveries the four successful wells two at grand isle 94 and one each at mustang island 762 and high island a443 resulted in a net production increase of 8 mmcfd a similar level of activity is planned in 2006

at december 31 2005 eog held approximately 2805000 net undeveloped acres in the united states 

canada  in canada eog conducts operations through its subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in calgary alberta during 2005 eogrc continued its successful shallow natural gas strategy in western canada an unusually wet summer resulted in surface conditions that restricted the overall drilling program whereby a total of 960 gross wells were drilled in 2005 several soft access shallow natural gas areas will be drilled on the winter frost early in 2006 and will increase eogrcs 2006 drilling program to 1200 wells the 2005 shallow natural gas drilling program included 208 gross horseshoe canyon dry coalbed methane wells eogrcs net production during 2005 averaged 228 mmcfd of natural gas and 33 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids key producing areas in the western canadian sedimentary basin are the southeast albertasouthwest saskatchewan shallow natural gas trends including drumheller and twining areas and the grand prairiewapiti areas of northwest alberta eogrcs ongoing 2006 drilling activity will continue to be concentrated in these areas and will include a similar horseshoe canyon dry coalbed methane program eogrc will also participate in two high impact exploratory tests in the northwest territories during the first quarter of 2006 one on a separate new structure and one as delineation to our summit creek discovery which was tested in early 2005

at december 31 2005 eog held approximately 1590000 net undeveloped acres in canada

operations outside the united states and canada

eog has operations offshore trinidad and the united kingdom north sea and is evaluating additional exploration exploitation and development opportunities in the united kingdom trinidad and other international areas 

trinidad  in november 1992 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidad limited eogrt acquired an exploration and production license with a 95 working interest subject to a 5 overriding royalty interest with an option to convert such overriding royalty interest to a 15 working interest in the south east coast consortium secc block offshore trinidad the kiskadee ibis and parula fields have been developed and are being produced eog is currently developing the oilbird field and expects first production in the first quarter of 2007 the license covering the secc block will expire in december 2029 effective february 3 2005 the other participants in the secc block exercised their option to convert their 5 overriding royalty interest to a 15 working interest thereby reducing eogs working interest to 80 

eogrt and the other participants in the secc block signed a farmin agreement covering the secc deep ibis prospect with bp trinidad and tobago llc in the fourth quarter of 2004 bp will pay the entire cost for drilling the exploratory well which is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2006 eog will retain a 506 working interest in the prospect and will develop the prospect if successful

in july 1996 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidadua block limited signed a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the modified ua block eog holds a 100 working interest in this block the osprey field was discovered in 1998 and commenced production in 2002 

surplus processing and transportation capacity at the pelican field facilities owned and operated by a subsidiary of the other participants in the secc block is being used to process and transport much of eogs natural gas production and all of its crude oil and condensate production from the secc and modified ua blocks crude oil and condensate from eogs trinidad operations are being sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago

in april 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidadlrl unlimited signed a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the lower reverse l lrl block which is adjacent to the secc block eog holds a 100 working interest in the lrl block in the fourth quarter of 2003 eog drilled the first exploration well lrl 1 on this block the well was determined to be noncommercial in november 2004 eog drilled the lrl 2 well which encountered approximately 130 feet of net pay in december 2004 the lrl 3 exploratory well was drilled and determined to be a dry hole eog plans to seek third parties to join in further exploration of the block in 2006

in october 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidad ub block unlimited signed a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the modified ub block which is also adjacent to the secc block eog holds a 55 working interest in and operates the modified ub block primera oil  gas ltd a trinidadian company holds the remaining 45 working interest in september 2004 eog drilled the first exploration well on this block and the well was determined to be noncommercial eog will likely drill another well on the block in 2007

in july 2005 eog through its subsidiary eog resources trinidad block 4a unlimited signed a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for block 4a eog as the operator holds a 90 working interest in block 4a primera block 4a limited a trinidadian company holds the remaining 10 working interest in january 2006 eog completed drilling its first successful exploratory well on this block and plans to drill another well in the first quarter of 2006 eog intends to commence development work on this block by mid2006 and is targeting mid2009 for online production

natural gas from eogs trinidad operations is being sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc under the following arrangements 

under the first takeorpay contract the expiration of which was extended in february 2005 from december 2008 to december 2018 natural gas is delivered to ngc for resale to trinidad local markets during 2005 eog delivered net average production of 115 mmcfd of natural gas under this agreement the extended contract among other things provides for a change in the pricing of wellhead natural gas volumes previously sold under a fixed price schedule with annual escalations prices are now partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices and methanol prices 

under the second takeorpay contract which expires in 2017 eog delivers to ngc approximately 60 mmcfd gross of natural gas which is resold to an anhydrous ammonia plant in point lisas trinidad that is owned and operated by caribbean nitrogen company limited cncl during 2005 46 mmcfd net to eog of natural gas was delivered under this contract to ngc the plant commenced production in june 2002 and currently produces approximately 1900 metric tons of ammonia daily eogrt owns a 12 equity interest in cncl at december 31 2005 eogrts investment in cncl was 18 million at december 31 2005 cncl had a longterm debt balance of 173 million which is nonrecourse to cncls shareholders as part of the financing for cncl the shareholders have entered into a postcompletion deficiency loan agreement with cncl to fund the costs of operations payment of principal and interest to the principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of cncl up to 30 million approximately 4 million of which is net to eogrts interest the shareholders agreement governing cncl requires the consent of the holders of 90 or more of the shares to take certain material actions accordingly given its current level of equity ownership eogrt is able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of cncl and therefore eog accounts for the investment using the equity method during 2005 eog recognized equity income of 9 million and received cash dividends of 5 million from cncl

under a fifteenyear takeorpay contract which expires in 2019 eog delivers to ngc approximately 60 mmcfd gross of natural gas which is resold to an anhydrous ammonia plant in point lisas trinidad that is owned and operated by nitrogen 2000 unlimited n2000 during 2005 48 mmcfd net to eog of natural gas was delivered under this contract to ngc the plant commenced production in august 2004 and currently produces approximately 2100 metric tons of ammonia daily eogs subsidiary eog resources nitro2000 ltd eognitro2000 owned a 10 equity interest in n2000 at december 31 2005 in february 2005 eognitro2000 sold a portion of its ownership interest to one of the other shareholders reducing eognitro2000s equity interest in n2000 to 10 at december 31 2004 eognitro2000s equity interest in n2000 was 23 the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 2 million at december 31 2005 eognitro2000s investment in n2000 was 16 million at december 31 2005 n2000 had a longterm debt balance of 197 million which is nonrecourse to n2000s shareholders as part of the loan agreement for the n2000 financing affiliates of the shareholders have entered into a postcompletion deficiency loan agreement with n2000 to fund the costs of operations payment of principal and interest to the principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of n2000 up to 30 million approximately 3 million of which is to be provided by the immediate parent company of eognitro2000 the shareholders agreement governing n2000 requires the consent of the holders of 100 of the shares to take certain material actions accordingly given its current level of equity ownership eognitro2000 is able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of n2000 and therefore eog accounts for the investment using the equity method during 2005 eog recognized equity income of 7 million and received cash dividends of 2 million from n2000 

under a natural gas contract signed in january 2004 eog is currently supplying approximately 100 mmcfd gross of natural gas to ngc which is then being resold by ngc to a methanol plant located in point lisas trinidad the plant in which eog does not own an interest started production during the fourth quarter of 2005 under this gas contract eog expects to ultimately supply approximately 94 mmcfd gross 60 mmcfd net to eog based on current pricing and operating assumptions for the first four years of the contract term and approximately 122 mmcfd gross 80 mmcfd net to eog based on current pricing and operating assumptions for the remaining term of the elevenyear contract

in february 2005 eogrt executed a twentyyear takeorpay contract with ngc lng train 4 limited a subsidiary of ngc for the supply of 30 mmcfd gross 17 mmcfd net to eog based on current pricing and operating assumptions of natural gas for use in a lng plant in point fortin trinidad the lng plant began prestart up operations in december 2005 during the first quarter of 2006 eog expects to supply varying amounts of gas while ngc awaits the completion of pipelines from third party producers who also are under contract with ngc to supply incremental gas volumes into the lng plant eog has no equity investment in the lng plant

in 2005 eogs average net production from trinidad was 231 mmcfd of natural gas and 45 mbbld of crude oil and condensate

at december 31 2005 eog held approximately 261600 net undeveloped acres in trinidad 

united kingdom in 2002 eogs subsidiary eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk acquired a 25 nonoperating working interest in a portion of block 4916 located in the southern gas basin of the north sea in august 2004 production commenced in the valkyrie field in the southern gas basin 

in 2003 eoguk acquired a 30 nonoperating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532 these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north sea in november 2003 a successful exploratory well arthur 1 was drilled in the arthur field production from arthur 1 commenced in january 2005 the arthur 2 well was drilled during the first quarter of 2005 as an extension to the arthur 1 discovery production from arthur 2 commenced in july 2005 another development well arthur 3 is planned for the first half of 2006 as an extension to the current discovery

in the first half of 2005 eoguk completed the drilling of two exploration wells west boulton and polecat which were both determined to be noncommercial

in 2005 eog delivered net average production of 39 mmcfd of natural gas in the united kingdom

at december 31 2005 eog held approximately 355500 net undeveloped acres in the united kingdom 

other international eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified

marketing

wellhead marketing eogs united states and canada wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and under longterm natural gas contracts at marketresponsive prices in many instances the longterm contract prices closely approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the spot market in 2005 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts will remain the same in 2006 also in trinidad in late december 2005 eog began selling wellhead natural gas volumes under a new contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices in the united kingdom wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market

substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate is sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive prices

during 2005 sales to a major integrated oil and gas company with investment grade credit ratings accounted for 11 of eogs oil and gas revenues no other individual purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs oil and gas revenues for the same period eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog

wellhead volumes and prices

the following table sets forth certain information regarding eogs wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf crude oil and condensate per barrel bbl and natural gas liquids per bbl the table also presents natural gas equivalent volumes on a thousand cubic feet equivalent basis mcfe  natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 60 mcf of natural gas to 10 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids delivered during each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005

 1 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids 2 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 3 includes 023 per mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract

competition

eog competes for reserve acquisitions and explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions frequently against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources to the extent eogs exploration budget is lower than that of certain of its competitors eog may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves leases licenses and concessions competitive factors include price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies in addition eog faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other countries

regulation

united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various types of regulation including regulation in the united states by state and federal agencies

united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations which among other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and regulate environmental and safety matters 

a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms both federal agencies operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous statutory and regulatory restrictions certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory requirements including the need for prior mms approval for exploration development and production plans stringent engineering and construction specifications applicable to offshore production facilities regulations restricting the flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all production facilities under certain circumstances the mms may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely affect eogs interests

in 2002 the dc circuit reversed a 2000 district court decision and upheld a 1997 mms gas valuation rule categorically denying allowances for postproduction marketing costs such as longterm storage fees and marketer fees however the dc circuit decision expressly allows firm demand charges to be deducted two trade associations had sought judicial review of the 1997 gas valuation rule and procured a favorable district court decision however the dc circuit decision and denial of certorari by the supreme court ended the litigation in early 2003 on march 10 2005 the mms published a final rule further revising the gas valuation regulations the 2005 gas rule revision clarifies the deductibility of transportation costs and adopts the 2004 oil valuation rules cost of capital approach for calculating nonarms length transportation allowances described below eog cannot predict what effect these changes will have on eog operations but nothing significant is anticipated

in 2004 the mms further amended its royalty regulations governing the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases the mmss 2000 oil valuation rule had replaced a set of valuation benchmarks based on posted prices and comparable sales with an indexing system based on spot prices at nearby market centers among other things the 2000 oil valuation rule like the 1997 gas valuation rule also categorically disallowed deductions for postproduction marketing costs two industry trade associations sought judicial review of the 2000 oil valuation rule but voluntarily dismissed their suit after late 2002 negotiations led the mms to amend its oil valuation rule further in 2004 the amended rule retained indexing for valuation but replaced spot prices with new york mercantile exchange future prices except in the rocky mountain region and california the 2004 oil valuation rule also liberalized allowances for nonarms length transportation arrangements by increasing the multiplier used for calculating the cost of capital while the 2000 oil valuation rule was likely to increase eogs royalty obligation somewhat the 2004 oil valuation rule is likely to lessen that increase

sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are made at unregulated market prices

the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of its own production all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms and conditions consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable contract provisions eogs jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales

eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation eogs gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services

eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor adopted from time to time although eog cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its operations the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes

proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress the state legislatures the ferc the state regulatory commissions and the federal and state courts eog cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective it should also be noted that the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being followed by the ferc will continue indefinitely

environmental regulation  united states various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production  the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government these regulatory authorities may impose regulations on or otherwise intervene in the oil and natural gas industry with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to complaints or economic or political conditions the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities increase eogs costs and may have a material adverse impact on its operations 

it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect eog operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted 

in addition each province has regulations that govern land tenure royalties production rates and other matters the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from private lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 

environmental regulation  canada all phases of the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations such laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills releases and emissions of various substances to the environment these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with eogs operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in addition new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment while compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative civil or criminal penalties suspension or revocation of licenses and in some instances the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 

spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted or result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations such contamination is not unusual within the crude oil and natural gas industries any contamination found on under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under canadian laws eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be held responsible for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 

in december 2002 the canadian federal government ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change which requires canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 below 1990 levels over the 20082012 periods the climate change plan for canada  which was released in november 2002 outlines in very general terms the approach the canadian government intends to take to implement its emissions reduction commitment the canadian government issued a further climate change plan moving forward on climate change a plan for honouring our kyoto commitment  in april of 2005 companies designated as large final emitters of greenhouse gases lfes which will include a number of companies in the oil and gas sector will be assigned targets for emissions reduction lfes may meet their targets through investments in their own activities the purchase of emissions credits from other emitters investment in domestic offset credits and the purchase of international credits the canadian government has renewed its promise that the cost to industry of compliance will not exceed 15 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent the canadian government has also committed that post2012 emissions reduction targets will not make canadian oil and gas production uncompetitive and that industry will be consulted on the technical feasibility and economic impacts of targets for the period post2012 the canadian governments stated preference is to use the canadian environmental protection act to regulate industry where necessary it is expected however that the canadian government will largely delegate regulatory responsibility to the provinces through equivalency agreements whereby a province will perform the necessary regulatory function if it has a substantively identical or more onerous program in place as compared to that implemented by the canadian government the final rules once known could affect operations and profitability 

other international regulation eogs exploration and production operations outside the united states and canada are subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that country eog currently has operations in trinidad and the united kingdom 

other matters

energy prices since eog is primarily a natural gas producer it is more significantly impacted by changes in prices for natural gas than changes in prices for crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids average united states and canada wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the last three years these fluctuations resulted in a 75 increase in the average wellhead natural gas price for production in the united states and canada received by eog from 2002 to 2003 an increase of 12 from 2003 to 2004 and an increase of 37 from 2004 to 2005 in 2005 a large majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices the pricing mechanisms for these contracts will remain the same in 2006 also in trinidad in late december 2005 eog began selling wellhead natural gas volumes under a new contract at prices partially dependent on the united states henry hub market prices in the united kingdom wellhead natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated during the last three years due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment the availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate ammonia and methanol prices in the future

assuming a totally unhedged position for 2006 based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2006 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately 24 million for net income and operating cash flow eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil prices eogs price sensitivity in 2006 for each 100 per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil price is approximately 6 million for net income and operating cash flow summarized below and in note 11 to consolidated financial statements is information regarding eogs current 2006 natural gas hedge position as of february 22 2006 eog had no crude oil hedges

risk management eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time these activities are intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps as the means to manage this price risk in addition to financial transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or marktomarket accounting the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices

presented below is a summary of eogs 2006 natural gas financial collar and price swap contracts at february 22 2006 with prices expressed in dollars per million british thermal units mmbtu and notional volumes in million british thermal units per day mmbtud as indicated eog does not have any financial collar or price swap contracts that cover periods beyond october 2006 eog accounts for these collar and price swap contracts using marktomarket accounting 

 

all of eogs natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil including blowouts cratering and fires each of which could result in damage to life andor property offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions eogs activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations in accordance with customary industry practices insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of the risks losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance please refer to item 1a risk factors beginning on page 14 for further discussion of the risks to which eog is subject

eogs operations outside of the united states and canada are subject to certain risks including expropriation of assets risks of increases in taxes and government royalties renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments political instability payment delays limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses as well as changes in laws regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies 

texas severance tax exemption natural gas production from qualifying texas wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to use a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production however the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a wellbywell basis

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or financial results if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us

prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely since we are primarily a natural gas company we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are

the level of consumer demand 

weather conditions 

domestic drilling activity 

the price and availability of alternative fuels 

the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities 

worldwide economic and political conditions 

the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and 

the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation 

our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets

our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing

the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities or our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons or may not be available to us in the future 

reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be overstated 

estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be overstated 

to prepare estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows we analyze many variable factors such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas we also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data and the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices production costs severance and excise taxes capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs actual results most likely will vary from our estimates any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves 

if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves our reserves and production will decline from their current levels

the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future crude oil and natural gas production is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 

drilling crude oil and natural gas wells including development wells involves numerous risks including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment in addition we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling completing and operating wells further our drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including 

unexpected drilling conditions 

title problems 

pressure or irregularities in formations 

equipment failures or accidents 

adverse weather conditions 

compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements which may increase our costs or restrict our activities and 

costs of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs tubular materials and equipment 

we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations especially regulations relating to environmental protection and could incur even greater costs in the future

our exploration production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels as well as by other countries in which we do business we have and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations further the crude oil and natural gas industry regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could hurt our business

we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities

exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities injure or kill people and damage property and the environment offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce our revenues and increase our costs to the extent not covered by insurance

the occurrence of any of these events and any payments made as a result of such events and the liabilities related thereto would reduce the funds available for exploration drilling and production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks

from time to time we use derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil prices and net income and cash flow to the extent that we engage in hedging activities we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges in addition we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed 

if we acquire oil and gas properties our failure to fully identify potential problems to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could seriously harm us

from time to time we seek to acquire oil and gas properties although we perform reviews of acquired properties that we believe are consistent with industry practices reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential even when problems with a property are identified we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 

in addition acquisitions may have adverse effects on our operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations

terrorist activities and military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as the military or other actions taken in response to these acts cause instability in the global financial and energy markets the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these actions could adversely affect us in unpredictable ways including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terror 

competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 

we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and the marketing of crude oil and natural gas production higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 

many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than those we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas production such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition development production exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations commercial paper and to a lesser extent and if necessary bank borrowings and public and private equity and debt offerings lower crude oil and natural gas prices however would reduce our cash flow and our access to the capital markets further if the condition of the capital markets materially declines we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable in addition a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment

reserve information for estimates of eogs net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based

in general production from eogs oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration exploitation and development activities the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

1 restated for twoforone stock split effective march 1 2005 as discussed below

on february 2 2005 eog announced that the board of directors had approved a twoforone stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to record holders as of february 15 2005 and to be issued on march 1 2005 in addition the board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock by 33 resulting in a quarterly cash dividend of 008 per share presplit or 004 per share postsplit

on february 1 2006 the board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous 004 per share to 006 per share

as of february 17 2006 there were approximately 270 record holders of eogs common stock including individual participants in security position listings there are an estimated 122000 beneficial owners of eogs common stock including shares held in street name

eog currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock however the determination of the amount of future cash dividends if any to be declared and paid will depend upon among other things the financial condition funds from operations level of exploration exploitation and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of eog

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

eog resources inc eog is one of the largest independent nonintegrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states canada offshore trinidad and the united kingdom north sea eog operates under a consistent strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return drilling internally generated prospects delivering longterm production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet

net income available to common for 2005 of 1252 million was up 104 compared to 2004 net income available to common of 614 million attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production at december 31 2005 eogs total reserves were 62 trillion cubic feet equivalent an increase of 548 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december 31 2004

operations

several important developments have occurred since january 1 2005 

united states and canada the fort worth texas office was opened in 2004 to expand on eogs drilling success in the barnett shale play of the fort worth basin eog has successfully expanded the play beyond its conventional limits by using horizontal drilling and enhanced completion technology by yearend 2005 eog had over 500000 acres under lease in several counties eog plans on substantially increasing its drilling program in 2006

eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada eog plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eogs crude oil and natural gas production eog has several larger potential plays under way in wyoming utah texas oklahoma and western canada 

international during 2005 eog commenced natural gas production in trinidad to supply two new longterm contracts first eog is supplying natural gas that is being used as feedstock for the m5000 methanol plant which commenced operations in september 2005 second the atlantic lng train 4 alng began taking gas in december 2005 prior to commercial operations and volumes supplied by eog during this prestart up period have been higher than eogs contractual rate 

although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas eog sees an increasing linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply for example liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing and planned facilities in trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing united states demand in addition ammonia methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the united states and canada to trinidad driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation eog believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants the new methanol plant and the alng will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada natural gas fundamentals

in 2005 eog continued its progress in the southern gas basin of the united kingdom north sea production commenced in january 2005 from the arthur 1 well and in july 2005 from the arthur 2 well the arthur 3 well is expected to spud in the first half of 2006 eog expects only modest activity in 2006 due to the difficulty in obtaining rigs in the north sea

capital structure

as noted one of managements key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debttototal capitalization ratio at december 31 2005 eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 down from 27 at yearend 2004 by primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in 2005 eog funded its 1858 million exploration and development expenditures paid down 93 million of debt and paid dividends to common shareholders of 36 million in addition in 2006 eogs board of directors increased the cash dividend on common stock to an annual rate of 024 per share which represents a 50 increase in the annual cash dividend as management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for 2006 eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations 

for 2006 eogs estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately 25 billion excluding acquisitions united states and canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort when it fits eogs strategy eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production opportunities management believes that eog continues to maintain one of the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history 

the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f1

during 2005 net operating revenues increased 1349 million to 3620 million from 2271 million in 2004 total wellhead revenues which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids increased 1306 million or 57 to 3607 million as compared to 2301 million in 2004 natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids revenues solely represent wellhead revenues for these products wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december 31 were as follows

 

1 million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day as applicable 2 dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel as applicable 3 includes 023 per mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract 4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent as applicable includes natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids

2005 compared to 2004 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased 1097 million or 60 to 2939 million from 1842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price 763 million increased natural gas deliveries 315 million and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad takeorpay contract 19 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36 to 662 per mcf for 2005 from 486 per mcf in 2004 excluding the aforementioned adjustment the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35 to 658 per mcf for 2005 this adjustment increased the average trinidad wellhead natural gas price by 023 per mcf for 2005

natural gas deliveries increased 180 mmcfd or 17 to 1216 mmcfd for 2005 from 1036 mmcfd in 2004 the increase was due to higher production of 87 mmcfd in the united states 45 mmcfd in trinidad 32 mmcfd in the united kingdom and 16 mmcfd in canada the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas 63 mmcfd and louisiana 20 mmcfd the increase in trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants the increase in the united kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the arthur field in january 2005 24 mmcfd and the full year production from the valkyrie field which commenced production in august 2004 8 mmcfd the increase in canada was attributable to the drilling program primarily in the wapiti drumheller and connorsville areas

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 168 million or 42 to 571 million from 403 million as compared to 2004 due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 151 million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 17 million the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was 5463 per barrel compared to 4022 per barrel for 2004

natural gas liquids revenues increased 42 million or 76 to 97 million from 55 million as compared to 2004 due to increases in the composite average price 23 million and deliveries 19 million

during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million during 2004 eog recognized losses on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 33 million which included realized losses of 82 million and collar premium payments of 1 million 

2004 compared to 2003 wellhead natural gas revenues for 2004 increased 307 million or 20 to 1842 million from 1535 million for 2003 due to increases in natural gas deliveries 134 million and the composite average wellhead natural gas price 173 million the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 10 to 486 per mcf for 2004 from 440 per mcf in 2003

natural gas deliveries increased 81 mmcfd or 8 to 1036 mmcfd for 2004 from 955 mmcfd in 2003 due to a 47 mmcfd or 28 increase in canada a 34 mmcfd or 22 increase in trinidad and a 7 mmcfd increase in the united kingdom due to commencement of production in august 2004 partially offset by a 7 mmcfd or 1 decline in the united states the increased deliveries in canada 47 mmcfd were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and additional production related to post acquisition drilling the increase in trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the ua block 22 mmcfd which began supplying natural gas in mid2004 to the n2000 ammonia plant and commencement of production from the parula wells on the secc block in february 2004 12 mmcfd

wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 149 million or 59 to 403 million from 254 million as compared to 2003 due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price 103 million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries 46 million the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2004 was 4022 per barrel compared to 2992 per barrel for 2003

wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased 42 mbbld or 18 to 274 mbbld from 232 mbbld for 2003 the increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the united states 26 mbbld and higher production in trinidad from the parula wells 08 mbbld and from the ua block as a result of new production 04 mbbld

natural gas liquids revenues were 26 million higher than a year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries 14 million and the composite average price 12 million

during 2004 eog recognized losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 33 million which included realized losses of 82 million and collar premium payments of 1 million during 2003 eog recognized losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 80 million which included realized losses of 45 million and collar premium payments of 3 million 

operating and other expenses

2005 compared to 2004  during 2005 operating expenses of 1628 million were 336 million higher than the 1292 million incurred in 2004 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

1 total perunit costs do not include exploration costs dry hole costs and impairments

the perunit costs of lease and well including transportation dda taxes other than income and interest expense net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below

lease and well expense includes expenses for eog operated properties as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property lease and well expense can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eogs oil and natural gas wells the cost of workovers transportation costs associated with selling hydrocarbon products and lease and well administrative expenses operating and maintenance expenses include among other service costs pumping services salt water disposal equipment repair and maintenance compression expense lease upkeep fuel and power workovers are costs to restore or maintain production from existing wells

each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient safe and environmentally responsible operations eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas operating costs within these existing and new areas as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors fluctuate over time

lease and well expenses including transportation of 373 million were 102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states 40 million increased transportation related costs in the united states 28 million and the united kingdom 7 million higher lease and well administrative expenses in the united states 11 million changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million and higher workover expenditures in the united states 3 million and trinidad 2 million

dda of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method eogs dda rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations there are several factors that can impact an individual field such as the field production profile drilling or acquisition of new wells disposition of existing wells reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments changes to the individual fields due to any of these factors may cause eogs composite dda rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 

dda expenses of 654 million were 150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the united states 46 million canada 6 million and trinidad 5 million and the commencement of production in the united kingdom 14 million dda rates increased in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties 59 million and in canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves 9 million the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dda expense increase 8 million

taxes other than income include severanceproduction taxes ad valoremproperty taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes taxes other than income of 199 million were 65 million higher than 2004

severanceproduction taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the united states 41 million trinidad 7 million and canada 3 million partially offset by the increase in credits taken for a texas high cost gas severance tax exemption 10 million and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 5 million other items contributing to the increase were an additional trinidadian supplemental petroleum tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to january 2004 7 million and 2004 production tax relief in trinidad 6 million ad valoremproperty taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states 11 million 

net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of 2008 notes 8 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements excluding these early retirement costs the 2005 net interest expense decreased 8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest 5 million an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 2 million and lower average debt balance in the united states 1 million

exploration costs of 133 million were 39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the barnett shale area

impairments include amortization of unproved leases as well as impairments under the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of longlived assets based on future cash flow analysis impairments of 78 million were 4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the united states 12 million and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain longlived assets in canada 8 million partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain longlived assets in the united states 14 million and higher amortization of unproved leases in canada 2 million eog recorded impairments of 31 million and 25 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively under sfas no 144 for certain properties in the united states and canada

other income net of 36 million increased 26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties 7 million interest income 6 million and equity income from investments in the caribbean nitrogen company limited cncl and nitrogen 2000 unlimited n2000 ammonia plants in 2005 5 million decreased net foreign currency transaction losses 4 million and a gain on the sale of part of eogs interest in the n2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 2 million

income tax provision of 706 million increased 404 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to higher pretax income 383 million and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 24 million the effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36 from 33 in 2004 

2004 compared to 2003  during 2004 operating expenses of 1292 million were 245 million higher than the 1047 million incurred in 2003 the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december 31

 

the higher perunit costs of lease and well including transportation dda and taxes other than income for 2004 compared to 2003 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below

lease and well expenses including transportation of 271 million were 58 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities including an increase in the number of wells in the united states 18 million canada 16 million and trinidad 1 million increased transportation related costs in the united states 14 million canada 2 million and the united kingdom 2 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate 5 million

dda expenses of 504 million increased 63 million from 2003 due primarily to increased production in canada 18 million the united states 10 million and trinidad 4 million the commencement of production in the united kingdom 2 million increased dda rates in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties 13 million increased dda rates in canada mainly from developing acquired proved reserves 8 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate 7 million

ga expenses of 115 million were 15 million higher than 2003 due primarily to expanded operations

taxes other than income of 134 million were 48 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a decrease in credits taken against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of additional wells for a texas high cost gas severance tax exemption 19 million an increase as a result of higher wellhead revenues in the united states 13 million trinidad 2 million and canada 1 million higher property taxes as a result of higher property valuation in the united states 6 million the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 5 million and an increase in the number of wells and facilities in canada 2 million

exploration costs of 94 million were 18 million higher than 2003 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states 6 million canada 3 million the united kingdom 3 million and trinidad 1 million and increased exploration administrative expenses across eog 4 million

impairments of 82 million were 8 million lower than 2003 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the united states 10 million partially offset by higher amortization of unproved leases in canada 2 million total impairments under sfas no 144 were 25 million in each of 2004 and 2003

net interest expense of 63 million was 4 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a slightly higher average debt balance

other income expense net for 2004 included income from equity investments of 11 million gains on sales of reserves and related assets of 6 million and foreign currency transaction losses of 7 million as a result of applying the changes in the canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany shortterm loans that eliminate in consolidation

income tax provision increased 85 million to 301 million compared to 2003 primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes 95 million offset by lower deferred income taxes associated with the alberta canada corporate tax rate 5 million and lower effective foreign income tax rates 2 million the net effective tax rate for 2004 remained unchanged from the 2003 rate of 33 

in november 2003 canada enacted legislation reducing the canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource sector from 28 to 27 for 2003 with further reductions to 21 phased in over the next four years this legislation also made changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource allowance beginning in 2003 canadian taxpayers are allowed to deduct 10 of actual provincial and other crown royalties this percentage increases each year through 2007 at which time 100 of crown royalties will be deductible the resource allowance a statutory deduction calculated as 25 of adjusted resource profits will be phased out through 2007 when the deduction will be completely eliminated

1 asset retirement costs for 2003 does not include the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january 1 2003

exploration and development expenditures of 1858 million for 2005 were 347 million higher than the prior year due primarily to i increased drilling and facilities expenditures of 338 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states 377 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate related to drilling and facilities expenditures 17 million partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united kingdom 24 million trinidad 21 million and canada 11 million and ii increased exploration costs 39 million primarily in the barnett shale area partially offset by decreased dry hole costs 27 million the 2005 exploration and development expenditures of 1858 million includes 1300 million in development 487 million in exploration 56 million in property acquisitions and 15 million in capitalized interest the 2004 exploration and development expenditures of 1511 million includes 1009 million in development 440 million in exploration 52 million in property acquisitions and 10 million in capitalized interest the 2003 exploration and development expenditures of 1321 million included 651 million in development 256 million in exploration 405 million in property acquisitions and 9 million in capitalized interest

the level of exploration and development expenditures including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant there are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans

derivative transactions

during 2005 eog recognized gains on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 10 million which included realized gains of 10 million during 2004 eog recognized losses on marktomarket financial commodity derivative contracts of 33 million which included realized losses of 82 million and collar premium payments of 1 million see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

financing

eogs debttototal capitalization ratio was 19 as of december 31 2005 compared to 27 as of december 31 2004 

during 2005 total debt decreased 93 million to 985 million see note 2 to consolidated financial statements the estimated fair value of eogs debt at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 1025 million and 1146 million respectively the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and where such prices were not available upon interest rates currently available to eog at yearend eogs debt is primarily at fixed interest rates at december 31 2005 a 1 decline in interest rates would result in a 46 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 11 to consolidated financial statements 

during 2005 and 2004 eog utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations while eog maintains a 600 million commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time during 2005 was 380 million and the amount outstanding at yearend was zero eog considers this excess availability which is backed by the 600 million revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements combined with approximately 688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 

in 2005 the shortterm commercial paper loan balance was reduced by 92 million the 174 million 600 notes due 2008 and the remaining 75 million outstanding under the senior unsecured term loan facility were repaid primarily with cash generated from operating activities on february 17 2006 a foreign subsidiary of eog repaid 50 million of the 250 million it borrowed in 2005 see note 2 to consolidated financial statements during 2006 based on resources available at december 31 2005 eog plans to pay off the 126 million 670 notes due 2006 

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes eogs contractual obligations at december 31 2005 in thousands

 1 this table does not include the liability for dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties effective with adoption of sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january 1 2003 eog recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation see note 13 to consolidated financial statements in addition this table does not include eogs pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note 6 to consolidated financial statements 2 amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31 2005 management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog

shelf registration

as of february 22 2006 the amount available under various filed registration statements with the securities and exchange commission for the offer and sale from time to time of eog debt securities preferred stock andor common stock totaled approximately 688 million

offbalance sheet arrangements

eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such entities often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

during 2005 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries including canada trinidad and the united kingdom the foreign currency most significant to eogs operations during 2005 was the canadian dollar the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar in 2005 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eogs canadian subsidiaries however since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk

effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to consolidated financial statements eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 under those provisions as of december 31 2005 eog recorded the fair value of the swap of 36 million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the aftertax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of 5 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets

outlook

natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry in eogs opinion overall natural gas production in the united states is declining in addition the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels such as oil and coal

assuming a totally unhedged position for 2006 based on eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural gas volumes for 2006 for which prices have not been determined under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately 24 million for net income and operating cash flow eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price eogs price sensitivity in 2006 for each 100 per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately 6 million for net income and operating cash flow for information regarding eogs natural gas hedge position as of december 31 2005 see note 11 to consolidated financial statements

marketing companies have played an important role in the united states and canada natural gas market these companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like eog and then resell the gas to end users local distribution companies or other buyers in recent years several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty and others are exiting this business eog does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production eog continues to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate to seek new markets

eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada however in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north sea eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the united states and canada in addition eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities budgeted 2006 exploration and development expenditures excluding acquisitions are approximately 25 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of funding the united states and canada exploration exploitation development and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow

the level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2006 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors based upon existing economic and market conditions eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2006 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year however eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration exploitation development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and the united kingdom such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog

environmental regulations

various federal state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into the environment in addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control under environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators in addition eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 

summary of critical accounting policies

eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies following is a discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

proved oil and gas reserves 

eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which directly impact financial accounting estimates including depreciation depletion and amortization proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

oil and gas exploration costs

oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made all other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year as of december 31 2005 and 2004 eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note 16 to consolidated financial statements these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization costs to develop proved reserves including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized

oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is recognized unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical experience is amortized over the average holding period if the unproved properties are determined to be productive the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense holding all other factors constant if reserves were revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease respectively 

depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unitofproduction method the reserve base used to calculate depletion depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties with respect to lease and well equipment costs which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves estimated future dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage values are taken into account certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis 

assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas no 19 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field 

amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor property dispositions and 4 impairments 

stock options

eog accounted for stock options under the provisions and related interpretations of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees no compensation expense was recognized for such options as allowed by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation issued in 1995 eog continued to apply apb opinion no 25 for purposes of determining net income and to present the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 123

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which supersedes sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 123 sfas no 123r establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 25 sfas no 123r is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2005 eog adopted sfas no 123r effective january 1 2006 using the modified prospective method eog expects this will reduce 2006 net earnings by a pretax amount of approximately 25 million taking into consideration the estimated forfeitures and cancellations this amount includes approximately 21 million of expense for unvested options outstanding at december 31 2005 and approximately 1 million of expense for the employee stock purchase plan sfas no 123r also requires a public entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock options exercised in the financing cash flows section of the statement of cash flows had sfas no 123r been in effect eogs net cash provided by operating activities would have been reduced and its net cash provided by financing activities would have been increased on its consolidated statements of cash flows by 51 million 29 million and 12 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

item 1  business

general

     eog resources inc eog a delaware corporation organized
in 1985 together with its subsidiaries explores for develops
produces and markets natural gas and crude oil primarily in major
producing basins in the united states of america canada
offshore trinidad the united kingdom north sea and from time to
time select other international areas  eogs principal
producing areas are further described under exploration and
production below  eogs website address is
httpwwweogresourcescom  eogs annual reports on form 10k
quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and
all amendments to those reports are made available free of
charge through its website as soon as reasonably practicable
after such reports have been filed with the securities and
exchange commission sec

     at december 31 2004 eogs total estimated net proved
reserves were 5647 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe of
which 5047 billion cubic feet bcf were natural gas reserves
and 100 million barrels mmbbl or 600 bcfe were crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids reserves see supplemental
information to consolidated financial statements  at such
date approximately 50 of eogs reserves on a natural gas
equivalent basis were located in the united states 25 in
trinidad 24 in canada and 1 in the united kingdom north sea
as of december 31 2004 eog employed approximately 1250
persons including foreign national employees

     eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on
investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs
this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow
and earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective
basis  eog focuses its drilling activity toward natural gas
deliverability in addition to natural gas reserve replacement and
to a lesser extent crude oil exploitation and exploration  eog
focuses on the costeffective utilization of advances in
technology associated with the gathering processing and
interpretation of threedimensional seismic data the development
of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor improved
drill bits mud motors and mud additives and formation logging
techniques and reservoir fracturing methods these advanced
technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to reduce
the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas reserve
exploration exploitation and development  eog implements its
strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated
prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves  eog
also makes select tactical acquisitions that result in additional
economies of scale or land positions with significant additional
prospects  maintaining the lowest possible operating cost
structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is
also an important goal in the implementation of eogs strategy

     with respect to information on eogs working interest in
wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are
determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by
eogs working interest in the wells or acreage

business segments

     eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil
exploration and production related

exploration and production

  united states and canada operations

     eogs operations are focused on most of the productive
basins in the united states and canada

     at december 31 2004 88 of eogs net proved united states
and canada reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were
natural gas and 12 were crude oil condensate and natural gas
liquids  a substantial portion of eogs united states and canada
natural gas reserves are in longlived fields with well
established production histories eog believes that opportunities
exist to increase production in and around many of these fields
through continued development and application of new technology
eog will also continue an active exploration program designed to
extend fields and add new trends to its broad portfolio of united
states and canada plays  the following is a summary of
significant developments during 2004 and certain 2005 plans for
eogs united states and canada operations

                                  1


     united states  during 2004 eog opened a new office in fort
worth texas to expand eogs drilling success in the barnett
shale play of the fort worth basin  eog made significant gas
discoveries in the noncore portion of the trend located south
and west of the city of fort worth drilling 27 net horizontal
barnett wells in 2004 as a result of this success eog rapidly
expanded its leasehold position and ended 2004 with approximately
400000 net acres in the barnett play  during december 2004 eog
reached 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day mmcfed net
production from the fort worth basin  eog plans to drill 90
barnett horizontal wells and will continue to add acreage in the
barnett trend during 2005

     in the permian basin eog maintained successful horizontal
programs in the devonian play of west texas and in the bone
spring play of southeast new mexico  improvements in technology
continued to yield increases in production rates and reserves
when compared to completions of previous years eog drilled 46
net wells in the permian basin in 2004 and net production
averaged 97 million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas and
83 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids  eog has assembled a substantial acreage
position of over 130000 net acres in a number of new plays in
this area many of which will be tested during 2005

     eog continued to intensify its activities in the rocky
mountain area during 2004  eog has ramped up operations in its
traditional plays drilling 48 net wells in the chapitanatural
buttes area of the uinta basin utah and 40 net wells in each
area of wyomings green river basin  the big piney area and the
labarge platformmoxa arch area  eog also drilled 16 net wells
in the bakken horizontal play of the williston basin in montana
the net daily production from the rocky mountain area averaged
129 mmcfd of natural gas and 63 mbbld of crude oil condensate
and natural gas liquids  eog expects to further increase
drilling activity in 2005 in both the uinta basin of utah and the
green river basin of wyoming and also continue exploration
drilling in other rocky mountain basins

     in the midcontinent area eog drilled 150 net wells in its
two core areas in 2004  the hugotondeep play in the oklahoma
panhandle and the cleveland horizontal play in the texas
panhandle  the net average daily production was 70 mmcfd of
natural gas and 19 mbbld of crude oil and condensate  eog
expanded its cleveland position over the last year to 110000 net
acres  eog has drilled 70 net cleveland horizontal wells during
the past few years and expects to drill another 50 net wells in
2005  eog has also obtained the rights on 40000 of these
cleveland acres to drill for high potential morrow accumulations
eog expects its hugoton deep program to continue at a level
comparable to 2004  in addition to these two core areas eog
will continue active exploration programs throughout oklahoma
kansas and the texas panhandle

     the upper gulf coast continues to be a significant producing
and exploration area for eog  new operating trends have been
added in east texas and louisiana through exploration and
property trades  most notably a significant lower cotton valley
field discovery was made in north louisiana at the driscoll
mountain field where a development of five net wells is planned
for 2005  eog drilled 53 net wells in the upper gulf coast area
during 2004 and averaged net production of 94 mmcfd of natural
gas and 29 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas
liquids  in the sligo field eog has drilled 45 net wells since
the completion of a property trade in mid2003 increasing net
natural gas production from 25 mmcfd to 87 mmcfd  eog is
anticipating running two to three rigs full time in the sligo
field throughout 2005  eog will continue to develop growth
opportunities in east texas north louisiana and mississippi
and will test several high potential prospects in the lower gulf
coast areas of texas and louisiana during 2005

     eog continues to have success in south texas where eog
drilled or participated in 76 net wells in 2004  the area
averaged net production of 169 mmcfd of natural gas and 47 mbbld
of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  the activity
was mainly focused in webb zapata nueces lavaca and duval
counties  eog executed successful drilling programs in the lobo
roleta frio wilcox and olmos plays  significant activity in
these areas resulted from successful extensions of existing
plays including the frio trend in san patricio and nueces
counties and the lobo and roleta trends in webb and zapata
counties  eog successfully added new lease positions in 2004 to
sustain drilling through 2005 and beyond

     in 2004 eog drilled 70 net wells in the appalachian area
and net production averaged 23 mmcfd of natural gas  eog
continues to pursue the trenton black river play in new york and
has begun to develop other intermediate depth plays in west
virginia and new york in mississippian and ordovician age
reservoirs  eog expects to drill over 100 net wells in 2005 in
this area

                                  2


     in the gulf of mexico four shelf fields south timbalier
156 eugene island 135 high island 206 and matagorda island 623
accounted for over 60 of eogs 2004 net production  during
2004 total net production averaged 44 mmcfd of natural gas and
17 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  the
matagorda island 685 field a 2003 discovery commenced sales in
july 2004  eog has a 675 working interest in the field which
was producing 9 mmcfed net of natural gas and condensate at
yearend  in 2004 eog drilled or participated in nine gross
wells eog plans a similar level of activity on the gulf of
mexico shelf in 2005

     at december 31 2004 eog held approximately 2609400 net
undeveloped acres in the united states

     canada  in canada eog conducts operations through its
subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in
calgary alberta  during 2004 eogrc was again successful with
its shallow natural gas strategy in western canada drilling a
record of 1254 net wells and increasing its production and
reserve base  eogrcs net production during 2004 averaged 212
mmcfd of natural gas and 35 mbbld of crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids  fourth quarter 2004 net production of 234
mmcfd of natural gas and 40 mbbld of crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids was a 20 increase over fourth quarter 2003
net production of 195 mmcfd of natural gas and 34 mbbld of crude
oil condensate and natural gas liquids which included
production from properties acquired in the fourth quarter of
2003  key producing areas in the western canadian sedimentary
basin are the southeast albertasouthwest saskatchewan shallow
natural gas trend as well as the drumheller twining and grande
prairiewapiti areas of central alberta  eogrc expects a similar
level of shallow natural gas drilling in 2005 on its expanded
southeast alberta platform including the development of
horseshoe canyon dry coalbed methane at twining  eog also plans
to participate in several higher impact exploratory tests in
alberta and the northwest territories during 2005

     at december 31 2004 eog held approximately 1427800 net
undeveloped acres in canada

  operations outside the united states and canada

     eog has operations offshore trinidad and the united kingdom
north sea and is evaluating additional exploration exploitation
and development opportunities in the united kingdom trinidad and
other international areas

     trinidad  in november 1992 eog through its subsidiary
eog resources trinidad limited eogrt acquired a 95 working
interest subject to a 5 overriding royalty interest in the
south east coast consortium secc block offshore trinidad
encompassing three undeveloped fields  the kiskadee ibis and
oilbird fields  the parula field was discovered in 2002 and
commenced production in 2004  the kiskadee and ibis fields have
been developed and are being produced  eog is currently
developing the oilbird field and expects first production in
early 2007  the term of the license covering the secc block
expires in december 2029  effective february 3 2005 eogs
working interest was reduced to 80 due to conversion of the
overriding royalty interest  during 2004 average net production
from the secc block was 116 mmcfd of natural gas and 22 mbbld of
crude oil and condensate

     in the fourth quarter of 2004 eog through eogrt and its
secc partners signed a farm in agreement with bp trinidad and
tobago llc covering the deep ibis prospect on the secc block  bp
will pay the entire cost for drilling the well which is
anticipated to spud in late 2005  eog will retain a 506
interest in the prospect and will develop the prospect if
successful

     in july 1996 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidadua block limited signed a production sharing contract
with the government of trinidad and tobago for the modified ua
block where eog holds a 100 working interest the osprey field
was discovered in 1998 and commenced production in 2002  during
2004 average net production from the ua block was 70 mmcfd of
natural gas and 14 mbbld of condensate

     existing surplus processing and transportation capacity at
the pelican field facilities owned and operated by a subsidiary
of eogrts partners in the secc block is being used to process
and transport much of eogs natural gas production and all of its
condensate and crude oil production from the secc and ua
blocks condensate and crude oil from eogs trinidad operations
are being sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago

                                  3


     in april 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidadlrl unlimited signed a production sharing contract with
the government of trinidad and tobago for the lower reverse l
block which is adjacent to the secc block  eog holds a 100
working interest in the lower reverse l block  in the fourth
quarter of 2003 eog drilled the first exploration well lrl 1
on this block  the well was determined to be noncommercial in
november 2004 eog drilled the lrl 2 well which encountered
approximately 130 feet of net pay  in december 2004 the lrl 3
exploratory well was drilled and determined to be a dry hole

     in october 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidad ub block unlimited signed a production sharing
contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the
modified ub block which is also adjacent to the secc block
eog holds a 55 working interest in and operates the modified
ub block  primera oil  gas ltd a trinidadian company holds
the remaining 45 working interest  in september 2004 eog
drilled the first exploration well on this block and the well
was determined to be noncommercial

     at december 31 2004 eog held approximately 191600 net
undeveloped acres in trinidad

     natural gas from eogs trinidad operations is being sold to
the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc under the
following arrangements

    under the first takeorpay contract which was scheduled to
     expire in 2008 natural gas was delivered to ngc for resale to
     trinidad local markets  during 2004 eog delivered net average
     production of 116 mmcfd of natural gas under this agreement  in
     february 2005 the parties to the agreement executed an amended
     and restated takeorpay contract to replace the existing
     agreement  the new agreement among other things provides for a
     change in the pricing of wellhead natural gas volumes previously
     sold under a fixed price schedule with annual escalations
     prices are now partially dependent on caribbean ammonia index
     prices and methanol prices  the expiration date of the new
     agreement is december 31 2018

    under the second takeorpay contract which expires in
     2017 eog delivers to ngc approximately 60 mmcfd gross of
     natural gas which is resold to an anhydrous ammonia plant in
     point lisas trinidad that is owned and operated by caribbean
     nitrogen company limited cncl  during 2004 48 mmcfd of
     natural gas delivered to ngc was net to eog  cncl commenced
     production in june 2002 and currently produces approximately
     1850 metric tons of ammonia daily  eogrt owns a 12 equity
     interest in cncl  the other shareholders in cncl are ferrostaal
     ag clico energy company limited kbrdc cnc cayman ltd and
     koch cnc nevis llc  at december 31 2004 eogrts investment
     in cncl was 15 million  at december 31 2004 cncl had a long
     term debt balance of 203 million which is nonrecourse to
     cncls shareholders  as part of the financing for cncl the
     shareholders have entered into a postcompletion deficiency loan
     agreement with cncl to fund the costs of operations payment of
     principal and interest to the principal creditor and other cash
     deficiencies of cncl up to 30 million approximately 4 million
     of which is net to eogrts interest  the shareholders agreement
     requires the consent of the holders of 90 or more of the shares
     to take certain material actions accordingly given its current
     level of equity ownership eogrt is able to exercise significant
     influence over the operating and financial policies of cncl and
     therefore eog accounts for the investment using the equity
     method during 2004 eog recognized equity income of 5 million
     and received cash dividends of 5 million from cncl

                                  4


    under a fifteenyear takeorpay contract which expires in
     2019 eog supplies approximately 60 mmcfd gross of natural
     gas to ngc  during 2004 production under the contract
     averaged approximately 22 mmcfd of natural gas net to eog
     this gas is being resold by ngc to an anhydrous ammonia
     plant owned by nitrogen 2000 unlimited n2000 and located
     in point lisas trinidad  construction of the plant was
     completed in june 2004 at a total cost of 320 million and
     ammonia production commenced in august 2004  n2000
     currently produces approximately 1950 metric tons of
     ammonia daily  eogs subsidiary eog resources nitro2000
     ltd eognitro2000 owned a 23 equity interest in n2000 at
     december 31 2004  the other shareholders in n2000 are fs
     petrochemicals st kitts limited ce limited kbrdc
     nitrogen 2000 st lucia ltd and koch n2000 nevis llc
     at december 31 2003 eognitro2000s equity interest and
     investment in n2000 was 27 and 20 million respectively
     in february 2004 a portion of eognitro2000s shareholdings
     was sold to one of the other shareholders  the sale did not
     result in any gain or loss  at december 31 2004
     eognitro2000s investment in n2000 was 26 million  at
     december 31 2004 n2000 had a longterm debt balance of
     228 million which is nonrecourse to n2000s shareholders
     as part of the loan agreement for the n2000 financing
     affiliates of the shareholders have entered into a post
     completion deficiency loan agreement with n2000 to fund the
     costs of operations payment of principal and interest to
     the principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of n2000
     up to 30 million approximately 7 million of which is to
     be provided by the immediate parent company of eognitro2000
     the shareholders agreement requires the consent of the
     holders of 100 of the shares to take certain material
     actions  accordingly given its current level of equity
     ownership eognitro2000 is able to exercise significant
     influence over the operating and financial policies of n2000
     and therefore eog accounts for the investment using the
     equity method  during 2004 eog recognized equity income of
     6 million from n2000

     in february 2005 a portion of eognitro2000s shareholdings
     was sold to a subsidiary of one of the other shareholders
     the sale resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 2 million
     eognitro2000s equity interest is now 10

development well 4916vb from the vampire platform in 2004 and
production commenced in the third quarter of 2004  eog delivered
net average production of approximately 7 mmcfd from the valkyrie
field in 2004

     in 2003 eoguk acquired a 30 nonoperating working interest
in a portion of blocks 531 and 532  these blocks are also
located in the southern gas basin of the north sea  eoguk

named the arthur field commenced production in january 2005

     in the first quarter of 2004 eoguk completed the drilling
of an exploration well 492a5z  the well was determined to be
noncommercial

     in the second half of 2004 eoguk drilled its first operated
well 49219z in the viper prospect  the well was abandoned as
a dry hole

marketing

     wellhead marketing  eogs united states and canada wellhead
natural gas production is currently being sold on the spot market
and under longterm natural gas contracts at marketresponsive
prices  in many instances the longterm contract prices closely
approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the
spot market  wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad in 2004
were sold under either a contract with a fixed price schedule
with annual escalations or a contract that is price dependent on
caribbean ammonia index prices  beginning in 2005 wellhead
natural gas volumes from trinidad will be sold under contracts
with prices which are either wholly or partially dependent on
caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol prices  in the
united kingdom wellhead natural gas production is currently
being sold on the spot market

     substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate
is sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive
prices

     during 2004 sales to an integrated oil and gas company with
investment grade credit ratings accounted for 12 of eogs oil
and gas revenues  no other individual purchaser accounted for
10 or more of eogs oil and gas revenues for the same period
eog does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser will
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of eog

competition

     eog competes for reserve acquisitions and
explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions
frequently against companies with substantially larger financial
and other resources  to the extent eogs exploration budget is
lower than that of certain of its competitors eog may be
disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves
leases licenses and concessions  competitive factors include
price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline
connection times and distribution efficiencies  in addition eog
faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as
liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other
countries

regulation

     united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil
production  natural gas and crude oil production operations are
subject to various types of regulation including regulation in
the united states by state and federal agencies

     united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry
is under constant review for amendment or expansion  also
numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are
authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and
regulations which among other things require permits for the
drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the
waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through
proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and
regulate environmental and safety matters  the regulatory burden
on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business
and consequently affects its profitability

     a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in utah
wyoming and the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas
are granted by the federal government and administered by the
bureau of land management blm and the minerals management
service mms both federal agencies  operations conducted by
eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous
statutory and regulatory restrictions concerning the above and
other matters  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to
appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

     blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms
requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case
of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental
shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such
offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory
requirements including the need for prior mms approval for
exploration development and production plans stringent
engineering and construction specifications applicable to
offshore production facilities regulations restricting the
flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the
plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all
production facilities  under certain circumstances the mms may
require operations on federal leases to be suspended or
terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely
affect eogs interests

     in 2002 the dc circuit reversed a 2000 district court
decision and upheld a 1997 mms gas valuation rule categorically
denying allowances for postproduction marketing costs such as
longterm storage fees and marketer fees however the dc
circuit decision expressly allows firm demand charges to be
deducted  two trade associations had sought judicial review of
the 1997 gas valuation rule and procured a favorable district
court decision however the dc circuit decision and denial of
certorari by the supreme court ended the litigation in early
2003  in early 2005 the mms is expected to publish a further
revision to its gas valuation rule  the 2005 gas rule revision
will clarify the deductibility of transportation costs and adopt
the 2004 oil valuation rules cost of capital approach described
below  the revisions are not expected to reflect any major
changes  eog cannot predict what effect these changes will have
on eog operations but nothing significant is anticipated

     in 2004 the mms further amended its royalty regulations
governing the valuation of crude oil produced from federal
leases  the mmss 2000 oil valuation rule had replaced a set of
valuation benchmarks based on posted prices and comparable sales
with an indexing system based on spot prices at nearby market
centers  among other things the 2000 oil valuation rule like
the 1997 gas valuation rule also categorically disallowed
deductions for postproduction marketing costs  two industry
trade associations sought judicial review of the 2000 oil rule
but voluntarily dismissed their suit after late 2002 negotiations
led the mms to amend its oil valuation rule further in 2004  the
amended rule retained indexing for valuation but replaced spot
prices with nymex future prices except in the rocky mountain
region and california  the 2004 oil valuation rule also
liberalized allowances for nonarms length transportation
arrangements by increasing the multiplier used for calculating
the cost of capital  while the 2000 oil valuation rule was
likely to increase eogs royalty obligation somewhat the 2004
oil valuation rule is likely to attenuate that increase

                                  8


     sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by
eog are made at unregulated market prices

     the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act
of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa
these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory
commission ferc  effective january 1 1993 the natural gas
wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for
all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog
of its own production  all other sales of natural gas by eog
such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain
jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under
the nga which has flexible terms and conditions  consequently
all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market
prices subject to applicable contract provisions  eogs
jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future
possibility of greater federal oversight including the
possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more
restrictive conditions on such sales

     eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas
pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc
has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not
subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga  state regulation of
gathering facilities generally includes various safety
environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take
requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation
eogs gathering operations could be adversely affected should
they be subject in the future to the application of state or
federal regulation of rates and services

     eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become
subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the
design installation testing construction operation
replacement and management of facilities  additional rules and
legislation pertaining to these matters are considered andor
adopted from time to time  although eog cannot predict what
effect if any such legislation might have on its operations
the industry could be required to incur additional capital
expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative
and regulatory changes

     proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas
industry are considered from time to time by congress the state
legislatures the ferc the state regulatory commissions and the
federal and state courts eog cannot predict when or whether any
such proposals or proceedings may become effective  it should
also be noted that the natural gas industry historically has been
very heavily regulated therefore there is no assurance that the
less regulated approach currently being pursued by the ferc will
continue indefinitely

     environmental regulation  united states  various federal
state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of
materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs
as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil
exploration development and production operations and could
cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs
in connection with a release of regulated substances including
crude oil into the environment  in addition eog has acquired
certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions
with respect to the management and disposal or release of
hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control  under
environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to
remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior
owners or operators  in addition eog could be responsible under
environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in
which eog owns an interest but is not the operator  compliance
with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of
business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs
operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based
on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the
near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to
its total exploration and development expenditure program in
order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but
inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog
is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance eog also
could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it
sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent
equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or
other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such
sites

     canadian regulation of natural gas and crude oil production
the crude oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to
extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of
government  these regulatory authorities may impose regulations
on or otherwise intervene in the oil and natural gas industry
with respect to prices taxes transportation rates the
exportation of the commodity and possibly expropriation or
cancellation of contract rights  such regulations may be changed
from time to time in response to complaints or economic or
political conditions  the implementation of new regulations or
the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and
natural gas industry could reduce demand for these commodities
increase eogs costs and may have a material adverse impact on
its operations

                                  9


     it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations
will affect eog operations in a manner materially different than
they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size
eog is unable to predict what additional legislation or
amendments may be enacted

     in addition each province has regulations that govern land
tenure royalties production rates and other matters  the
royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of
crude oil and natural gas production  royalties payable on
production from private lands are determined by negotiations
between the mineral owner and the lessee although production
from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and
royalties  crown royalties are determined by government
regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the
value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable
generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well
productivity geographical location field discovery date and the
type or quality of the petroleum product produced

     environmental regulation  canada  all phases of the crude
oil and natural gas industry in canada are subject to
environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of canadian
federal provincial and municipal laws and regulations  such
laws and regulations impose among other things restrictions
liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation
handling use storage transportation treatment and disposal of
hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills
releases and emissions of various substances to the environment
these laws and regulations also require that facility sites and
other properties associated with eogs operations be operated
maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of
applicable regulatory authorities  in addition new project or
changes to existing projects may require the submission and
approval of environmental assessments or permit applications
these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and the
clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on
activities that may affect the environment  while compliance
with such legislation can require significant expenditures
failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations
could result in the assessment of administrative civil or
criminal penalties suspension or revocation of licenses and in
some instances the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease
operations

     spills and releases from eogs properties may have resulted
or result in soil and groundwater contamination in certain
locations  such contamination is not unusual within the crude
oil and natural gas industries any contamination found on under
or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation
requirements under canadian laws  eog could be required to
remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior
owners or operators  in addition eog could be held responsible
for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is
not the operator

     in december 2002 the canadian federal government ratified
the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on
climate change which requires canada to reduce its greenhouse
gas emissions to 6 below 1990 levels over the 20082012 period
although the canadian government has not yet provided significant
guidance on how it intends to meet these reduction targets the
energy industry has been identified as one of the areas that will
be affected  the final rules once known could affect
operations and profitability

     other international regulation  eogs exploration and
production operations outside the united states and canada are
subject to various types of regulations imposed by the respective
governments of the countries in which eogs operations are
conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that
country  eog currently has operations in trinidad and the united
kingdom

                                  10


other matters

     energy prices  since eog is primarily a natural gas
producer it is more significantly impacted by changes in prices
for natural gas than in prices for crude oil condensate or
natural gas liquids  average united states and canada wellhead
natural gas prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically
during the last three years  these fluctuations resulted in a
32 decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price for
production in the united states and canada received by eog from
2001 to 2002 an increase of 75 from 2002 to 2003 and an
increase of 12 from 2003 to 2004  wellhead natural gas volumes
from trinidad in 2004 were sold under either a contract with a
fixed price schedule with annual escalations or a contract that
is price dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices  beginning
in 2005 wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad will be sold
under contracts with prices which are either wholly or partially
dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices andor methanol
prices  in the united kingdom wellhead natural gas production
is currently being sold on the spot market  crude oil and
condensate prices also have fluctuated during the last three
years due to the many uncertainties associated with the world
political environment the availabilities of other world wide
energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the
various energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to
predict what changes may occur in natural gas crude oil and
condensate and ammonia prices in the future

     assuming a totally unhedged position for 2005 based on
eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural
gas volumes for 2005 for which prices have not been determined
under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for
each 010 per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price
is approximately 21 million for net income and operating cash
flow  eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil
prices  eogs price sensitivity for each 100 per barrel change
in average wellhead crude oil price is approximately 65 million
for net income and operating cash flow  summarized below and in
note 11 to the consolidated financial statements is information
regarding eogs 2005 natural gas hedge position

     risk management  eog engages in price risk management
activities from time to time  these activities are intended to
manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for
natural gas and crude oil  eog utilizes derivative financial
instruments primarily price swaps and collars as the means to
manage this price risk  in addition to these financial
transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity
contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods
of time and have varying pricing provisions  under statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 133  accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by
sfas nos 137 138 and 149 these various physical commodity
contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales
exception and therefore are not subject to hedge accounting or
marktomarket accounting  the financial impact of these various
physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time
of settlement which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon
prices

item 2  properties

oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves

     reserve information  for estimates of eogs net proved and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including
crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental
information to consolidated financial statements

     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures including many
factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set
forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial
statements represent only estimates  reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount
and quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment  as a result estimates of different
engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate upward or downward
accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the
quantities ultimately recovered  the meaningfulness of such
estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the
assumptions upon which they were based

     in general production from eogs oil and gas properties
declines as reserves are depleted except to the extent eog
acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or
conducts successful exploration exploitation and development
activities the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves
are produced  volumes generated from future activities of eog
are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in
finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred
in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed with other federal
agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental
information to consolidated financial statements

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations

overview

     eog resources inc eog is one of the largest independent
nonintegrated oil and natural gas companies in the united
states with substantial proved reserves in the united states
canada offshore trinidad and to a lesser extent the united
kingdom north sea  eog operates under a consistent business and
operational strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a
strong reinvestment rate of return drilling internally generated
prospects delivering longterm production growth and maintaining
a strong balance sheet with a below average debttototal
capitalization ratio

     eog had another year of record operating earnings in 2004
net income available to common for 2004 of 614 million was up
47 over 2003 earnings of 419 million attributable primarily to
higher commodity prices and increased production  at december
31 2004 eogs total reserves were 56 trillion cubic feet
equivalent an increase of 430 billion cubic feet equivalent
bcfe or 8 higher than 2003

  operations

     several important developments have occurred since january 1
2004

     united states and canada  during 2004 eog opened a new
office in fort worth texas to expand its drilling success in the
barnett shale play of the fort worth basin  eog made significant
gas discoveries in the noncore portion of the trend located
south and west of the city of fort worth  eog plans to focus on
increasing production and further defining the plays ultimate
size during 2005

     eogs effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential
has proven a successful supplement to its base development and
exploitation program in the united states and canada  eog plans
to continue to drill smaller wells in large acreage plays which
in the aggregate will contribute substantially to eogs crude oil
and natural gas production  eog has several larger potential
plays under way in wyoming utah texas oklahoma and western
canada

     international  in mid2004 eog began natural gas sales to
the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc under a
fifteenyear takeorpay contract  this gas is being resold by
ngc to an anhydrous ammonia plant located in point lisas
trinidad  the plant is owned by nitrogen 2000 unlimited
n2000  at december 31 2004 eogs subsidiary eog resources
nitro2000 ltd owned an approximate 23 equity interest in
n2000  under the contract eog supplies approximately 60 million
cubic feet per day mmcfd gross of natural gas to ngc

     although eog continues to focus on united states and canada
natural gas eog sees an increasing linkage between united states
and canada natural gas demand and trinidadian natural gas supply
for example liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing
and planned facilities in trinidad are serious contenders to meet
increasing united states demand  in addition ammonia methanol
and chemical production has been relocating from the united
states and canada to trinidad driven by attractive natural gas
feedstock prices in the island nation  eog anticipates that its
existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia
plants and the new methanol plant will continue to give its
portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada
natural gas fundamentals

     in 2004 eog continued its progress in the southern gas
basin of the united kingdom north sea  a development well was
drilled in the valkyrie field and commenced production in august
2004  in addition the production facilities were installed in
the arthur field which was discovered in 2003 and production
commenced in january 2005  eog continues to review additional
opportunities in this area and expects to participate in several
exploration wells in 2005

                                  19


  capital structure

     as noted one of managements key strategies is to keep a
strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debtto
total capitalization ratio  at december 31 2004 eogs debtto
total capitalization ratio was 27 down from 33 at yearend
2003  by primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating
activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004 eog
funded its 15 billion exploration and development expenditures
paid down 31 million of debt redeemed all 500 outstanding
shares of series d preferred stock for 50 million and increased
the dividend paid to common shareholders by 20  in addition in
2005 eogs board of directors increased the quarterly cash
dividend on common stock by 33  as management currently
assesses price forecast and demand trends for 2005 eog believes
that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially
be funded by cash from operations

     for 2005 eogs estimated exploration and development
expenditure budget is approximately 16 billion excluding
acquisitions united states and canada natural gas continues to
be a key component of this effort  when it fits eogs strategy
eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling
programs or offer eog incremental exploration andor production
opportunities  management continues to believe eog has one of
the strongest prospect inventories in eogs history

     the following review of operations for each of the three
years in the period ended december 31 2004 should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and
notes thereto beginning with page f1

                                  20


results of operations

  net operating revenues

     during 2004 net operating revenues increased 527 million
to 2271 million  total wellhead revenues which are revenues
generated from sales of natural gas crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids from producing wells increased 27 to 2301
million as compared to 1818 million in 2003  natural gas
revenues consists of natural gas wellhead revenues and revenues
from marketing activities associated with the sales and purchases
of natural gas  revenues from natural gas marketing activities
were 2 million for each of 2004 and 2003  crude oil condensate
and natural gas liquids revenues represent solely wellhead
revenues for these products  wellhead volume and price
statistics for the years ended december 31 were as follows

     2004 compared to 2003  wellhead natural gas revenues for
2004 increased 307 million or 20 to 1842 million from
1535 million for 2003 due to increases in natural gas
deliveries 134 million and the composite average wellhead
natural gas price 173 million  the composite average wellhead
natural gas price increased 10 to 486 per mcf for 2004 from
440 per mcf in 2003

     natural gas deliveries increased 81 mmcf per day or 8 to
1036 mmcf per day for 2004 from 955 mmcf per day in 2003 due to
a 47 mmcf per day or 28 increase in canada a 34 mmcf per day
or 22 increase in trinidad and a 7 mmcf per day increase in
the united kingdom due to commencement of production in august
2004 partially offset by a 7 mmcf per day or 1 decline in the
united states  the increased deliveries in canada 47 mmcf per
day were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the
fourth quarter of 2003 and additional production related to post
acquisition drilling  the increase in trinidad was attributable
to the increased production from the ua block 22 mmcf per day
which began supplying natural gas in mid2004 to the n2000
ammonia plant and commencement of production from the parula
wells on the secc block in february 2004 12 mmcf per day

     wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 149
million or 59 to 403 million from 254 million as compared to
2003 due to increases in both the composite average wellhead
crude oil and condensate price 103 million and the wellhead
crude oil and condensate deliveries 46 million  the composite
average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2004 was
4022 per barrel compared to 2992 per barrel for 2003

     wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased 42
mbbl per day or 18 to 274 mbbl per day from 232 mbbl per day
for 2003  the increase was mainly due to production from new
wells in the united states 26 mbbl per day and higher
production in trinidad from the parula wells 08 mbbl per day
and from the ua block as a result of new production 04 mbbl
per day

     natural gas liquids revenues were 26 million higher than a
year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries 14 million
and the composite average price 12 million

     during 2004 eog recognized losses on marktomarket
commodity derivative contracts of 33 million which included
realized losses of 82 million and collar premium payments of 1
million  during 2003 eog recognized losses on marktomarket
commodity derivative contracts of 80 million which included
realized losses of 45 million and collar premium payments of 3
million

     2003 compared to 2002  wellhead natural gas revenues for
2003 increased 657 million or 75 due to increases in the
composite average wellhead natural gas price and natural gas
deliveries  the composite average wellhead price for natural gas
increased 69 to 440 per mcf for 2003 from 260 per mcf in
2002

     natural gas deliveries increased to 955 mmcf per day for
2003 from 924 mmcf per day for the comparable period in 2002
the overall increase in natural gas deliveries was primarily due
to an increase in canada of 7 to 165 mmcf per day and an
increase in trinidad of 13 to 152 mmcf per day in 2003  the 7
or 11 mmcf per day increase in canada was primarily attributable
to a major property acquisition in the fourth quarter  the 13
or 17 mmcf per day increase in trinidad was attributable to a
full year of sales to the cncl ammonia plant versus only six
months of sales in 2002

     natural gas marketing activities increased natural gas
revenues by 2 million and 37 million for 2003 and 2002
respectively

     wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased 45
million or 22 due to increases in the composite average
wellhead crude oil and condensate price the composite average
wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2003 was 2992 per
barrel compared to 2456 per barrel for 2002

     natural gas liquids revenues were 11 million higher than a
year ago primarily due to a 50 increase in the composite average
price and a 3 increase in deliveries

     during 2003 eog recognized losses on marktomarket
commodity derivative contracts of 80 million which included
realized losses of 45 million and collar premium payments of 3

  operating and other expenses

     2004 compared to 2003  during 2004 operating expenses of
1292 million were 245 million higher than the 1047 million
incurred in 2003  the following table presents the costs per
mcfe for the years ended december 31

     the higher perunit rates of lease and well dda and taxes
other than income for 2004 compared to 2003 were due primarily to
the reasons set forth below

     lease and well expenses of 271 million were 58 million
higher than 2003 due primarily to a general increase in service
costs related to increased operating activities including an
increase in the number of wells in the united states 18
million canada 16 million and trinidad 1 million
increased transportation related costs in the united states 14
million canada 2 million and the united kingdom 2
million and changes in the canadian exchange rate 5 million

     depreciation depletion and amortization dda expenses of
504 million increased 63 million from 2003 due primarily to
increased production in canada 18 million the united states
10 million and trinidad 4 million the commencement of
production in the united kingdom 2 million increased dda
rates in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase
in production from higher cost properties 13 million
increased dda rates in canada mainly from developing acquired
proved reserves 8 million and changes in the canadian
exchange rate 7 million

     general and administrative ga expenses of 115 million
were 15 million higher than 2003 due primarily to expanded
operations

     taxes other than income of 134 million were 48 million
higher than 2003 due primarily to a decrease in credits taken
against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of
additional wells for a texas high cost gas severance tax
exemption 19 million an increase as a result of higher
wellhead revenues in the united states 13 million trinidad
2 million and canada 1 million higher property taxes as a
result of higher property valuation in the united states 6
million the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the
first quarter of 2004 5 million and an increase in the number
of wells and facilities in canada 2 million

     exploration costs of 94 million were 18 million higher
than 2003 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical
expenditures in the united states 6 million canada 3
million the united kingdom 3 million and trinidad 1
million and increased exploration administrative expenses
across eog 4 million

     impairments of 82 million were 8 million lower than 2003
due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the
united states 10 million partially offset by higher
amortization of unproved leases in canada 2 million  total
impairments under statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of
longlived assets were 25 million in each of 2004 and 2003

     net interest expense of 63 million was 4 million higher
than 2003 due primarily to a slightly higher average debt
balance

     other income expense net for 2004 included income from
equity investments of 11 million gains on sales of reserves and
related assets of 6 million and foreign currency transaction
losses of 7 million as a result of applying the changes in the
canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany shortterm loans
that eliminate in consolidation

                                  23


     income tax provision increased 85 million to 301 million
compared to 2003 primarily resulting from higher income before
income taxes 95 million and an increase in state income taxes
2 million offset by lower deferred income taxes associated
with the alberta canada corporate tax rate 5 million and
lower effective foreign income tax rates 2 million  as a
result of these changes the net effective tax rate for 2004
remained unchanged from the 2003 rate of 33

     in november 2003 canada enacted legislation reducing the
canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource
sector from 28 to 27 for 2003 with further reductions to 21
phased in over the next four years  this legislation also made
changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource
allowance  beginning in 2003 canadian taxpayers are allowed to
deduct 10 of actual provincial and other crown royalties  this
percentage increases each year through 2007 at which time 100
of crown royalties will be deductible  the resource allowance a
statutory deduction calculated as 25 of adjusted resource
profits will be phased out through 2007 when the deduction will
be completely eliminated

     2003 compared to 2002  during 2003 operating expenses of
1047 million were 133 million higher than the 914 million
incurred in 2002  the following table presents the costs per
mcfe for the years ended december 31



                                      2003      2002

            total perunit costs      220     200



     the higher perunit rates of lease and well dda ga and
taxes other than income for 2003 compared to 2002 were due
primarily to the reasons set forth below

     lease and well expenses of 213 million were 33 million
higher than 2002 due primarily to a general increase in service
costs related to increased operating activities including an
increase in the number of wells in the united states 15
million and canada 4 million increased lease and well
administrative expenses in the united states 7 million and
changes in the canadian exchange rate 6 million

     dda expenses of 442 million increased 44 million from the
prior year due primarily to more relative production from higher
cost properties in the united states 20 million and canada 5
million increased production in canada 3 million and
trinidad 2 million and changes in the canadian exchange rate
8 million also included in dda expenses for 2003 was 5
million of accretion expense related to sfas no 143 
accounting for asset retirement obligations

     ga expenses of 100 million were 11 million higher than
the period a year ago due primarily to expanded operations 9
million and increased insurance expense 5 million partially
offset by decreased legal costs 3 million

     taxes other than income of 86 million were 14 million
higher than the prior year period primarily due to an increase of
approximately 35 million as a result of increased wellhead
revenues as previously discussed partially offset by 24 million
of severance tax credits from the qualification of wells for a
texas high cost gas severance tax exemption

     exploration costs of 76 million were 16 million higher
than a year ago due primarily to an increase in technical staff
costs across eog 7 million and increased geological and
geophysical expenditures in the united states 5 million and
trinidad 3 million

     impairments increased 21 million to 89 million compared to
a year ago due to higher amortization of unproved leases in the
united states 25 million  total impairments under sfas no
144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets for 2003 and 2002 were 25 million and 30 million
respectively

                                  24


     other income expense net for 2003 included foreign
currency transaction gains of 9 million as a result of applying
the changes in the canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany
shortterm loans that eliminate in consolidation and income from
equity investments of 4 million

     income tax provision increased 184 million to 217 million
for 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily resulting from higher
income before income taxes for federal 187 million and state
4 million expiration of the tight gas sands federal income
tax credit as of december 31 2002 4 million and higher
effective foreign income tax rates 4 million primarily offset
by net tax benefit associated with the canadian tax law change
14 million

    on january 1 2003
2 pro forma total expenditures for 2002 are not presented since
    the pro forma application of sfas no 143 to the prior periods
    would not result in pro forma total expenditures materially
    different from the actual amounts reported



     exploration and development expenditures of 15 billion for
2004 were 190 million higher than the prior year due primarily
to increased drilling expenditures 439 million resulting from
higher exploration and development activities in canada and
trinidad and higher cost structures in the united states and
canada increased lease acquisitions in the united states 84
million primarily in the noncore barnett shale area and to a
lesser extent in south texas and changes in the canadian
exchange rate 20 million partially offset by decreased
property acquisitions 353 million  the higher cost structure
was primarily due to increases in materials and services across
the industry  the 2004 exploration and development expenditures
of 15 billion includes 1009 million in development 440
million in exploration 52 million in property acquisitions and
10 million in capitalized interest  the 2003 exploration and
development expenditures of 1321 million included 651 million
in development 256 million in exploration 405 million in
property acquisitions and 9 million in capitalized interest

     the level of exploration and development expenditures
including acquisitions will vary in future periods depending on
energy market conditions and other related economic factors  eog
has significant flexibility with respect to financing
alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and
development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant  there
are no material continuing commitments associated with current
expenditure plans

  financing

     eogs longterm debttototal capitalization ratio was 27
as of december 31 2004 compared to 33 as of december 31 2003

     during 2004 total longterm debt decreased 31 million to
1078 million see note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements  the estimated fair value of eogs longterm debt at
december 31 2004 and 2003 was 1146 million and 1175 million
respectively based upon quoted market prices and where such
prices were not available upon interest rates currently
available to eog at yearend  eogs debt is primarily at fixed
interest rates  at december 31 2004 a 1 decline in interest
rates would result in a 59 million increase in the estimated
fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements

     during 2004 eog utilized commercial paper and during 2003
eog utilized commercial paper and committed bank loans in
addition to operating cash flows to fund its operations  these
loans are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements  while eog maintains a 600 million
commercial paper program the maximum outstanding at any time
during 2004 was 321 million and the amount outstanding at
yearend was 92 million  eog considers this excess availability
which is contractually backed by the 600 million revolving
credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in
note 2 combined with the 688 million of availability under its
shelf registration described below to be ample to meet its
ongoing operating needs

     based on resources available at december 31 2004 during
2005 eog plans to replace the senior unsecured term loan facility
due 2005 with longterm debt  in 2004 the shortterm commercial
paper loan balance was reduced 6 million and the 100 million
650 notes were paid off by longterm debt refinancing

1 this table does not include the liability for
    dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and
    gas properties  effective with adoption of sfas no 143
    accounting for asset retirement obligations on january 1
    2003 eog recorded a separate liability for the fair value of
    this asset retirement obligation  see note 13 to the
    consolidated financial statements  in addition this table
    does not include eogs pension or postretirement benefit
    obligations  see note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements
2 commercial paper and the senior unsecured term loan
    facility due 2005 are classified as longterm debt on the
    consolidated balance sheets based on eogs intent and ability
    to ultimately replace such amounts with other longterm debt
    see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
3 amounts shown are based on current pipeline
    transportation rates and the canadian foreign currency
    exchange rate at december 31 2004  management does not
    believe that any future changes in these rates before the
    expiration dates of these commitments will have a material
    adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
    operations of eog



  shelf registration

     as of february 25 2005 the amount available under various
filed registration statements with the securities and exchange
commission for the offer and sale from time to time of eog debt
securities preferred stock andor common stock totaled 688
million

  offbalance sheet arrangements

     eog does not participate in financial transactions that
generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships  such entities often referred to as variable
interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe are
generally established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes  eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe
financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in
this document and has no intention to participate in such
transactions in the foreseeable future

  foreign currency exchange rate risk

     during 2004 eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange
rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries
including canada trinidad and the united kingdom  the foreign
currency most significant to eogs operations during 2004 was the
canadian dollar  while the continued strengthening of the
canadian dollar in 2004 impacted both the revenues and expenses
recorded on the income statements of eogs canadian subsidiaries
its impacts on the items were not to the same extent  since the
canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united
states prices the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate
have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian
expenses  eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange
rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business
and may implement measures to protect against the foreign
currency exchange rate risk

                                  28


     effective march 9 2004 eog entered into a foreign currency
swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange
rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the
canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements  eog accounts for the foreign
currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 133  accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by
sfas nos 137 138 and 149  under those provisions as of
december 31 2004 eog recorded the fair value of the swap of
231 million in other liabilities in the liabilities section of
the consolidated balance sheets  changes in the fair value of
the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to the
consolidated statements of income  the aftertax net impact from
the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative
change of 38 million for the year ended december 31 2004
this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income
in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance
sheets

  outlook

     natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this
volatility is expected to continue  uncertainty continues to
exist as to the direction of future united states and canada
natural gas and crude oil price trends and there remains a
rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the
industry  in eogs opinion overall natural gas production in
the united states is declining  in addition the increasing
recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly
source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand
being primarily a natural gas producer eog is more significantly
impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in
crude oil and condensate prices  longer term natural gas prices
will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as
well as the prices of competing fuels such as oil and coal

     assuming a totally unhedged position for 2005 based on
eogs tax position and the portion of eogs anticipated natural
gas volumes for 2005 for which prices have not been determined
under longterm marketing contracts eogs price sensitivity for
each 010 per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price
is approximately 21 million for net income and operating cash
flow  eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil
price  eogs price sensitivity for each 100 per barrel change
in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately 65
million for net income and operating cash flow  for information
regarding eogs natural gas hedge position as of december 31
2004 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

     marketing companies have played an important role in the
united states and canada natural gas market  these companies
aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers
like eog and then resell the gas to end users local distribution
companies or other buyers  in recent years several of the
largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy
or are having financial difficulty and others are exiting this
business  eog does not believe that this will have a material
effect on its ability to market its natural gas production  eog
continues to assess and monitor the credit worthiness of partners
to whom it sells its production and where appropriate to seek
new markets

     eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its
exploration and development expenditures in its major producing
areas in the united states and canada  however in order to
diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its
overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north
sea eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds
in the further development of opportunities outside the united
states and canada  in addition eog expects to conduct
exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states
and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for
involvement in other exploitation type opportunities  budgeted
2005 exploration and development expenditures excluding
acquisitions are approximately 16 billion and are structured
to maintain the flexibility necessary under eogs strategy of
funding the united states and canada exploration exploitation
development and acquisition activities primarily from available
internally generated cash flow

     the level of exploration and development expenditures may
vary in 2005 and will vary in future periods depending on energy
market conditions and other related economic factors  based upon
existing economic and market conditions eog believes net
operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2005
will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements
for the year  however eog has significant flexibility with
respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its
exploration exploitation development and acquisition
expenditure plans if circumstances warrant  while eog has
certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans
related to operations in the united states canada trinidad and
the united kingdom such commitments are not expected to be
material when considered in relation to the total financial
capacity of eog

                                  29


  environmental regulations

     various federal state and local laws and regulations
covering the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to protection of the environment affect eogs
operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas
and crude oil exploration development and production operations
and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective
action costs in connection with a release of regulated
substances including crude oil into the environment  in
addition eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from
third parties whose actions with respect to the management and
disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not
under eogs control  under environmental laws and regulations
eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of
or released by prior owners or operators  in addition eog could
be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil
and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the
operator  compliance with such laws and regulations increases
eogs overall cost of business but has not had a material
adverse effect on eogs operations or financial condition  it is
not anticipated based on current laws and regulations that eog
will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are
material in relation to its total exploration and development
expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws
and regulations but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are
frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of
compliance  eog also could incur costs related to the clean up
of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to
which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural
resources or other claims related to releases of regulated
substances at such sites

summary of critical accounting policies

    eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying
notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the united states of america which requires management to
make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes  eog identifies certain accounting policies
as critical based on among other things their impact on the
portrayal of eogs financial condition results of operations or
liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and
complexity in their deployment  critical accounting policies
cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because
the future resolution of such matters is unknown  management
routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of
each of the critical accounting policies  following is a
discussion of eogs most critical accounting policies

  proved oil and gas reserves

     eogs engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves which
directly impact financial accounting estimates including
depreciation depletion and amortization  proved reserves
represent estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic
and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were
made  the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas
reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective
decisions in the evaluation of all available geological
engineering and economic data for each reservoir  the data for a
given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a
result of numerous factors including but not limited to
additional development activity evolving production history and
continual reassessment of the viability of production under
varying economic conditions  consequently material revisions
upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from
time to time

  impairments

     oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when
incurred  unproved properties with individually significant
acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a
propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is
recognized  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are
not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of
such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical
experience is amortized over the average holding period  if the
unproved properties are determined to be productive the
appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas
properties  lease rentals are expensed as incurred

                                  30


     oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of
drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial
reserves  exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when
drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic
producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive
formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is
located offshore in the gulf of mexico  if proved commercial
reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed
in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved
commercial reserves have been found due to the requirement of a
significant capital investment  such exploratory drilling costs
may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is
sufficient to justify development when the investment is made and
additional exploratory wells are either in progress or firmly
planned  all other exploratory wells that do not meet these
criteria are expensed after one year  as of december 31 2004
and 2003 eog had exploratory drilling costs of 43 million and
45 million respectively related to an outside operated
deepwater offshore gulf of mexico discovery that has been
deferred for more than one year and will require significant
future capital expenditures before production can commence
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for
continued capitalization  as of december 31 2004 and 2003
there were no material exploratory drilling costs capitalized for
more than one year for projects that did not require a major
capital investment  costs to develop proved reserves including
the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in
the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized

     when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired
eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a
producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the
asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs
estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating
costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other
relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost
the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value  fair value is
calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate
riskadjusted discount rate

  depreciation depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties

     the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are
a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense
and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future
expense  holding all other factors constant if reserves were
revised upward or downward earnings would increase or decrease
respectively

     depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of
proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the
unitofproduction method  the reserve base used to calculate
depletion depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved
developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold
acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties  the
reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease
and well equipment costs which include development costs and
successful exploration drilling costs  estimated future
dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage
values are taken into account certain other assets are
depreciated on a straightline basis

     assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas
no 19  the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of
properties with a common geological structural feature or
stratigraphic condition such as a reservoir or field

     amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the
addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or
downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor
property dispositions and 4 impairments

  stock options

     eog accounts for stock options under the provisions and
related interpretations of accounting principles board apb
opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  no
compensation expense is recognized for such options  as allowed
by sfas no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation
issued in 1995 eog has continued to apply apb opinion no 25 for
purposes of determining net income and to present the pro forma
disclosures required by sfas no 123

                                  31


     in december 2002 the financial accounting standards board
fasb issued sfas no 148  accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb
statement no 123  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no
123r sharebased payment which supersedes sfas no 148
sfas no 123r establishes standards for transactions in which
an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award
this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using
the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no
25  sfas no 123r will be effective for interim or annual
reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2005  eog
currently expects to adopt sfas no 123r effective july 1 2005
using the modified prospective method  eog expects that the
adoption of sfas no 123r would reduce second half 2005 net
earnings by a pretax amount of approximately 10 million which
includes approximately 05 million for the employee stock
purchase plan  sfas no 123r also requires a public entity to
present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock
options exercised in the financing cash flows section of the
statement of cash flows  had sfas no 123r been in effect
eogs net cash provided by operating activities would have been
reduced and its net cash provided by financing activities would
have been increased on its consolidated statements of cash flows
by 29 million 12 million and 5 million for 2004 2003 and
2002 respectively

of changes in commodity prices for crude oil natural gas and
related products foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and
changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol the extent
and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by eog the
extent of eogs success in discovering developing marketing and
producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties the
accuracy of reserve estimates which by their nature involve the
exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise

and 15d15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of
1934 as amended exchange act as of the end of the period
covered by this report evaluation date  based on this
evaluation the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that eogs disclosure controls

     managements report on internal control over financial
reporting  eogs management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
as defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the
exchange act  even an effective internal control system no
matter how well designed has inherent limitations including the
possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of
controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to reliable financial reporting  furthermore the
effectiveness of an internal control system in future periods can
change with conditions

     eogs management assessed the effectiveness of eogs
internal control over financial reporting as of december 31
2004  in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth
by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework
based on this assessment management believes that as of
december 31 2004 eogs internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria  eogs assessment
also appears on page f2

     eogs independent auditors have issued an audit report on
eogs assessment of its internal control over financial
reporting  this report begins on page f3

resources inc and its subsidiaries eog were prepared by
management which is responsible for their integrity objectivity
and fair presentation  the statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and
accordingly include some amounts that are based on the best
estimates and judgments of management

     eogs management is also responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
the system of internal control of eog is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles  this system  consists of 1 entity level
controls including written policies and guidelines relating to
the ethical conduct of business affairs 2 general computer
controls and 3 process controls over initiating authorizing
recording processing and reporting transactions  even an
effective internal control system no matter how well designed
has inherent limitations including the possibility of human
error and circumvention or overriding of controls and therefore
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable
financial reporting  furthermore the effectiveness of an
internal control system in future periods can change with
conditions

     the adequacy of financial controls of eog and the accounting
principles employed in financial reporting by eog are under the
general oversight of the audit committee of the board of
directors  no member of this committee is an officer or employee
of eog  the independent public accountants and internal auditors
have full free separate and direct access to the audit
committee and meet with the committee from time to time to
discuss accounting auditing and financial reporting matters

     eogs management assessed the effectiveness of eogs
internal control over financial reporting as of december 31
2004  in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth
by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission coso in internal control  integrated framework
these criteria cover the control environment risk assessment
process control activities information and communication
systems and monitoring activities  based on this assessment

control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria

     report of independent registered public accounting firm

to the board of directors and stockholders of
eog resources inc
houston texas

     we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of eog resources inc and subsidiaries the company as of
december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income shareholders
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended december 31 2004  our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at item 15  we also have
audited managements assessment included in the accompanying
managements responsibility for financial reporting that the
company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established
in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee
of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  the
companys management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedules for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting  our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedules
an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits

     we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the public company accounting oversight board united states
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects  our audit of financial
statements included examining on a test basis evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation  our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting
evaluating managements assessment testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances  we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions

     a companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by or under the supervision of the companys
principal executive and principal financial officers or persons
performing similar functions and effected by the companys board
of directors management and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america  a companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements

     because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis  also projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate

                                  f3


     in our opinion the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly in all material respects the
financial position of the company as of december 31 2004 and
2003 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america  also in our opinion such financial
statement schedules when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein  also in our opinion managements assessment that the
company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all
material respects based on the criteria established in internal
controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
furthermore in our opinion the company maintained in all
material respects effective internal control over financial
reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria
established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission

           notes to consolidated financial statements


1  summary of significant accounting policies

     principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial
statements of eog resources inc eog include the accounts of
all domestic and foreign subsidiaries  investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in which eog is able to exercise
significant influence are accounted for using the equity method
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of
america requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period  actual results could
differ from those estimates

     certain reclassifications have been made to prior period
financial statements to conform with the current presentation

     financial instruments  eogs financial instruments consist
of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities commodity
derivative contracts accounts receivable accounts payable and
longterm debt  the carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents marketable securities commodity derivative
contracts accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value see note 2 for fair value of longterm debt

     cash and cash equivalents  eog records as cash equivalents
all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities
of three months or less

     oil and gas operations  eog accounts for its natural gas
and crude oil exploration and production activities under the
successful efforts method of accounting

     oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when
incurred  unproved properties with individually significant
acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a
propertybyproperty basis and any impairment in value is
recognized  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are
not individually significant are aggregated and the portion of
such costs estimated to be nonproductive based on historical
experience is amortized over the average holding period  if the
unproved properties are determined to be productive the
appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas
properties lease rentals are expensed as incurred

     oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of
drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial
reserves  exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when
drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic
producibility supported by either actual production a conclusive
formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is
located offshore in the gulf of mexico  if proved commercial
reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed
in some circumstances it may be uncertain whether proved
commercial reserves have been found due to the requirement of a
significant capital investment  such exploratory drilling costs
may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is
sufficient to justify development when the investment is made and
additional exploratory wells are either in progress or firmly
planned  all other exploratory wells that do not meet these
criteria are expensed after one year  as of december 31 2004
and 2003 eog had exploratory drilling costs of 43 million and
45 million respectively related to an outside operated
deepwater offshore gulf of mexico discovery that has been
deferred for more than one year and will require significant
future capital expenditures before production can commence
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for
continued capitalization  as of december 31 2004 and 2003
there were no material exploratory drilling costs capitalized for
more than one year for projects that did not require a major
capital investment  costs to develop proved reserves including
the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in
the production of natural gas and crude oil are capitalized

                                  f9


     depreciation depletion and amortization of the cost of
proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the
unitofproduction method  the reserve base used to calculate
depletion depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved
developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold
acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties  the
reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease
and well equipment costs which include development costs and
successful exploration drilling costs  estimated future
dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs net of salvage
values are taken into account certain other assets are
depreciated on a straightline basis

     assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 19  the
basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with
a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic
condition such as a reservoir or field

     amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect 1 the
addition of capital costs 2 reserve revisions upwards or
downwards and additions 3 property acquisitions andor
property dispositions and 4 impairments

     eog accounts for impairments under the provisions of sfas
no 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long
lived assets  when circumstances indicate that an asset may be
impaired eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at
a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of
the asset  if the future undiscounted cash flows based on eogs
estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating
costs anticipated production from proved reserves and other
relevant data are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost
the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value  fair value is
calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate
riskadjusted discount rate

     inventories consisting primarily of tubular goods and well
equipment held for use in the exploration for and development and
production of natural gas and crude oil reserves are carried at
cost with adjustments made from time to time to recognize any
reductions in value

     arrangements for natural gas crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids sales are evidenced by signed contracts with
determinable market prices and are recorded when production is
delivered  a significant majority of the purchasers of these
products have investment grade credit ratings and material credit
losses have been rare  revenues are recorded on the entitlement
method based on eogs percentage ownership of current production
each working interest owner in a well generally has the right to
a specific percentage of production although actual production
sold on that owners behalf may differ from that owners
ownership percentage  under entitlement accounting a receivable
is recorded when underproduction occurs and a payable is recorded
when overproduction occurs

     capitalized interest costs  interest capitalization is
required for those properties if its effect compared with the
effect of expensing interest is material  accordingly certain
interest costs have been capitalized as a part of the historical
cost of unproved oil and gas properties  the amount capitalized
is an allocation of the interest cost incurred during the
reporting period  capitalized interest is computed only during
the exploration and development activities and not on proved
properties  the interest rate used for capitalization purposes
is based on the interest rates on eogs outstanding borrowings

     accounting for price risk management activities  eog
accounts for its price risk management activities under the
provisions of sfas no 133  accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137
138 and 149  the statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded
in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
its fair value  the statement requires that changes in the
derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  during the
three year period ending december 31 2004 eog elected not to
designate any of its price risk management activities as
accounting hedges under sfas no 133 and accordingly accounted
for them using the marktomarket accounting method  under this
accounting method the changes in the market value of outstanding
financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the
period of change  the gains or losses are recorded in gains
losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts  the
related cash flow impact is reflected as cash flows from
operating activities see note 11

                                  f10


     income taxes  eog accounts for income taxes under the
provisions of sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes sfas
no 109 requires the asset and liability approach for accounting
for income taxes  under this approach deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between financial
statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases see note 5

     foreign currency translation  for subsidiaries whose
functional currency is deemed to be other than the united states
dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at yearend
exchange rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the year  translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss  any gains or losses on transactions or monetary
assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional
currency are included in net income in the current period

     net income per share  in accordance with the provisions of
sfas no 128  earnings per share basic net income per share
is computed on the basis of the weightedaverage number of common
shares outstanding during the periods  diluted net income per
share is computed based upon the weightedaverage number of
common shares plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all
potentially dilutive securities see note 8 for additional
information to reconcile the difference between the average
number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted net
income per share

     stock options  eog accounts for stock options under the
provisions and related interpretations of accounting principles
board apb opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to
employees  no compensation expense is recognized for such
options  as allowed by sfas no 123  accounting for stock
based compensation issued in 1995 eog has continued to apply
apb opinion no 25 for purposes of determining net income and to
present the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 123

     eogs pro forma net income and net income per share of
common stock for 2004 2003 and 2002 had compensation costs been

     for grants made prior to august 2004 the fair value of each
option grant is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing
model with the following weightedaverage assumptions used for
grants in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 1 dividend yield
of 04 04 and 04 2 expected volatility of 35 43 and
45 3 riskfree interest rate of 25 34 and 37 and
4 expected life of 28 years 52 years and 53 years

                                  f11


     beginning in august 2004 eogs stock options contain a
feature that limits the potential gain that can be realized by
requiring vested options to be exercised if the market price
reaches 200 of the grant price for five consecutive trading days
capped option  the fair value of each capped option grant is
estimated using a monte carlo simulation model assuming a
dividend yield of 04 expected volatility of 31 riskfree
interest rate of 424 and a weightedaverage expected life of
483 years  during 2004 approximately 1377000 stock options
were granted at a weighted average fair value of 2106 and were
included in the above pro forma employee stock based compensation
expense calculation  approximately 200000 of the stock options
were granted before august 2004 with an average fair value of
1604 based on the blackscholes optionpricing model
approximately 1177000 of the stock options were granted with
the capped option feature since august 1 2004 with an average
fair value of 2191 based on the monte carlo simulation model
the average fair values for the stock options granted during 2003
and 2002 were 1655 and 1479 respectively

     the effects of applying sfas no 123 in this pro forma
disclosure should not be interpreted as being indicative of
future effects  sfas no 123 does not apply to awards prior to
1995 and the extent and timing of additional future awards
cannot be predicted

     new accounting pronouncements  in june 2001 the financial
accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 143 
accounting for asset retirement obligations effective for
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002  sfas no 143
essentially requires entities to record the fair value of a
liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs  eog adopted the statement on january 1 2003  the impact
of adopting the statement results in an aftertax charge of 71
million which was reported in the first quarter of 2003 as
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

     during the third quarter of 2003 the sec made comments to
other registrants that oil and gas mineral rights acquired should
be classified as an intangible asset pursuant to sfas no 141 
business combinations and sfas no 142  goodwill and other
intangible assets  on september 2 2004 fasb staff position
1422 application of fasb statement no 142 goodwill and
other intangible assets to oil and gasproducing entities was
issued  the fasb staff believes that the scope exception in
paragraph 8b of statement 142 extends to its disclosure
provisions for drilling and mineral rights of oil and gas
producing entities  accordingly the sec comments made to the
other registrants have no impact on eogs financial statements

     on april 1 2004 eog adopted prospectively fasb staff
position no 1062  accounting and disclosure requirements
related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and
modernization act of 2003 fsp 1062 which provides guidance
on accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug
improvement act of 2003 for employers that sponsor postretirement
health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits  the
adoption of fsp 1062 did not have a material impact on eogs
financial statements see note 6 for further information on eogs
postretirement plan

     on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004
the act was enacted  the act provides a deduction for income
from qualified domestic production activities which will be
phased in from 2005 through 2010  the act also provides for a
twoyear phase out of the existing extraterritorial income
exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be
inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european
union  eog expects the net effect of the phase out of the eti
and the phase in of this new deduction to result in favorable
adjustments to the effective tax rate for 2005 and subsequent
years  under the guidance in fasb staff position no 1091
application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income
taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities
provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the
deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described
in fasb 109  as such the special deduction has no effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment
date  rather the impact of this deduction will be reported in
the period in which the deduction is claimed on eogs tax return

                                  f12


     the act also creates a temporary incentive for united states
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain
dividends from controlled foreign corporations  the deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and currently uncertainty
remains as to how to interpret some provisions in the act  the
act limits the qualified dividends to the greater of 500 million
or the amount of earnings permanently reinvested outside the
united states as reported in the 2002 financial statements
which was 550 million  in addition a comprehensive analysis of
foreign legal and tax ramifications must be completed before such
dividends are declared  as such eog is not yet in a position to
decide on whether and to what extent it might repatriate
foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the united
states  eog expects to be in a position to complete the
assessment by september 30 2005

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148  accounting
for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure  an
amendment of fasb statement no 123  in december 2004 the fasb
issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which supersedes
sfas no 148  sfas no 123r establishes standards for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services  this standard requires a public entity to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an
award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of
the award  this eliminates the exception to account for such
awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb
opinion no 25  sfas no 123r will be effective for interim or
annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2005
eog currently expects to adopt sfas no 123r effective july 1
2005 using the modified prospective method  eog expects that the
adoption of sfas no 123r would reduce second half 2005 net
earnings by a pretax amount of approximately 10 million taking
into consideration the estimated forfeitures and cancellations
the amount includes approximately 05 million for the employee
stock purchase plan  sfas no 123r also requires a public
entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from
stock options exercised in the financing cash flows section of
the statement of cash flows  had sfas no 123r been in effect
eogs net cash provided by operating activities would have been
reduced and its net cash provided by financing activities would
have been increased on its consolidated statements of cash flows
by 29 million 12 million and 5 million for 2004 2003 and
2002 respectively see note 6 for further information on eogs
stockbased compensation plans

2  longterm debt

     longterm debt at december 31 consisted of the following in
thousands



                                                  2004          2003

     total                                     1077622   1108872



     during 2004 eog utilized commercial paper and during 2003
eog utilized commercial paper and shortterm funding from
uncommitted credit facilities both bearing market interest
rates for various corporate financing purposes  commercial
paper and uncommitted credit borrowings are classified as long
term debt based on eogs intent and ability to ultimately replace
such amounts with other longterm debt

                                  f13


     on july 23 2003 eog entered into a new threeyear
revolving credit agreement agreement with domestic and foreign
lenders which provides for 600 million in longterm committed
credit and concurrently cancelled the existing 300 million 364
day credit facility and 300 million fiveyear credit facility
scheduled to expire in july 2003 and july 2004 respectively
this agreement provides eog the ability to replace the commercial
paper uncommitted credit borrowing and any maturity of debt
advances under the agreement bear interest based upon a base rate
or a eurodollar rate at the option of eog  the agreement also
provides for the allocation at the option of eog of up to 75
million of the 600 million to its canadian subsidiary advances
to the canadian subsidiary should they occur would be
guaranteed by eog and would bear interest at the option of the
canadian subsidiary based upon a canadian prime rate or a
canadian bankers acceptance rate  eog also has the option to
issue up to 100 million in letters of credit as part of this
agreement  no amounts were borrowed under this agreement at
december 31 2004  the applicable base rates for this facility
had there been any amounts borrowed under this agreement would
have been 525 and 400 at december 31 2004 and december 31
2003 respectively  the applicable eurodollar rates for this
facility had there been any amounts borrowed under this
agreement would have been 290 and 162 at december 31 2004
and december 31 2003 respectively

     eog maintains a threeyear senior unsecured term loan
facility facility with a group of banks whereby the banks lent
eog 150 million with a maturity date of october 30 2005  this
facility calls for interest to be charged at a spread over libor
london interbank offering rate or the base rate at eogs
option and contains substantially the same covenants as those in
eogs 600 million longterm revolving credit agreement  on
march 31 2004 eog repaid 75 million of the 150 million loan
the remaining 75 million balance is classified as longterm debt
based on eogs intent and ability to ultimately replace such
amounts with other longterm debt  the applicable interest rates
for the facility were 317 and 188 at december 31 2004 and
december 31 2003 respectively

     on march 9 2004 under rule 144a of the securities act of
1933 as amended eog resources canada inc a wholly owned
subsidiary of eog issued notes with a total principal amount of
us150 million an annual interest rate of 475 and a maturity
date of march 15 2014  the notes are guaranteed by eog  in
conjunction with the offering eog entered into a foreign
currency swap transaction with multiple banks for the equivalent
amount of the notes and related interest which has in effect
converted this indebtedness into cad2013 million with a 5275
interest rate

     the 600 to 670 notes due 2006 to 2028 were issued
through public offerings and have effective interest rates of
616 to 681  the subsidiary debt due 2011 bears interest at a
fixed rate of 700 and is guaranteed by eog  the weighted
average interest rate for the commercial paper was 145 for
2004

     on september 15 2004 eog repaid in full upon maturity the
100 million 650 notes

     at december 31 2004 the aggregate annual maturities of
longterm debt were 75 million for 2005 127 million in 2006
100 million for 2007 174 million for 2008 and zero for 2009

     both eogs credit agreement and facility contain certain
restrictive covenants including a maximum debttototal
capitalization ratio of 65 and a minimum ratio of ebitdax
earnings before interest taxes dda and exploration expense
to interest expense of at least three times  other than these
covenants eog does not have any other financial covenants in its
financing agreements  eog continues to comply with these two
covenants and does not view them as materially restrictive

     shelf registration  as of february 25 2005 the amount
available under various filed registration statements with the
sec for the offer and sale from time to time of eog debt
securities preferred stock andor common stock totaled 688
million

     fair value of longterm debt  at december 31 2004 and
2003 eog had 1078 million and 1109 million respectively of
longterm debt which had fair values of approximately 1146
million and 1175 million respectively  the fair value of
longterm debt is the value eog would have to pay to retire the
debt including any premium or discount to the debtholder for
the differential between the stated interest rate and the
yearend market rate  the fair value of longterm debt is based
upon quoted market prices and where such quotes were not
available upon interest rates available to eog at yearend

                                  f14


3  shareholders equity

     common stock  eog purchases its common stock from time to
time in the open market to be held in treasury for among other
purposes fulfilling any obligations arising under eogs stock
plans and any other approved transactions or activities for which
such common stock shall be required  in september 2001 the
board of directors authorized the purchase of an aggregate
maximum of 10 million shares of common stock of eog which
superseded all previous authorizations  at december 31 2004
6386200 shares remain available for repurchases under this
authorization  on february 2 2005 eog announced that the board
of directors had approved a twoforone stock split in the form
of a stock dividend payable to record holders as of february 15
2005 and to be issued on march 1 2005  in addition the board

     on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004
the act was enacted  the act creates a temporary incentive for
united states corporations to repatriate accumulated income
earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction

deduction is subject to a number of limitations and currently
uncertainty remains as to how to interpret some provisions in the
act  the act limits the qualified dividends to the greater of
500 million or the amount of earnings permanently reinvested
outside the united states as reported in the 2002 financial
statements which was 550 million  in addition a comprehensive
analysis of foreign legal and tax ramifications must be completed

position to decide on whether and to what extent it might
repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to

the assessment by september 30 2005

     eogs foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings of
approximately 1 billion at december 31 2004 are considered to
be indefinitely invested outside the united states and
accordingly no united states or state income taxes have been
provided thereon  upon distribution of those earnings in the
form of dividends eog may be subject to both foreign withholding
taxes and united states income taxes net of allowable foreign
tax credits  determination of any potential amount of
unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities is not practicable

     eog incurred a tax net operating loss of 191 million in
2002  during 2003 eog utilized 176 million of the 2002 net
operating loss  the remaining net operating loss of 15 million
was utilized in 2004

     a foreign net operating loss of 80 million of which 55
million was incurred during 2004 will be carried forward
indefinitely until utilized

     eog had an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward
from prior years of 6 million which was used to offset regular
income taxes in 2004

11  price interest rate and credit risk management activities

     price and interest rate risks  eog engages in price risk
management activities from time to time  these activities are
intended to manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices for natural gas and crude oil  eog utilizes derivative
financial instruments primarily price swaps and collars as the
means to manage this price risk  in addition to these financial
transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity
contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods
of time and have varying pricing provisions  under sfas no 133
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 these various physical
commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal
sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge
accounting or marktomarket accounting  the financial impact of
these various physical commodity contracts is included in
revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average
realized hydrocarbon prices

     during 2004 2003 and 2002 eog elected not to designate any
of its derivative financial contracts as accounting hedges and
accordingly accounted for these derivative financial contracts
using marktomarket accounting  during 2004 eog recognized
losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 33
million which included realized losses of 82 million and collar
premium payments of 1 million  during 2003 eog recognized
losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 80
million which included realized losses of 45 million and collar
premium payments of 3 million  during 2002 eog recognized
losses on marktomarket commodity derivative contracts of 49
million which included realized losses of 21 million and a 2
million collar premium payment

financial collar contracts at december 31 2004 with prices
expressed in dollars per million british thermal units mmbtu
and notional volumes in million british thermal units per day
mmbtud  as indicated eog does not have any financial collar
or swap contracts that cover periods beyond march 2005
moreover eog has not entered into any additional natural gas
financial collar contracts or natural gas or crude oil financial
price swap contracts since december 31 2004  eog accounts for
these collar contracts using marktomarket accounting  the
total fair value of the natural gas financial collar contracts at
december 31 2004 was 11 million

     credit risk  while notional contract amounts are used to
express the magnitude of commodity price and interest rate swap
agreements the amounts potentially subject to credit risk in
the event of nonperformance by the other parties are
substantially smaller  eog evaluates its exposure to all
counterparties on an ongoing basis including those arising from
physical and financial transactions  in some instances eog
requires collateral parent guarantees or letters of credit to
minimize credit risk  at december 31 2004 eogs net accounts
receivable balance related to united states and canada
hydrocarbon sales included two receivable balances each of which
constituted 11 of the total balance  these receivables were due
from two integrated oil and gas companies  the related amounts
were collected during early 2005  the amounts due from an
integrated oil and gas company and a utility company at december
31 2003 which approximated 14 and 11 respectively of the
united states and canada net accounts receivable balance were
collected during early 2004  no other individual purchaser
accounted for 10 or more of the united states and canada net
accounts receivable balance at december 31 2004 and 2003  at
december 31 2004 eog had an allowance for doubtful accounts of
21 million of which 19 million is associated with the enron
bankruptcies recorded in december 2001

     substantially all of eogs accounts receivable at
december 31 2004 and 2003 result from hydrocarbon sales andor
joint interest billings to third party companies including
foreign stateowned entities in the oil and gas industry  this
concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact
eogs overall credit risk either positively or negatively in
that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions  in determining whether or not to
require collateral or other credit enhancements from a customer
or joint interest owner eog analyzes the entitys net worth
cash flows earnings and credit ratings  receivables are
generally not collateralized  during the threeyear period ended
december 31 2004 credit losses incurred on receivables by eog
have been immaterial

12  accounting for certain longlived assets

     eog reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment
purposes by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows
at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of
the asset  during 2004 2003 and 2002 such reviews indicated
that unamortized capitalized costs of certain properties were
higher than their expected undiscounted future cash flows due
primarily to downward reserve revisions for certain producing
fields  as a result during 2004 2003 and 2002 eog recorded in
impairments pretax charges of 17 million 21 million and 30
million respectively in the united states operating segment and
8 million 4 million and 0 respectively in the canada
operating segment  the carrying values for assets determined to
be impaired were adjusted to estimated fair values based on
projected future net cash flows discounted using eogs risk
adjusted discount rate  amortization expenses of acquisition
costs of unproved properties including amortization of
capitalized interest were 57 million 64 million and 38
million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

13  accounting for asset retirement obligations

     eog adopted sfas no 143  accounting for asset retirement
obligations on january 1 2003  the adoption of the statement
resulted in an aftertax charge of 71 million which was
reported in the first quarter of 2003 as cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle  the following table presents the
reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate carrying
amount of shortterm and longterm legal obligations associated
with the retirement of oil and gas properties pursuant to sfas

14  investment in caribbean nitrogen company limited and
nitrogen 2000 unlimited

     eog through certain wholly owned subsidiaries owns equity
interests in two trinidadian companies  caribbean nitrogen
company limited cncl and nitrogen 2000 unlimited n2000
during the first quarters of 2003 and 2004 eog completed
separate share sale agreements whereby a portion of the eog
subsidiaries shareholdings in cncl and n2000 was sold to a third
party energy company  the sales left eog with equity interests
of 12 in cncl and 23 in n2000 and did not result in any gain or
loss

     in february 2005 a portion of eogs shareholdings in
n2000 was sold to a subsidiary of one of the other shareholders
the sale resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 2 million
eogs equity interest in n2000 is now 10

     the other shareholders in cncl are ferrostaal ag clico
energy company limited kbrdc cnc cayman ltd and koch cnc
nevis llc  at december 31 2004 investment in cncl was 15
million  cncl commenced production in june 2002 and at december
31 2004 was producing approximately 1850 metric tons of
ammonia daily  at december 31 2004 cncl had a longterm debt
balance of 203 million which is nonrecourse to cncls
shareholders  eog will be liable for its share of any post
completion deficiency funds loans to fund the costs of
operation payment of principal and interest to the principal
creditor and other cash deficiencies of cncl up to 30 million
approximately 4 million of which is net to eogs interest  the
shareholders agreement requires the consent of the holders of
90 or more of the shares to take certain material actions
accordingly given its current level of equity ownership eog is
able to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of cncl and therefore it accounts for the
investment using the equity method  during 2004 eog recognized
equity income of 5 million and received cash dividends of 5
million from cncl

     the other shareholders in n2000 are fs petrochemicals st
kitts limited ce limited kbrdc nitrogen 2000 st lucia ltd
and koch n2000 nevis llc  at december 31 2004 investment in
n2000 was 26 million  n2000 commenced production in august
2004 and at december 31 2004 was producing approximately 1950
metric tons of ammonia daily  at december 31 2004 n2000 had a
longterm debt balance of 228 million which is nonrecourse to
n2000s shareholders  at december 31 2004 eog was liable for
its share of any postcompletion deficiency funds loans to fund
the costs of operation payment of principal and interest to the
principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of n2000 up to 30
million approximately 7 million of which is net to eogs
interest  the shareholders agreement requires the consent of
the holders of 100 of the shares to take certain material
actions  accordingly given its current level of equity
ownership eog is able to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of n2000 and therefore it
accounts for the investment using the equity method  during
2004 eog recognized equity income of 6 million

15  property acquisitions

     on october 1 2003 a canadian subsidiary of eog closed an
asset purchase of natural gas properties in the wintering hills
drumheller east and twining areas of southeast alberta from a
subsidiary of husky energy inc for approximately us320 million
these properties are essentially adjacent to existing eog
operations or are properties in which eog already had a working
interest  the transaction was partially funded by commercial
paper borrowings of us1405 million on october 1 2003  the
remainder of the purchase price us1795 million was funded by
eogs available cash balance  subsequent to the closing the
purchase price was reduced by exercised preferential rights on
the properties which totaled approximately us5 million  in late
december 2003 a canadian subsidiary of eog closed another
property acquisition for us46 million

oil and gas producing activities

     the following disclosures are made in accordance with sfas
no 69  disclosures about oil and gas producing activities

     oil and gas reserves  users of this information should be
aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved
proved developed and proved undeveloped crude oil and natural
gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective
decisions in the evaluation of all available geological
engineering and economic data for each reservoir  the data for a
given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a
result of numerous factors including but not limited to
additional development activity evolving production history and
continual reassessment of the viability of production under
varying economic conditions  consequently material revisions
upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from
time to time  although every reasonable effort is made to ensure
that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate
assessments possible the significance of the subjective
decisions required and variances in available data for various
reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other
estimates presented in connection with financial statement
disclosures

     proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural
gas crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at
the time the estimates were made

     proved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be
recovered through wells and equipment in place and under
operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were
made

     proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected
to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required
for completion reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to
those drilling units offsetting productive units that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled  proved reserves
for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be
demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of
production from the existing productive formation  estimates for
proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for
which an application of fluid injection or other improved
recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have
been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same
reservoir

     canadian provincial royalties are determined based on a
graduated percentage scale which varies with prices and
production volumes  canadian reserves as presented on a net
basis assume prices and royalty rates in existence at the time
the estimates were made and eogs estimate of future production
volumes  future fluctuations in prices production rates or
changes in political or regulatory environments could cause eogs
share of future production from canadian reserves to be
materially different from that presented

  supplemental information to consolidated financial statements
                           continued


     estimates of proved and proved developed reserves at
december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were based on studies performed
by the engineering staff of eog for all reserves  opinions by
degolyer and macnaughton dm independent petroleum
consultants for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002
covered producing areas containing 77 72 and 73
respectively of proved reserves of eog on a netequivalentcubic
feetofgas basis  dms opinions indicate that the estimates of
proved reserves prepared by eogs engineering staff for the
properties reviewed by dm when compared in total on a net
equivalentcubicfeetofgas basis do not differ materially from
the estimates prepared by dm  such estimates by dm in the
aggregate varied by not more than 5 from those prepared by the
engineering staff of eog  all reports by dm were developed
utilizing geological and engineering data provided by eog

     no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event
subsequent to december 31 2004 is believed to have caused a
material change in the estimates of proved or proved developed
reserves as of that date

     standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating
to proved oil and gas reserves  the following information has been
developed utilizing procedures prescribed by sfas no 69 and based on
crude oil and natural gas reserve and production volumes estimated by
the engineering staff of eog  it may be useful for certain comparison
purposes but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating eog or
its performance  further information contained in the following
table should not be considered as representative of realistic
assessments of future cash flows nor should the standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows be viewed as representative of the
current value of eog

     the future cash flows presented below are based on sales prices
cost rates and statutory income tax rates in existence as of the date
of the projections  it is expected that material revisions to some
estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves may occur in the
future development and production of the reserves may occur in
periods other than those assumed and actual prices realized and costs
incurred may vary significantly from those used

     management does not rely upon the following information in making
investment and operating decisions  such decisions are based upon a
wide range of factors including estimates of probable as well as
proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered
more representative of a range of possible economic conditions that
may be anticipated

     the following table sets forth the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows from projected production of eogs
crude oil and natural gas reserves for the years ended december 31

item 1  business

general

     eog resources inc eog a delaware corporation organized
in 1985 together with its subsidiaries explores for develops
produces and markets natural gas and crude oil primarily in major
producing basins in the united states of america as well as in
canada and trinidad and to a lesser extent selected other
international areas including the united kingdom north sea
eogs principal producing areas are further described under
exploration and production below  eogs website address is
httpwwweogresourcescom  eogs annual report on form 10k
quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and
all amendments to those reports are made available free of
charge through its website as soon as reasonably practicable
after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the
securities and exchange commission sec

     at december 31 2003 eogs total estimated net proved
reserves were 5216 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe of
which estimated net proved natural gas reserves were 4645
billion cubic feet bcf and estimated net proved crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids reserves were 95 million
barrels mmbbl see supplemental information to consolidated
financial statements beginning on page 42 of eogs current
report on form 8k filed with the sec on february 24 2004
which included financial statements of eog for the fiscal year
ended december 31 2003 and is attached hereto as exhibit 991
form 8k filed on february 24 2004 at such date
approximately 49 of eogs reserves on a natural gas equivalent
basis were located in the united states 27 in trinidad 23
in canada and 1 in the united kingdom north sea  as of december
31 2003 eog employed approximately 1100 persons including
foreign national employees

     eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on
investment of capital by controlling all operating and capital
costs  this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of
cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost
effective basis  eog focuses its drilling activity toward
natural gas deliverability in addition to natural gas reserve
replacement and to a lesser extent crude oil exploitation and
exploration  eog focuses on the costeffective utilization of
advances in technology associated with the gathering processing
and interpretation of threedimensional seismic data the
development of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor
improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives and formation
logging techniques and reservoir fracturing methods these
advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to
reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas
reserve exploration exploitation and development  eog
implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally
generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost
reserves  eog also makes select tactical acquisitions that
result in additional economies of scale or land positions with
significant additional prospects  maintaining the lowest
possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent
and safe operations is also an important goal in the
implementation of eogs strategy

     with respect to information on eogs working interest in
wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are
determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by
eogs working interest in the wells or acreage

business segments

     eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil
exploration and production related

exploration and production

  north american operations

     eogs north american operations are focused on most of the
productive basins in the united states and canada utilizing
personnel who have developed experience and expertise unique to
the geology of that region thereby leveraging eogs knowledge
and cost structure into enhanced returns on invested capital

     at december 31 2003 87 of eogs net proved north american
reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis were natural gas and
13 were crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  a
substantial portion of eogs north american natural gas reserves
are in longlived fields with wellestablished production
histories eog believes that opportunities exist to increase
production in and around many of these fields through continued
development and application of new technology  eog will also
continue an active exploration program designed to extend fields
and add new trends to its broad portfolio of north american
plays  the following is a summary of significant developments
during 2003 and certain 2004 plans for eogs north american
operations

     united states  during 2003 eog continued its successful
permian basin horizontal drilling programs in the devonian play
of west texas and the bone spring play of southeast new mexico
improved horizontal technology continues to lower drilling and
completion costs along with increasing the production rates and
reserves of new wells  in 2003 eog initiated horizontal
drilling operations in the barnett shale play of the fort worth
basin  eog drilled approximately 58 net wells in the permian
and fort worth basins during 2003 and increased net average daily
production to approximately 100 million cubic feet per day mmcfd
of natural gas and 78 thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids  this represents a 7
increase in natural gas and a 21 increase in liquids production
from 2002 levels  eog plans an active year of drilling and
continued production growth in 2004

     eog increased drilling activity in the rocky mountains area
during 2003 drilling approximately 77 net wells  the majority
of the activity continues to be located in its key producing
areas of big piney wyoming  labarge platform and vernal utah 
uintahchapitanatural buttes and a new area in richland county
montana  eog is developing a new bakken horizontal play in
richland county montana and expects to drill approximately 13
net wells in 2004  during 2003 the net average daily production
for the rocky mountains area was approximately 117 mmcfd of
natural gas and 55 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural
gas liquids  eog expects to increase drilling in the uintah
basin in both the deep mesaverde and wasatch and in the
williston basin bakken horizontal oil play

     the midcontinent net average daily production during 2003 was
approximately 79 mmcfd of natural gas and 15 mbbld of crude oil
and condensate  natural gas production for 2003 increased 12
over 2002  in 2003 eog drilled 133 net wells in two core
areas  the hugotondeep play in the oklahoma panhandle and the
cleveland horizontal play in the texas panhandle  the hugoton
deep program will continue at a level comparable to 2003 while
an increase in the cleveland horizontal play program is expected
eog has expanded its cleveland position over the last year to
more than 64000 net acres and expects to drill over 50 cleveland
horizontal wells in 2004  the average cleveland gross well has
an initial rate of 15 mmcfd and an estimated ultimate recovery
of 125 bcfe  in addition to these two core areas eog will
remain active in the exploration of other plays throughout
oklahoma kansas and the texas panhandle

    the upper gulf coast continues to be a significant producing
and exploration area for eog  new operating areas were added in
east texas and north louisiana through exploration and property
trades during 2003 eog drilled approximately 68 net wells in the
upper gulf coast area during 2003  net average production for
the year was 96 mmcfd of natural gas and 31 mbbld of crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids  in 2004 eog will continue
to develop growth opportunities in east texas north louisiana
and mississippi and will test several high potential prospects
in the lower gulf coast areas of texas and south louisiana

    eog had another active year in south texas during 2003
drilling or participating in approximately 74 net wells  the
area averaged net production of approximately 169 mmcfd of
natural gas a 5 increase over 2002 and 22 mbbld of crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids  several second half 2003
discoveries in lavaca and san patricio counties resulted in
additional natural gas and liquids production of approximately
30 mmcfd and 35 mbbld net respectively  there was also
continued success and growth in the roleta and lobo trends with
key discoveries in webb and zapata counties eog had successful
drilling programs in the wilcox in duval and lavaca counties
the frio in nueces san patricio and matagorda counties and the
olmos in webb county  eog was successful in adding to its current
leasehold position in 2003 and this will provide additional
opportunities for its roleta lobo frio wilcox and olmos
programs in 2004

     in 2003 eog drilled over 200 net shallow devonian natural
gas wells in the appalachian basins  net production increased
throughout the year from 20 mmcfd in january to over 25 mmcfd of
natural gas in december averaging approximately 22 mmcfd for
the year  while shallow drilling will continue to play an
important role in these areas in 2004 eog will continue to
pursue higher impact plays such as the oriskany and trenton black
river

     in the gulf of mexico eog focuses on offshore texas and
louisiana  three fields south timbalier 156 eugene island 135
and matagorda island 623 account for over sixty percent of eogs
gulf of mexico net production  during 2003 total net production
averaged approximately 55 mmcfd of natural gas and 13 mbbld of
crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  in 2003 eog
drilled or participated in seven gross wells including a
significant exploration discovery at matagorda island 685  eog
operates and has a 60 working interest in this estimated 27 bcfe
discovery which is expected to commence sales in the second
quarter of 2004  the south timbalier 156 field a 2002
discovery commenced first sales in october 2003 with initial
gross production of 13 mmcfd of natural gas and 44 mbbld of
condensate  in 2004 eog plans a similar level of drilling
concentrated primarily on the gulf of mexico shelf with limited
deepwater activity possible

     at december 31 2003 eog held approximately 2424900 net
undeveloped acres in the united states

     canada  eog conducts operations through its canadian
subsidiary eog resources canada inc eogrc from offices in
calgary alberta  during 2003 eogrc was again successful with
its shallow natural gas strategy in western canada drilling a
record 1034 net wells and increasing its reserve base and
production potential  strategic property acquisitions were also
utilized to expand the shallow gas platform area in southeast
alberta  on october 1 2003 eogrc closed the largest asset
purchase of primarily natural gas properties in eogs history for
approximately us 320 million  these properties are essentially
adjacent to existing eogrc operations or are properties in which
eogrc already has a working interest  in late december 2003 eogrc
closed another property acquisition for us 46 million  eogrcs
net production during 2003 averaged approximately 165 mmcfd of
natural gas as compared to 154 mmcfd during 2002  crude oil
condensate and natural gas liquids averaged approximately 30
mbbld net in 2003  additions from strategic property
acquisitions and new wells coming on stream late in the year
increased fourth quarter 2003 net production to 196 mmcfd of
natural gas and 34 mbbld of crude oil condensate and natural
gas liquids key producing areas in the western canadian
sedimentary basin were the southeast albertasouthwest
saskatchewan shallow natural gas trend and grande prairie

kingdom north sea and is evaluating additional exploration
exploitation and development opportunities in the united kingdom
and other international areas

     trinidad  in november 1992 eog through its subsidiary
eog resources trinidad limited eogrt was awarded a 95 working
interest concession in the south east coast consortium secc
block offshore trinidad encompassing three undeveloped fields 
the kiskadee ibis and oilbird fields  the kiskadee and ibis
fields have since been developed and are being produced  the
oilbird field was successfully appraised by the drilling of two
wells in the fourth quarter of 2001 and one well in the fourth
quarter of 2003  the oilbird 2 well encountered 380 feet of net
pay and the oilbird 3 well encountered 290 feet of net pay  the
oilbird 3x well which was drilled during 2003 encountered 64
feet of net pay in the targeted sand  eogrt expects to develop
the oilbird field over the next few years and place it on
production in early 2007  eogrt discovered a new field with the
drilling of the parula 1 wildcat well in 2002 which encountered
370 feet of net pay  this field was brought on stream in
february 2004  the term of the license covering the secc block
expires in december 2029

     in july 1996 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidadua block limited eogua signed a production sharing
contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the
modified ua block where eog holds a 100 working interest eog
drilled its first commitment well oa1 on this block in 1998
this well encountered over 500 feet of net pay in the first
quarter of 2001 eog drilled the oa2 well which encountered 305
feet of net pay and increased gross proved reserves to a field
total of 870 bcfe  in september 2001 eogua set a platform and
jacket and first production began in the second quarter of 2002

       existing surplus processing and transportation capacity at the
pelican field facilities owned and operated by a subsidiary of
eogrts partners in the secc block is being used to process and
transport much of eogrts natural gas production and all of its
condensate and crude oil production from the secc and ua blocks


     in april 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidad lrl unlimited signed a production sharing contract with
the government of trinidad and tobago for the lower reverse l
block which is adjacent to the secc block  eog holds a 100
working interest in the lower reverse l block  in the fourth
quarter of 2003 eog drilled the first exploration well on this
block  the well was determined to be uneconomical

     in october 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidadub block unlimited signed a production sharing
contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the
modified ub block which is also adjacent to the secc block
eog holds a 55 working interest in and operates the modified
ub block  primera oil  gas ltd a trinidadian company holds
the remaining 45 interest

     at december 31 2003 eog held approximately 194500 net
undeveloped acres in trinidad

     natural gas from eogs trinidad operations is being sold to
the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc under the
following arrangements

      under the first takeorpay contract which expires in 2009
       natural gas is delivered to ngc for resale to trinidad local
       markets  during 2003 eog delivered net average production of
       104 mmcfd of natural gas under this agreement

      under the second takeorpay contract which expires in
       2017 eog delivers to ngc approximately 60 mmcfd gross
       of natural gas which is resold to an anhydrous ammonia
       plant owned by caribbean nitrogen company limited cncl
       based on average 2003 prices approximately 48 mmcfd of
       natural gas delivered to ngc was net to eog in 2003
       eogrt owns an approximate 12 equity interest in cncl a
       trinidadian company which has constructed an ammonia plant in

       in cncl was approximately 14 million cncl commenced production
       in june 2002 and currently produces approximately 1950 metric
       tons of ammonia daily  at december 31 2003 cncl had a long
       term debt balance of approximately 218 million which is non
       recourse to cncls shareholders  as part of the financing for
       cncl the shareholders agreed to enter into a postcompletion
       deficiency loan agreement with cncl to fund the costs of
       operations payment of principal and interest to the principal
       creditor and other cash deficiencies of cncl up to 30 million
       up to 4 million of which is to be provided by eogrt  the
       shareholders agreement requires the consent of the holders of
       90 or more of the shares to take certain material actions
       accordingly given its current level of equity ownership eogrt
       is able to exercise significant influence over the operating and
       financial policies of cncl and therefore eog accounts for the
       investment using the equity method  during 2003 eog recognized
       equity income of 37 million from cncl

      under a fifteenyear takeorpay contract eog is to supply
       approximately 60 mmcfd gross of natural gas to ngc  this gas
       will be resold by ngc to an anhydrous ammonia plant that is
       currently under construction and is owned by nitrogen 2000
       unlimited n2000  eogs subsidiary eog resources nitro2000
       ltd eognitro2000 owns an approximate 23 equity interest

       eognitro2000s equity interest and investment in n2000 was
       approximately 27 and 20 million respectively  in february
       2004 a portion of eognitro2000s shareholdings was sold to one
       of the other shareholders  the sale did not result in any gain
       or loss  n2000 is constructing an ammonia plant in trinidad at
       an expected total cost of approximately 320 million and is expected
       to commence production in the third quarter 2004  at december
       31 2003 n2000 had a longterm debt balance of approximately
       172 million which is nonrecourse to n2000s shareholders  as

       ownership eognitro2000 is able to exercise significant influence
       over the operating and financial policies of n2000 and therefore
       eog accounts for the investment using the equity method

      lastly under a fifteenyear requirements natural gas contract
       which was also recently signed eog will ultimately supply 87
       mmcfd net of natural gas to a methanol plant based on current
       price and operating assumptions  the plant is presently under
       construction and is expected to start up in mid2005 with eog
       supplying 67 mmcfd net for the first four years of the contract
       eog has no equity investment in this plant

     united kingdom  in 2003 eogs subsidiary eog resources
united kingdom limited eoguk participated with other north sea
partners in the drilling of three exploration wells two of which
were commercial successes  in 2002 eoguk acquired a 25 non
operating working interest in a portion of block 4916 located
in the southern gas basin of the north sea  the first commercial
well the 491614z was drilled in the southern gas basin
and temporarily abandoned in february 2003  it encountered
approximately 106 bcf gross of natural gas reserves in the
rotliegendes formation 26 bcf net to eoguk  eoguk and its
partners are as of this date drilling a development well 4916
vb from the vampire platform  in 2003 eoguk acquired a 30 non
operating working interest in a portion of blocks 531 and 532
these blocks are also located in the southern gas basin of the north
sea  eoguk drilled and completed as a natural gas producer well

     other international  eog continues to evaluate other select
natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside north america
primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries
where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been
identified

marketing

     wellhead marketing  eogs north america wellhead natural
gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and
under longterm natural gas contracts at marketresponsive
prices  in many instances the longterm contract prices closely
approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the
spot market  wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad are sold
under either a contract with a fixed price schedule with annual
escalations or a contract that is price dependent on caribbean
ammonia index prices

     substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate
is sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive
prices

     during 2003 sales to subsidiaries of a major utility
company and subsidiaries of a major integrated oil and gas
company accounted for 12 and 10 respectively of eogs oil and
gas revenues  no other individual purchaser accounted for 10 or
more of eogs oil and gas revenues for the same period eog does
not believe that the loss of any single purchaser will have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of eog

competition

     eog competes for reserve acquisitions and explorationexploitation
leases licenses and concessions frequently against companies with
substantially larger financial and other resources  to the extent eogs
exploration budget is lower than that of certain of its competitors
eog may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves
leases licenses and concessions  competitive factors include
price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline
connection times and distribution efficiencies  in addition eog
faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as
liquefied natural gas imported into the united states from other
countries

regulation

     united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil
production  natural gas and crude oil production operations are
subject to various types of regulation including regulation in
the united states by state and federal agencies

     united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry
is under constant review for amendment or expansion  also
numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are
authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and
regulations which among other things require permits for the
drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the
waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through
proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and
regulate environmental and safety matters  the regulatory burden
on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business
and consequently affects its profitability

     a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in the big
piney area and in the gulf of mexico as well as some in other
areas are granted by the federal government and administered by
the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management
service mms both federal agencies  operations conducted by
eog on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous
statutory and regulatory restrictions concerning the above and
other matters  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to
appropriate permits issued by the blm and the mms

     blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms
requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case
of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental
shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such
offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory
requirements including the need for prior mms approval for
exploration development and production plans stringent
engineering and construction specifications applicable to
offshore production facilities regulations restricting the
flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the
plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all
production facilities  under certain circumstances the mms may
require operations on federal leases to be suspended or
terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely
affect eogs interests

     the mms amended the regulations governing the calculation of
royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal
leases effective june 1 2000  the new rules modified the
valuation procedures for both armslength and nonarmslength
crude oil transactions  for nonarms length transactions the
revised rules replace a familiar set of benchmarks eg posted
prices comparable sales with an indexing system based on spot
prices at nearby market centers  in addition the revised rules
limit deductions on postproduction transportation costs and
disallow altogether deductions for postproduction marketing costs
together these changes are expected to somewhat increase eogs
royalty obligation  two industry trade association have sought
judicial review of the revised regulations but the mms has
already proposed additional changes to the regulations some of
which are beneficial to the industry  eog cannot predict what
effect the outcome of the pending litigation or the pending
rulemaking will be or what net effect if any it will have on
eogs operations  the revised regulations are expected to be
promulgated in april 2004 and effective in june 2004

     in march 2000 a federal district court vacated mms
regulations which sought to clarify the types of costs that are
deductible transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation
of production sold off the lease  in particular mms disallowed
deduction of costs associated with marketer fees cash out and
other pipeline imbalance penalties or longterm storage fees
however on appeal by the government a federal court of appeals
in 2002 reversed a 2000 district court decision reinstating mmss
categorical disallowance of deductions for postproduction marketing
costs except for firm demand charges  while this litigation was
directed at a gas transportation rule the disallowance of marketing
costs applies to crude oil as well  as in the still pending oil
valuation litigation two trade associations brought the legal
challenge of the gas transportation rules the trade associations
petition seeking supreme court review of the court of appeals
decision was denied

     sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by
eog are made at unregulated market prices

     the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act
of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa
these statutes are administered by the federal energy regulatory
commission ferc  effective january 1 1993 the natural gas
wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for
all first sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog
of its own production  all other sales of natural gas by eog
such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties remain
jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under
the nga which has flexible terms and conditions  consequently
all of eogs sales of natural gas currently may be made at market
prices subject to applicable contract provisions  eogs
jurisdictional sales however are subject to the future
possibility of greater federal oversight including the
possibility that the ferc might prospectively impose more
restrictive conditions on such sales

     since 1985 the ferc has endeavored to enhance competition
in natural gas markets by making natural gas transportation more
accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and
nondiscriminatory basis  these efforts culminated in order no
636 and various rehearing orders order no 636 which mandated
a fundamental restructuring of interstate natural gas pipeline
sales and transportation services including the unbundling by
interstate natural gas pipelines of the sales transportation
storage and other components of their service and to separately
state the rates for each unbundled service  order no 636 does
not directly regulate eogs activities but has an indirect
effect because of its broad scope  order no 636 has ended
interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural
gas and substantially increased competition in natural gas
markets  in spite of this uncertainty order no 636 may enhance
eogs ability to market and transport its natural gas production
although it may also subject eog to more restrictive pipeline
imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation of such
tolerances  order no 636 led directly to the mms gas transportation
regulations addressed above which limit deductions for post
production marketing costs and result in a somewhat expanded
royalty obligation

     eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas
pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc
has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not
subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga  state regulation of
gathering facilities generally includes various safety
environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take
requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at
both the state and federal levels as a result of pipeline
restructuring under order no 636  for example the texas
railroad commission has approved changes to its regulations
governing transportation and gathering services performed by
intrastate pipelines and gatherers which prohibit such entities
from unduly discriminating in favor of their affiliates  eogs
gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be
subject in the future to the application of state or federal
regulation of rates and services

     eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become
subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the
design installation testing construction operation
replacement and management of facilities  additional rules and
legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted
from time to time  eog cannot predict what effect if any such
legislation might have on its operations but the industry could
be required to incur additional capital expenditures and
increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory
changes

     the ferc conducted a broad review of its transportation
regulations including how they operate in conjunction with state
proposals for retail natural gas marketing restructuring whether
to eliminate costofservice rates for shortterm transportation
whether to allocate all shortterm capacity on the basis of
competitive auctions and whether changes to its longterm
transportation policies may also be appropriate to alleviate a
market bias toward shortterm contracts  this review culminated
in part with the fercs issuance of order no 637 on february 9
2000

     order no 637 revises the fercs current regulatory
framework for purposes of improving the efficiency of the market
and providing captive pipeline customers with the opportunity to
reduce their cost of holding longterm pipeline capacity while
continuing to protect against the exercise of market power
order no 637 revises ferc pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for shortterm released capacity for a twoyear period
and permitting pipelines to file for peakoffpeak and term
differentiated rate structures  order no 637 does not however
require the allocation of all shortterm capacity on the basis of
competitive auctions  as had been proposed by the ferc  order
no 637 adopts changes in regulations relating to scheduling
procedures capacity segmentation and pipeline penalties to
improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate
pipeline grid  it also narrows pipeline customers right of
first refusal to remove economic biases in the current rule
while still protecting captive customers ability to resubscribe
to longterm capacity  finally it improves the fercs reporting
requirements to provide more transparent pricing information and
permit more effective monitoring of the market  appeals of order
no 637 are pending court review  eog cannot predict what the
outcome of that review will be or what effect it will have on
eogs operations

     while order no 637 and any subsequent ferc action will
affect eog only indirectly the order and related inquiries are
intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets
while maintaining adequate consumer protections

     eog cannot predict the effect that any of the aforementioned
orders or the challenges to such orders will ultimately have on
eogs operations  additional proposals and proceedings that
might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to
time by congress the ferc and the courts eog cannot predict
when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become
effective  it should also be noted that the natural gas industry
historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is
no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being
pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely

     environmental regulation  united states  various federal
state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of
materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment affect eogs operations and costs
as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil
exploration development and production operations and could
cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs
in connection with a release of regulated substances including
crude oil into the environment  in addition eog has acquired
certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions
with respect to the management and disposal or release of
hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control  under
environmental laws and regulations eog could be required to
remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior
owners or operators  in addition eog could be responsible under
environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in
which eog owns an interest but is not the operator  compliance
with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall cost of
business but has not had a material adverse effect on eogs
operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based
on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the
near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to
its total exploration and development expenditure program in
order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but
inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed eog
is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance  eog also
could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it
sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent
equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or
other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such
sites  in this regard eog has been named as a potentially
responsible party in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act and may be named as a potentially responsible party
in other similar proceedings in the future  it is not
anticipated that the costs incurred by eog in connection with the
presently pending proceedings will individually or in the
aggregate have a materially adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of eog

     canadian regulation  the crude oil and natural gas industry
in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations
imposed by various levels of government  it is not expected that
any of these controls or regulations will affect eog operations
in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil
and gas companies of similar size eog is unable to predict what
additional legislation or amendments may be enacted

     in addition each province has regulations that govern land
tenure royalties production rates and other matters  the
royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of
crude oil and natural gas production  royalties payable on
production from private lands are determined by negotiations
between the mineral owner and the lessee although production
from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and
royalties  crown royalties are determined by government
regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the
value of the gross production and the rate of royalties payable
generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices well
productivity geographical location field discovery date and the
type or quality of the petroleum product produced

     environmental matters  canada  in canada the crude oil
and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental
regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation that
provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or
emissions of various substances produced or utilized with oil and
gas industry operations  in addition wells and facility sites
must be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial
authorities  compliance with such legislation can require
significant expenditures  a breach of such legislation may
result in the imposition of fines and penalties the revocation
of licenses and authorizations or civil liability for pollution
damage

     other international regulation  eogs exploration and
production operations outside north america are subject to
various types of regulations imposed by the respective
governments of the countries in which eogs operations are
conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that
country  eog currently has operations in offshore trinidad and
the united kingdom north sea

enron corp bankruptcy

     in december 2001 enron corp and certain of its affiliates
including enron north america corp filed voluntary petitions
for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states
bankruptcy code  eog recorded 192 million in charges
associated with the enron bankruptcies in the fourth quarter of
2001 related to certain contracts with enron affiliates
including 2001 and 2002 natural gas and crude oil derivative
contracts  based on eogs review of all matters related to enron
corp and its affiliates eog believes that enron corps chapter
11 proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on eogs
financial position

other matters

     energy prices  since eog is primarily a natural gas
company it is more significantly impacted by changes in natural
gas prices than in the prices for crude oil condensate or
natural gas liquids  average north america wellhead natural gas
prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the
last three years  these fluctuations resulted in a 9 increase
in the average wellhead natural gas price for north america
received by eog from 2000 to 2001 a decrease of 32 from 2001 to
2002 and an increase of 75 from 2002 to 2003  wellhead natural
gas volumes from trinidad are sold under either a contract with a
fixed price schedule with annual escalations or a contract that
is price dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices
substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate is
sold under various terms and arrangements at market responsive
prices crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated
during the last three years  due to the many uncertainties
associated with the world political environment the
availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the
relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources
in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes
may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate and ammonia
prices in the future

     risk management  eog engages in price risk management
activities from time to time  these activities are intended to
manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for
natural gas and crude oil  eog utilizes derivative financial
instruments primarily price swaps and collars as the means to
manage this price risk  in addition to these financial
transactions eog is a party to various physical commodity
contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods
of time and have varying pricing provisions  under sfas no 133
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
as amended by sfas nos 137 138 and 149 these various physical
commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal
sales exception and therefore are not subject to hedge
accounting or marktomarket accounting  the financial impact of
these various physical commodity contracts is included in
revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects average
realized hydrocarbon prices

     presented below is a summary of eogs natural gas financial
collar contracts and natural gas and crude oil financial price
swap contracts as of march 11 2004 with prices expressed in
dollars per million british thermal units mmbtu and in
dollars per barrel bbl as applicable and notional volumes
in million british thermal units per day mmbtud and in barrels
per day bbld as applicable  as indicated eog does not have
any financial collar or swap contracts that cover periods beyond
october 2004  moreover eog has not entered into any additional
natural gas financial collar contracts or natural gas or crude
oil financial price swap contracts since december 31 2003  eog
accounts for these collar and swap contracts using marktomarket

     severance tax exemption  natural gas production from wells
spudded or completed after may 24 1989 and before september 1
1996 in tight formations in texas qualified for a tenyear
exemption from severance taxes subject to certain limitations
this tenyear exemption began september 1 1991 and ended august
31 2001  natural gas production from qualifying wells spudded
or completed after august 31 1996 is entitled to use a reduced

item 2  properties

oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves

     reserve information  for estimates of eogs net proved and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including
crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental
information to consolidated financial statements in the form 8k
filed on february 24 2004 and attached hereto as exhibit 991

     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures including many
factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set
forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial
statements represent only estimates  reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount
and quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment  as a result estimates of different
engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate upward or downward
accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the
quantities ultimately recovered  the meaningfulness of such
estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the
assumptions upon which they were based

     in general the volume of production from eogs oil and gas
properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the
extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved
reserves or conducts successful exploration exploitation and
development activities the proved reserves of eog will decline
as reserves are produced  volumes generated from future
activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level
of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the
costs incurred in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed
with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth
in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

item 1  business

general

     eog resources inc a delaware corporation organized in
1985 eog together with its subsidiaries explores for
develops produces and markets natural gas and crude oil
primarily in major producing basins in the united states as well
as in canada and trinidad and to a lesser extent selected other
international areas eogs principal producing areas are further
described under exploration and production below  eogs
website address is httpwwweogresourcescom  eogs annual
report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current
reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are made
available free of charge through its website as soon as
reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or
furnished to the securities and exchange commission

     at december 31 2002 eogs estimated net proved natural gas
reserves were 4091 billion cubic feet bcf and estimated net
proved crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids reserves
were 85 million barrels mmbbl see supplemental information
to consolidated financial statements on page 37 of eogs current
report on form 8k filed with the securities and exchange
commission on february 20 2003 which included financial
statements of eog for the fiscal year ended december 31 2002
the form 8k filed on february 20 2003  at such date
approximately 49 of eogs reserves on a natural gas equivalent
basis was located in the united states 19 in canada and 32
in trinidad  as of december 31 2002 eog employed approximately
1000 persons including foreign national employees

     eogs business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on
investment of capital by controlling all operating and capital
costs  this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of
cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost
effective basis  eog focuses its drilling activity toward
natural gas deliverability in addition to natural gas reserve
replacement and to a lesser extent crude oil exploitation and
exploration  eog focuses on the costeffective utilization of
advances in technology associated with the gathering processing
and interpretation of threedimensional seismic data the
development of reservoir simulation models the use of new andor
improved drill bits mud motors and mud additives and formation
logging techniques and reservoir fracturing methods these
advanced technologies are used as appropriate throughout eog to
reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas
reserve exploration exploitation and development  eog
implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally
generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost
reserves  eog also makes selected tactical acquisitions that
result in additional economies of scale or land positions with
significant additional prospects  achieving and maintaining the
lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with
prudent and safe operations are also important goals in the
implementation of eogs strategy

     with respect to information on eogs working interest in
wells or acreage net oil and gas wells or acreage are
determined by multiplying gross oil and gas wells or acreage by
eogs working interest in the wells or acreage  unless otherwise
defined all references to wells are gross

business segments

     eogs operations are all natural gas and crude oil
exploration and production related

exploration and production

  north american operations

     eogs north american operations are organized into eight
operating divisions each focusing on several basins utilizing
personnel who have developed experience and expertise unique to
the geology of the region thereby leveraging eogs knowledge and
cost structure into enhanced returns on invested capital

     at december 31 2002 84 of eogs proved united states
reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis was natural gas and
16 was crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  a
substantial portion of eogs united states natural gas reserves
are in longlived fields with wellestablished production
histories eog believes that opportunities exist to increase
production in many of these fields through continued development
and application of new technology  eog will also continue an
active exploration program designed to extend existing fields
and add new trends to our broad portfolio of north american
plays  the following is a summary of significant developments
during 2002 and certain drilling plans for 2003 for eogs north
american operating divisions

     midland texas division  the division operations are
primarily focused in the delaware val verde and midland basin
areas of west texas and southeast new mexico  during 2002 the
division continued to focus on improving drilling and exploration
techniques in the devonian horizontal trend with the successful
implementation of dual lateral completion technology which has
lowered finding costs and improved rates of return for the play
the division also introduced waterfracturing technology to the
devonian play with encouraging results  during 2002 the
division drilled 65 wells and net average daily production was 94
million cubic feet mmcf per day of natural gas and 65
thousand barrels mbbl per day of crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids the midland division plans an aggressive
drilling program focused in the devonian and permopenn carbonate
trends of west texas the atokamorrow trends in southeast new
mexico and in the barnett shale trend of the ft worth basin
the division will also continue to develop secondary recovery
projects to increase production from existing fields  eog has
developed a wide range of new growth opportunities in the permian
basin to ensure continued growth

     denver colorado division  key producing and exploration
areas continue to be in the traditional core areas of big piney 
labarge platform vernal  uintah basin  chapita  natural
buttes and southwest wyoming  washakie basin  during 2002 the
division continued development of these core areas and further
expanded the 2001 uintah basin exploration successes drilling
seven delineation wells  the division drilled or participated in
76 development wells and eight wildcats during 2002  the
activity level of 2002 was moderated from 2001 primarily due to
fiscal restraint brought on by lower natural gas prices
throughout the rockies  net production for the division in 2002
averaged 121 mmcf per day of natural gas and 66 mbbl per day of
crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids  eog expects that
drilling will increase in big piney wyoming and vernal utah
during 2003

     oklahoma citymidcontinent division the midcontinent
division had average net production during 2002 of approximately
71 mmcf per day of natural gas and 21 mbbl of crude oil and
condensate  in the fourth quarter 2002 net average production
of natural gas increased 19 to 81 mmcf per day in 2002 from 68
mmcf per day in 2001 in addition to an increase of crude oil and
condensate production to 19 mbbl in the fourth quarter 2002
compared to 11 mbbl in the same period for 2001  the divisions
production activities span 48 counties in four states with the
volume increase resulting largely from the continued success in
the hugotondeep trend drilling in texas county oklahoma the
2002 division drilling program included 128 wells in three states
which resulted in 189 reserve replacement  most notable for
2002 were seven wells drilled in the hugotondeep marmaton play
that produced 3 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe in the
last six months of 2002  in addition the divisions texas
county war party waterflood produced 670 mbbl of crude oil from
the cherokee formation and the project paid out in less than ten
months  the division had numerous stratigraphic discoveries in
other plays throughout the basin and expects to drill a slightly
expanded program in 2003

    tyler texas division  key areas of production for the
division are the sabine uplift region upper texas coast and
mississippi salt basin  during 2002 the division drilled or
participated in 55 wells  net production for the division
averaged approximately 106 mmcf per day of natural gas and 39
mbbl per day of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids in
2002   the division had continued success in the mississippi
salt basin drilling for the shallow eutaw and selma chalk and
the deep hosston and sligo formations  eog expects drilling in
these areas to continue through 2003 and expects to have an
active program in the east texas sabine uplift region

     corpus christi texas division  the corpus christi division
had an active 2002 drilling 56 wells  during 2002 net
production for the division averaged 160 mmcf per day of natural
gas an increase of approximately 7 over 2001  the division had
reserve replacement through drilling of 135 and for the fifth
year in a row the reserves per well drilled have increased the
principal areas of activity are in the frio trend in matagorda
nueces and san patricio counties the wilcox trend in duval
county and the loboroleta trend in webb and zapata counties
eog expects that drilling will continue to be strong through 2003
in nueces san patricio duval webb and zapata counties

      pittsburgh  pennsylvania division  in 2002 the  division
drilled 200 shallow wells  net average production increased from
13  mmcf  per day of natural gas in 2001 to 20 mmcf  per  day  of
natural  gas in 2002  the division expanded its acreage position
by  over  60000  net  acres in key exploratory  and  development
plays and plans to drill in excess of 200 wells in 2003   while
most  of  the  division drilling will concentrate on  development
wells  several  higher  impact  exploratory  and  unconventional
reservoir wells will be drilled in 2003

     houston texasoffshore division  the offshore division
focuses on the gulf of mexico in texas and louisiana  two
fields eugene island 135 and matagorda island 623 account for
over half of the divisions production  during 2002 total net
production averaged approximately 63 mmcf per day of natural gas
throughout 2002 the division drilled or participated in eight
wells including a significant exploration discovery at south
timbalier 156  eog operates and has a 50 working interest in
this estimated 50 bcfe discovery which is expected to commence
sales in the third quarter of 2003  another discovery on high
island 206 came on line in february 2003  two successful
development wells were drilled on the matagorda island 623 block
deep water activity included the assignment with regulatory
permitting contingencies of one half the working interest held
in the tuscany prospect acquired in the 2001 eastern gulf lease
sale to an industry partner in consideration for their agreement
to bear 100 of eogs cost for drilling the initial exploratory
well expected to be drilled in 2003  eog retains a 375 working
interest in the prospect

     calgary canada division  the division conducts operations
through eogs canadian subsidiary eog resources canada inc
from offices in calgary alberta  during 2002 the division was
again successful with its strategy of drilling a large number of
shallow gas wells in western canada which contributed to a
record 1089 wells drilled in 2002 and increased its reserve
base and production potential  strategic property and small
corporate acquisitions were also utilized to expand the shallow
gas platform area in southwest saskatchewan and southeast
alberta  division net production during 2002 averaged
approximately 154 mmcf per day of natural gas as compared to 126
mmcf per day of natural gas during 2001  new wells coming on
stream late in the year increased december 2002 net average
deliverability to 185 mmcfe per day key producing areas in the
western canadian sedimentary basin were sandhills blackfoot se
alberta shallow and grande prairie  wapiti

  outside north america operations

     eog has producing operations offshore trinidad and is
evaluating exploration exploitation and development
opportunities in selected other international areas  the
trinidad operations are conducted through its trinidadian
subsidiary eog resources trinidad limited eogrt from
its port of spain trinidad office

     trinidad  in november 1992 eog through its
subsidiary eogrt was awarded a 95 working interest
concession in the south east coast consortium secc block
offshore trinidad encompassing three undeveloped fields 
the kiskadee ibis and oilbird fields previously held by
three governmentowned energy companies  the kiskadee and
ibis fields have since been developed  the oilbird field
was successfully appraised by the drilling of two wells in
the fourth quarter of 2001 and will be developed over the
next few years  the oilbird 2 well encountered 380 feet of
net pay and the oilbird 3 well encountered 290 feet of net
pay  a discovery was made with the parula 1 wildcat well
in 2002 which encountered 370 feet of net pay  this field
is scheduled to be developed and brought on stream during
2004  existing surplus processing and transportation
capacity at the pelican field facilities owned and operated
by trinidad and tobago governmentowned companies is being
used to process and transport existing production  natural
gas is being sold into the local market under a takeorpay
agreement with the national gas company of trinidad and
tobago  in 2002 deliveries net to eog averaged 135 mmcf
per day of natural gas and 24 mbbl per day of crude oil and
condensate  in august 2002 eog and its coowners were
granted a 25year extension of the secc block through
december 2029

     in july 1996 eog through its subsidiary eog resources
trinidadua block ltd signed a production sharing
contract with the government of trinidad and tobago for the
modified ua block where eog holds a 100 working interest
eog drilled its first commitment well oa1 on this block
in 1998  this well encountered over 500 feet of net pay in
the first quarter of 2001 eog drilled the oa2 well which
encountered 305 feet of net pay and increased gross proved
reserves to a field total of 870 bcfe  in september 2001
eog set a platform and jacket and first production began in
the third quarter of 2002  this field supplies
approximately 50 mmcf per day net to eog under a 15year
natural gas supply contract to a 1850 metric ton per day
anhydrous ammonia plant which is owned by caribbean nitrogen
company limited cncl a trinidadian company in which eog
has an approximate 16 equity interest the construction of the
plant was completed during the second quarter of 2002

     in april 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog
resources trinidad lrl unlimited signed a production
sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago
for the lower reverse l block which is adjacent to the
secc block  eog holds a 100 working interest in the lower
reverse l block

     in october 2002 eog through its subsidiary eog
resources trinidadub block unlimited signed a production
sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago
for the modified ub block which is also adjacent to the
secc block  eog holds a 55 working interest in and operates
the modified ub block and primera oil  gas ltd a trinidadian
company holds the remaining 45 interest

     eogrt owns an approximate 16 equity interest in a
trinidadian company named cncl which has constructed an
ammonia plant in pt lisas trinidad  the other
shareholders in cncl are ferrostaal ag and subsidiaries of
duke energy halliburton and cl financial ltd  at december
31 2002 investment in cncl was approximately 14 million
cncl commenced production in june 2002 and currently
produces approximately 1850 metric tons of ammonia daily
at december 31 2002 cncl had a longterm debt balance of
approximately 219 million which is nonrecourse to cncls
shareholders  as part of the financing for cncl the
shareholders agreed to enter into a postcompletion
deficiency loan agreement with cncl to fund the costs of
operation payment of principal and interest to the
principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of cncl up to
30 million up to approximately 5 million of which is to be
provided by eogrt  the shareholders agreement requires the
consent of the holders of 90 or more of the shares to take
certain material actions  accordingly given its current
level of equity ownership eogrt is able to exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of cncl and therefore it accounts for the
investment using the equity method  during 2002 eog
recognized equity income of 03 million

     secondly eog through its subsidiary eog resources
nitro2000 limited eognitro2000 owns an approximate 31
equity interest in a trinidadian company named nitrogen
2000 unlimited n2000  the other shareholders in n2000
are subsidiaries of ferrostaal ag halliburton and cl
financial ltd  at december 31 2002 eogs investment in
n2000 was approximately 18 million  n2000 is constructing
an ammonia plant in trinidad at an expected cost of
approximately 320 million and is expected to commence
production in 2005  at december 31 2002 n2000 had a long
term debt balance of approximately 7 million the repayment
of which has been guaranteed by ferrostaal ag  eog has
agreed to reimburse ferrostaal ag for approximately 400000
in the event that ferrostaal ag is required to pay the debt
balance  upon receipt of an amendment to n2000s
certificate of environmental clearance and confirmation from
the lender that it is satisfied with the amendment this
longterm debt will become nonrecourse to all of n2000s
shareholders  n2000 has received the amendment and is
awaiting confirmation from the lender that it is satisfied
with the amendment   as part of the loan agreement for the
n2000 financing affiliates of the shareholders have entered
into a precompletion deficiency loan agreement with n2000
to fund plant cost overruns up to 15 million up to
approximately 5 million of which is to be provided by the
immediate parent company of eognitro2000  affiliates of the
shareholders have also entered into a postcompletion deficiency
loan agreement with n2000 to fund the costs of operation
payment of principal and interest to the principal creditor
and other cash deficiencies of n2000 up to 30 million up to
approximately 9 million of which is to be provided by the immediate
parent company of eognitro2000  the shareholders agreement
requires the consent of the holders of 90 or more of the
shares to take certain material actions  accordingly given
its current level of equity ownership eog through
eognitro2000 is able to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of n2000 and therefore
it accounts for the investment using the equity method

     in november 2002 the eog subsidiaries along with the
ferrostaal ag affiliates entered into share purchase agreements
for the sale of a portion of their shareholdings in cncl and
n2000 with a third party energy company  eog expects the
eog subsidiaries to close these transactions during the
first quarter of 2003 once certain conditions precedent have
occurred  the sale will leave the eog subsidiaries with
more than a 10 equity interest in each of cncl and n2000
eog does not expect these transactions to result in any
gains or losses

     at december 31 2002 eog held approximately 194500
net undeveloped acres in trinidad

     other international  eog continues to evaluate other
selected conventional natural gas and crude oil
opportunities outside north america primarily by pursuing
exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous
natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified
including the united kingdom

     substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate
is sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive
prices

     during 2002 sales to three subsidiaries of a major utility
company accounted for 14 of eogs oil and gas revenues  no
other individual purchaser accounted for 10 or more of eogs oil
and gas revenues for the same period  eog does not believe that
the loss of any single purchaser will have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
eog

     other marketing  eog resources marketing inc eogm a
wholly owned subsidiary of eog is a marketing company engaging
in various marketing activities  eogm enters into natural gas
sales transactions with various purchasers under a variety of
terms and conditions and supplies these sales by purchasing
natural gas from various sources including thirdparty
producers marketing companies and eogs own production  in
addition eogm has purchased and constructed several small gas
gathering systems in order to facilitate its entry into the gas
gathering business on a limited basis

competition

     eog actively competes for reserve acquisitions and
explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions
frequently against companies with substantially larger financial
and other resources  to the extent eogs exploration budget is
lower than that of certain of its competitors eog may be
disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves
leases licenses and concessions  competitive factors include
price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline
connection times and distribution efficiencies  in addition eog
faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies such as
natural gas from canada

regulation

     united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil
production  natural gas and crude oil production operations are
subject to various types of regulation including regulation in
the united states by state and federal agencies

     united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry
is under constant review for amendment or expansion  also
numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are
authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and
regulations which among other things require permits for the
drilling of wells regulate the spacing of wells prevent the
waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through
proration and restrictions on flaring require drilling bonds and
regulate environmental and safety matters  the regulatory burden
on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business
and consequently affects its profitability

     a substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases in the big
piney area and in the gulf of mexico as well as some in other
areas are granted by the federal government and administered by
the bureau of land management the blm and the minerals
management service the mms both federal agencies
operations conducted by eog on federal oil and gas leases must
comply with numerous statutory and regulatory restrictions
concerning the above and other matters  certain operations must
be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the blm
and the mms

     blm and mms leases contain relatively standardized terms
requiring compliance with detailed regulations and in the case
of offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental
shelf lands act which are subject to change by the mms such
offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory
requirements including the need for prior mms approval for
exploration development and production plans stringent
engineering and construction specifications applicable to
offshore production facilities regulations restricting the
flaring or venting of production and regulations governing the
plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all
production facilities  under certain circumstances the mms may
require operations on federal leases to be suspended or
terminated any such suspension or termination could adversely
affect eogs interests

     the mms amended the regulations governing the calculation of
royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal
leases effective june 1 2000  the new rules modified the
valuation procedures for both armslength and nonarmslength
crude oil transactions to decrease reliance on oil posted prices
and assign a value to crude oil that in the opinion of mms
better reflects its market value  two industry trade
associations have sought judicial review of the new rules in
federal district court  eog cannot predict what effect the
outcome of the litigation will be or what effect if any it will
have on eogs operations

     in march 2000 a federal district court vacated mms
regulations which sought to clarify the types of costs that are
deductible transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation
of production sold off the lease  in particular mms disallowed
deduction of costs associated with marketer fees cash out and
other pipeline imbalance penalties or longterm storage fees
the united states has appealed the district court ruling  eog
cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or what
effect if any it will have on eogs operations

     sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by
eog are made at unregulated market prices

     the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas act
of 1938 the nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 the
ngpa these statutes are administered by the federal energy
regulatory commission the ferc  effective january 1 1993
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated
natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which
includes all sales by eog of its own production  all other sales
of natural gas by eog such as those of natural gas purchased
from third parties remain jurisdictional sales subject to a
blanket sales certificate under the nga which has flexible terms
and conditions  consequently all of eogs sales of natural gas
currently may be made at market prices subject to applicable
contract provisions  eogs jurisdictional sales however are
subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight
including the possibility that the ferc might prospectively
impose more restrictive conditions on such sales

     since 1985 the ferc has endeavored to enhance competition
in natural gas markets by making natural gas transportation more
accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and
nondiscriminatory basis  these efforts culminated in order no
636 and various rehearing orders order no 636 which
mandated a fundamental restructuring of interstate natural gas
pipeline sales and transportation services including the
unbundling by interstate natural gas pipelines of the sales
transportation storage and other components of their service
and to separately state the rates for each unbundled service
order no 636 does not directly regulate eogs activities but
has an indirect effect because of its broad scope  order no 636
has ended interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers
of natural gas and substantially increased competition in
natural gas markets  in spite of this uncertainty order no 636
may enhance eogs ability to market and transport its natural gas
production although it may also subject eog to more restrictive
pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation
of such tolerances

     eog owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas
pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the ferc
has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not
subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga  state regulation of
gathering facilities generally includes various safety
environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take
requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at
both the state and federal levels as a result of pipeline
restructuring under order no 636  for example the texas
railroad commission has approved changes to its regulations
governing transportation and gathering services performed by
intrastate pipelines and gatherers which prohibit such entities
from unduly discriminating in favor of their affiliates  eogs
gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be
subject in the future to the application of state or federal
regulation of rates and services

     eogs natural gas gathering operations also may be or become
subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the
design installation testing construction operation
replacement and management of facilities  additional rules and
legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted
from time to time  eog cannot predict what effect if any such
legislation might have on its operations but the industry could
be required to incur additional capital expenditures and
increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory
changes

     the ferc recently began a broad review of its transportation
regulations including how they operate in conjunction with state
proposals for retail natural gas marketing restructuring whether
to eliminate costofservice rates for shortterm transportation
whether to allocate all shortterm capacity on the basis of
competitive auctions and whether changes to its longterm
transportation policies may also be appropriate to alleviate a
market bias toward shortterm contracts  this review culminated
in part with the fercs issuance of order no 637 on february 9
2000

     order no 637 revises the fercs current regulatory
framework for purposes of improving the efficiency of the market
and providing captive pipeline customers with the opportunity to
reduce their cost of holding longterm pipeline capacity while
continuing to protect against the exercise of market power
order no 637 revises ferc pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for shortterm released capacity for a twoyear period
and permitting pipelines to file for peakoffpeak and term
differentiated rate structures  order no 637 does not however
require the allocation of all shortterm capacity on the basis of
competitive auctionsas had been proposed by the ferc order no
637 adopts changes in regulations relating to scheduling
procedures capacity segmentation and pipeline penalties to
improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate
pipeline grid  it also narrows pipeline customers right of
first refusal to remove economic biases in the current rule
while still protecting captive customers ability to resubscribe
to longterm capacity  finally it improves the fercs reporting
requirements to provide more transparent pricing information and
permit more effective monitoring of the market  appeals of order
no 637 are pending court review  eog cannot predict what the
outcome of that review will be or what effect it will have on
eogs operations

     while order no 637 and any subsequent ferc action will
affect eog only indirectly the order and related inquiries are
intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets
while maintaining adequate consumer protections

     eog cannot predict the effect that any of the aforementioned
orders or the challenges to such orders will ultimately have on
eogs operations  additional proposals and proceedings that
might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to
time by congress the ferc and the courts eog cannot predict
when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become
effective  it should also be noted that the natural gas industry
historically has been very heavily regulated therefore there is
no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being
pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely

     environmental regulation  various federal state and local
laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment affect eogs operations and costs as a result of
their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration
development and production operations and could cause eog to
incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection
with a release of regulated substances including crude oil into
the environment  in addition eog has acquired certain oil and
gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to
the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other
wastes were not under eogs control  under environmental laws
and regulations eog could be required to remove or remediate
wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eogs overall
cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on
eogs operations or financial condition it is not anticipated
based on current laws and regulations that eog will be required
in the near future to expend amounts that are material in
relation to its total exploration and development expenditure
program in order to comply with each environmental law and
regulation but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are
frequently changed eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of
compliance  eog also could incur costs related to the clean up
of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal and
for damages to natural resources or other claims related to
releases of regulated substances at such sites  in this regard
eog has been named as a potentially responsible party in certain
proceedings initiated pursuant to the comprehensive environmental
response compensation and liability act and may be named as a
potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the
future  it is not anticipated that the costs incurred by eog in
connection with the presently pending proceedings will
individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
eog

     canadian regulation  in canada the petroleum industry is
subject to extensive controls and operates under various
provincial and federal legislation and regulations governing land
tenure royalties taxes production rates operational
standards environmental protection health and safety exports
and other matters  eog operates within this regulatory framework
and continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the
regulatory regime when determining parameters for engaging in oil
and gas activities and investments in canada  the price of
natural gas and crude oil in canada has been deregulated and is
determined by market conditions and negotiations between buyers
and sellers in a north american market place  the north american
free trade agreement supports the ongoing crossborder
commercial transactions of the natural gas and crude oil
business

     various matters relating to the transportation and export of
natural gas continue to be subject to regulation by provincial
agencies and federally by the national energy board however
the north american free trade agreement may have reduced the risk
of altering existing crossborder commercial transactions through
the assurance of fair implementation of regulatory changes
minimal disruption of contractual arrangements and the
prohibition of discriminatory order restrictions and export
taxes

     canadian governmental regulations may have a material effect
on the economic parameters for engaging in oil and gas activities
in canada and may have a material effect on the advisability of
investments in canadian oil and gas drilling activities eog is
monitoring political regulatory and economic developments in
canada

     other international regulation  eogs exploration and
production operations outside north america are subject to
various types of regulations imposed by the respective
governments of the countries in which eogs operations are
conducted and may affect eogs operations and costs within that
country  eog currently has operations offshore trinidad

enron corp bankruptcy

     in december 2001 enron corp and certain of its affiliates
including enron north america corp filed voluntary petitions
for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states
bankruptcy code  eog recorded 192 million in charges
associated with the enron bankruptcies in the fourth quarter of
2001 related to certain contracts with enron affiliates
including 2001 and 2002 natural gas and crude oil derivative
contracts  based on eogs review of all matters related to enron
corp and its affiliates eog believes that enron corps chapter
11 proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on eogs
financial position

     by an order entered on june 21 2002 the bankruptcy judge
in the enron bankruptcy case authorized the sale of 115 million
shares of eog common stock held by an affiliate of enron  on
november 22 2002 the entire 115 million shares were sold by
the enron affiliate to an unaffiliated broker  eog purchased one
million shares of eog common stock from the broker and the
remaining 105 million shares were sold by the broker to third
parties

other matters

     energy prices  since eog is primarily a natural gas
company it is more significantly impacted by changes in natural
gas prices than in the prices for crude oil condensate or
natural gas liquids  average north america wellhead natural gas
prices have fluctuated at times rather dramatically during the
last three years  these fluctuations resulted in an 80 increase
in the average wellhead natural gas price for north america
received by eog from 1999 to 2000 an increase of 9 from 2000 to
2001 and a decrease of 32 from 2001 to 2002  wellhead natural
gas volumes from trinidad are sold under either a contract with a
fixed price schedule with annual escalations or a contract that
is price dependent on caribbean ammonia index prices
substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate is
sold under various terms and arrangements at market responsive
prices crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated
during the last three years  due to the many uncertainties
associated with the world political environment the
availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the
relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources
in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what changes
may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate and ammonia
prices in the future

     risk management  eog engages in price risk management
activities from time to time  these activities are intended to
manage eogs exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for
natural gas and crude oil  eog utilizes derivative financial
instruments primarily price swaps and collars and fixed price
physical contracts as a means to manage this price risk

      presented  below  is a summary of eogs  2003  natural  gas
financial  collar  contracts  and  natural  gas  and  crude   oil
financial  price swap contracts as of march 13 2003 with  prices

the january and february 2003 portions of these contracts are
 closed  march 2003 natural gas financial collar and natural
 gas financial price swap contracts are closed


     tight gas sand tax credits section 29 and severance tax
exemption  united states federal tax law provided a tax credit
of approximately 052 per mmbtu of natural gas for production of
certain fuels produced from nonconventional sources including
natural gas produced from tight formations subject to a number
of limitations  fuels qualifying for the credit must be produced
from a well drilled before january 1 1993 and must have been
sold before january 1 2003

     in 1999 and 2000 eog entered into arrangements with a third
party whereby certain section 29 credits were sold by eog to the
third party and payments for such credits have been received on
an asgenerated basis  in january 2003 these arrangements were
terminated

     natural gas production from wells spudded or completed after
may 24 1989 and before september 1 1996 in tight formations in
texas qualifies for a tenyear exemption from severance taxes
subject to certain limitations during the period beginning
september 1 1991 and ending august 31 2001  in addition
natural gas production from qualifying wells spudded or completed
after august 31 1996 and before september 1 2002 is entitled to
use a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive
months  however the cumulative value of the tax reduction
cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs
incurred on a well by well basis

     other  all of eogs natural gas and crude oil activities
are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for
and development and production of natural gas and crude oil
including blowouts cratering and fires each of which could
result in damage to life and property  offshore operations are
subject to usual marine perils including hurricanes and other
adverse weather conditions  eogs activities are also subject to
governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination
by governmental authorities based on environmental and other
considerations  in accordance with customary industry practices
insurance is maintained by eog against some but not all of the
risks  losses and liabilities arising from such events could

item 2  properties

oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves

     reserve information  for estimates of eogs net proved and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including
crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental
information to consolidated financial statements in the form 8k
filed on february 20 2003

     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures including many
factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set
forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial
statements represent only estimates  reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
natural gas and liquids including crude oil condensate and
natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount
and quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment  as a result estimates of different
engineers normally vary in addition results of drilling
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate  accordingly reserve
estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately
recovered  the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly
dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they
were based

     in general the volume of production from oil and gas
properties owned by eog declines as reserves are depleted except
to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing
proved reserves or conducts successful exploration exploitation
and development activities the proved reserves of eog will
decline as reserves are produced  volumes generated from future
activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level
of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the
costs incurred in so doing eogs estimates of reserves filed
with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth
in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its
forwardlooking statements in particular statements express or
implied concerning future operating results the ability to
replace or increase reserves or to increase production or the
ability to generate income or cash flows are forwardlooking
statements  forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of
performance  although eog believes its expectations reflected in
forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions
no assurance can be given that these expectations will be
achieved  important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward
looking statements include among others  the timing and extent
of changes in commodity prices for crude oil natural gas and
related products and interest rates the extent and effect of any
hedging activities engaged in by eog the extent of eogs success
in discovering developing marketing and producing reserves and
in acquiring oil and gas properties the accuracy of reserve
estimates which by their nature involve the exercise of
professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise political
developments around the world including terrorist activities and
responses to such activities acts of war and financial market
conditions  in light of these risks uncertainties and
assumptions the events anticipated by eogs forwardlooking
statements might not occur  eog undertakes no obligations to
update or revise its forwardlooking statements whether as a
result of new information future events or otherwise

item 1  business

general

      eog  resources inc a delaware corporation organized  in  1985
eog  together  with  its subsidiaries  explores  for  develops
produces  and  markets natural gas and crude oil  primarily  in  major
producing  basins  in  the united states as well  as  in  canada  and
trinidad and to a lesser extent selected other international  areas
eogs   principal   producing  areas  are  further   described   under
exploration  and  production below  at  december  31  2001  eogs
estimated  net  proved natural gas reserves were 3796  billion  cubic
feet  bcf  and  estimated net proved  crude  oil  condensate  and
natural  gas  liquids reserves were 72 million barrels mmbbl  see
supplemental  information to consolidated  financial  statements  on
page  36 of eogs current report on form 8k filed with the securities
and exchange commission on february 28 2002 which included financial
statements  of  eog for the fiscal year ended december 31  2001  the
form  8k  filed on february 28 2002 at such date approximately
55  of eogs reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis was located
in  the  united  states  16 in canada and 29  in  trinidad  as  of
december  31 2001 eog employed approximately 960 persons  including
foreign national employees

      eogs  business strategy is to maximize the rate  of  return  on
investment of capital by controlling all operating and capital  costs
this  strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow  and
earnings from each unit of production on a costeffective basis   eog
focuses  its  drilling activity toward natural gas  deliverability  in
addition  to  natural gas reserve replacement and to a  lesser  extent
crude oil exploitation  eog focuses on the costeffective utilization
of  advances  in technology associated with the gathering  processing
and  interpretation of threedimensional seismic data the development
of  reservoir simulation models the use of new andor improved  drill
bits  mud  motors and mud additives and formation logging techniques
and  reservoir  fracturing  methods these advanced  technologies  are
used  as  appropriate throughout eog to reduce the risks  associated
with all aspects of oil and gas reserve exploration exploitation  and
development  eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the  drilling
of  internally  generated prospects in order to find and  develop  low
cost  reserves   eog also makes selected tactical  acquisitions  that
result  in  additional  economies of  scale  or  land  positions  with
significant  additional  prospects   achieving  and  maintaining  the
lowest  possible  operating cost structure  that  is  consistent  with
prudent  and  safe  operations  are  also  important  goals   in   the
implementation of eogs strategy

     with respect to information on eogs working interest in wells or
acreage  net  oil  and  gas  wells or  acreage  are  determined  by
multiplying  gross  oil and gas wells or acreage  by  eogs  working
interest  in  the  wells  or acreage  unless otherwise  defined  all
references to wells are gross

business segments

      eogs  operations are all natural gas and crude oil  exploration
and production related

exploration and production

  north america operations

      eogs north american operations are organized into eight largely
autonomous business units or divisions each focusing on one  or  more
basins   utilizing  personnel  who  have  developed  experience   and
expertise  unique  to  the geology of the region  thereby  leveraging
eogs  knowledge and cost structure into enhanced returns on  invested
capital

      at december 31 2001 86 of eogs proved united states reserves
on  a natural gas equivalent basis was natural gas and 14 was crude
oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids  a substantial  portion  of
eogs united states natural gas reserves is in longlived fields  with
wellestablished production histories eog believes that opportunities
exist to increase production in many of these fields through continued
development and application of new technology  eog will also continue
an  active exploration program designed to extend existing fields and
add  new  trends to our broad portfolio of north american plays   the
following  is  a summary of significant developments during  2001  and
certain  drilling  plans for 2002 for eogs north  american  operating
divisions

for  the division in 2001 averaged 123 million cubic feet mmcf per
day  of natural gas and 60 thousand barrels mbbl per day of crude
oil and condensate  natural gas volumes were 7 lower than in 2000 as
a  result of voluntary curtailment in response to low gas prices  and
crude  oil  and condensate volumes were up 18 from 2000  due  to  the
successful drilling in the california north shafter area

      oklahoma  citymidcontinent division   the  midcontinent

  outside north america operations

      eog has producing operations offshore trinidad and is evaluating
exploration  exploitation and development opportunities  in  selected
other international areas

      trinidad   in  november 1992 eog was  awarded  a  95  working
interest concession in the south east coast consortium secc  block
offshore  trinidad encompassing three undeveloped  fields  previously
held  by  three governmentowned energy companies  the  kiskadee  and
ibis  fields  have  since  been  developed   the  oilbird  field  was
successfully  appraised by the drilling of two  wells  in  the  fourth
quarter  of  2001 and will be developed over the next few  years  with
production  scheduled for late 2003  the oilbird 2  well  encountered
380 feet of net pay and the oilbird 3 well encountered 290 feet of net
pay   existing surplus processing and transportation capacity at  the
pelican  field  facilities owned and operated by trinidad  and  tobago
governmentowned companies is being used to process and transport  the
production  natural gas is being sold into the local market  under  a
takeorpay  agreement with the national gas company of  trinidad  and
tobago  in 2001 deliveries net to eog averaged 115 mmcf per  day  of
natural gas and 21 mbbl per day of crude oil and condensate

      in  1996  eog  signed a production sharing  contract  with  the
government  of trinidad and tobago for the modified ua  block  where
eog  holds  a 100 working interest eog drilled its first  commitment
well  oa1  on this block in 1998  this well encountered  over  500
feet  of  net pay in the first quarter of 2001 eog drilled the  oa2
well  which encountered 305 feet of net pay and increased gross proved
reserves to a field total of 870 bcfe  in september 2001 eog  set  a
platform and jacket in preparation for first production anticipated in
the  third  quarter of 2002 this field will supply  approximately  60
mmcf  per day under a 15year natural gas supply contract to  a  1850
metric  ton per day anhydrous ammonia plant which is being constructed
by  caribbean nitrogen company limited a trinidadian company in which
eog  has  a 16 interest the construction of the plant is anticipated
to be completed by the third quarter of 2002

      in march 2002 eog and certain subsidiaries participated in the
execution  of certain closing documents relating to the investment  of
one of the subsidiaries in a trinidadian company named nitrogen 2000
unlimited  which  plans  to  construct a  1850  metric  ton  per  day
anhydrous  ammonia  plant similar to the plant mentioned  above   eog
owns   an  approximate  31  interest  in  the  company   the   other
shareholders  in  this  company  are subsidiaries  of  ferrostall  ag
halliburton  and  cl financial ltd  the total cost of  the  plant  is
estimated to be approximately 320 million of which approximately  72
will be nonrecourse debt and 28 equity  eogs equity investment  in
the  company is anticipated to be approximately 28 million   eog  is
expected  to  supply  approximately 60 mmcf per day  under  a  15year
natural  gas  contract to the plant  assuming timely  regulatory  and
related approvals and other conditions for loan disbursement the
construction of the plant is anticipated to  be completed by the fourth
quarter of 2004

      in september 2001 eog was the sole bidder for the lower reverse
l  block  in  the  trinidad  and tobago  licensing  round   eog  is
currently in negotiation with the ministry of energy for the award  of
the block which is located adjacent to the secc block

       at  december  31  2001  eog  held  approximately  52600  net
undeveloped acres in trinidad

      other  international  eog continues to evaluate other  selected
conventional  natural  gas and crude oil opportunities  outside  north
america  primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries
where  indigenous  natural  gas  and  crude  oil  reserves  have  been
identified

marketing

      wellhead  marketing  eogs north america wellhead  natural  gas
production is currently being sold on the spot market and under  long
term  natural  gas  contracts at marketresponsive  prices   in  many
instances  the  longterm  contract prices  closely  approximate  the
prices  received  for  natural gas being  sold  on  the  spot  market
wellhead natural gas volumes from trinidad are sold at prices that are
based on a fixed price schedule with annual escalations prior to  the
share  exchange  as described in transactions with enron  corp  on
page  8  and under terms of the production sharing contracts natural
gas volumes in india were sold to a nominee of the government of india
at a price linked to a basket of world market fuel oil quotations with
floor and ceiling limits

    substantially  all of eogs wellhead crude oil and  condensate  is
sold under various terms and arrangements at marketresponsive prices

      during 2001 sales to a major utility company accounted for  14
of  eogs  oil  and  gas  revenues   no  other  individual  purchaser
accounted for 10 or more of eogs oil and gas revenues for  the  same
period   eog  does not believe that the loss of any single  purchaser
will  have  a  material adverse effect on the financial  condition  or
results of operations of eog

      other  marketing   eog resources marketing  inc  eogm  a
wholly  owned  subsidiary of eog is a marketing company  engaging  in
various  marketing activities  eogm contracts to provide natural  gas
to  various  purchasers and then aggregates the necessary supplies for
the  sales  with purchases from various sources including thirdparty
producers marketing companies pipelines or from eogs own production
and  arranges for  any  necessary  transportation  to  the  points  of
delivery  in  addition  eogm has purchased and  constructed  several
small gas gathering systems in order to facilitate its entry into  the

competition

        eog   actively   competes   for   reserve   acquisitions   and
explorationexploitation leases licenses and concessions  frequently
against  companies  with  substantially  larger  financial  and  other
resources  to the extent eogs exploration budget is lower than  that
of certain of its competitors eog may be disadvantaged in effectively
competing  for  certain  reserves leases licenses  and  concessions
competitive  factors  include price contract terms  and  quality  of
service   including  pipeline  connection  times   and   distribution
efficiencies  in addition eog faces competition from other producers
and  suppliers  including competition from other  world  wide  energy
supplies such as natural gas from canada

regulation

     united states regulation of natural gas and crude oil production
natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various
types  of  regulation including regulation in the  united  states  by
state and federal agencies

      united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry  is
under  constant  review  for amendment or expansion   also  numerous
departments  and agencies both federal and state are  authorized  by
statute  to  issue and have issued rules and regulations which  among
other things require permits for the drilling of wells regulate  the
spacing  of  wells  prevent  the waste  of  natural  gas  and  liquid
hydrocarbon  resources through proration and restrictions on  flaring
require  drilling bonds and regulate environmental and safety matters
the  regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its  cost
of doing business and consequently affects its profitability

      a  substantial portion of eogs oil and gas leases  in  the  big
piney  area and in the gulf of mexico as well as some in other areas
are  granted by the federal government and administered by the  bureau
of  land  management  the blm and the minerals management  service
the  mms both federal agencies  operations conducted by  eog  on
federal  oil  and gas leases must comply with numerous  statutory  and
regulatory  restrictions  concerning  the  above  and  other  matters
certain  operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate  permits
issued by the blm and the mms

       blm  and  mms  leases  contain  relatively  standardized  terms
requiring  compliance with detailed regulations and in  the  case  of
offshore leases orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf  lands
act which are subject to change by the mms such offshore operations
are  subject to numerous regulatory requirements including  the  need
for  prior  mms approval for exploration development and  production
plans   stringent   engineering   and   construction   specifications
applicable  to offshore production facilities regulations restricting
the  flaring  or venting of production and regulations governing  the
plugging  and  abandonment of offshore wells and the  removal  of  all
production  facilities   under certain  circumstances  the  mms  may
require  operations on federal leases to be suspended  or  terminated
any  such  suspension  or  termination could  adversely  affect  eogs
interests

      the  mms  amended the regulations governing the  calculation  of
royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases
effective  june  1  2000   the  new  rules  modified  the  valuation
procedures  for  both  armslength  and  nonarmslength  crude  oil
transactions  to decrease reliance on oil posted prices and  assign  a
value  to  crude oil that in the opinion of mms better reflects  its
market  value   two industry trade associations have sought  judicial
review of the new rules in federal district court  eog cannot predict
what  effect the outcome of the litigation will be or what effect  if
any it will have on eogs operations

      in  march 2000 a federal district court vacated mms regulations
which  sought  to  clarify  the types of  costs  that  are  deductible
transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation  of  production
sold  off the lease  in particular mms disallowed deduction of costs
associated  with marketer fees cash out and other pipeline  imbalance
penalties or longterm storage fees  the united states has  appealed
the district court ruling  eog cannot predict what the outcome of the
appeal  will  be  or  what  effect if any  it  will  have  on  eogs
operations

     sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids by eog are
made at unregulated market prices

      the  transportation  and  sale for  resale  of  natural  gas  in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the natural gas  act  of
1938  the nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 the ngpa
these  statutes  are  administered by the  federal  energy  regulatory
commission  the ferc  effective january 1 1993 the natural  gas
wellhead decontrol act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for  all
first  sales of natural gas which includes all sales by eog of  its
own  production  all other sales of natural gas by eog such as those
of  natural  gas  purchased from third parties remain  jurisdictional
sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the nga which  has
flexible  terms and conditions  consequently all of eogs  sales  of
natural  gas  currently  may  be made at  market  prices  subject  to
applicable contract provisions  eogs jurisdictional sales  however
are





page  7

subject  to the future possibility of greater federal  oversight
including  the  possibility the ferc might prospectively  impose  more
restrictive conditions on such sales

      since  1985  the ferc has endeavored to enhance competition  in
natural  gas  markets  by  making  natural  gas  transportation   more
accessible  to  natural  gas  buyers  and  sellers  on  an  open   and
nondiscriminatory basis  these efforts culminated in  order  no  636
and  various  rehearing  orders order no  636  which  mandate  a
fundamental restructuring of interstate natural gas pipeline sales and
transportation  services  including the  unbundling  by  interstate
natural gas pipelines of the sales transportation storage and other
components  of  their service and to separately state the  rates  for
each  unbundled  service  order no 636 does  not  directly  regulate
eogs  activities  but has an indirect effect because  of  its  broad
scope  order no 636 has ended interstate pipelines traditional role
as wholesalers of natural gas and substantially increased competition
in  natural gas markets  in spite of this uncertainty order no  636
may  enhance  eogs ability to market and transport  its  natural  gas
production  although  it  may also subject eog  to  more  restrictive
pipeline  imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation  of
such tolerances

      eog  owns directly or indirectly certain natural gas pipelines
that  it  believes  meet the traditional tests the ferc  has  used  to
establish  a  pipelines  status as a gatherer  not  subject  to  ferc
jurisdiction under the nga  state regulation of gathering  facilities
generally  includes  various  safety  environmental  and   in   some
circumstances  nondiscriminatory  take  requirements  but  does  not
generally  entail rate regulation  natural gas gathering may  receive
greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels as  a
result  of  pipeline restructuring under order no 636  for  example
the  texas railroad commission has approved changes to its regulations
governing   transportation  and  gathering   services   performed   by
intrastate pipelines and gatherers which prohibit such entities  from
unduly  discriminating in favor of their affiliates  eogs  gathering
operations could be adversely affected should they be subject  in  the
future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates  and
services

      eogs  natural gas gathering operations also may  be  or  become
subject  to safety and operational regulations relating to the design
installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement   and
management of facilities  additional rules and legislation pertaining
to  these  matters are considered or adopted from time to  time   eog
cannot predict what effect if any such legislation might have on its
operations  but  the industry could be required to  incur  additional
capital   expenditures  and  increased  costs  depending   on   future
legislative and regulatory changes

      the  ferc  recently  began a broad review of its  transportation
regulations  including  how they operate in  conjunction  with  state
proposals for retail gas marketing restructuring whether to eliminate
costofservice  rates  for  shortterm  transportation  whether   to
allocate all shortterm capacity on the basis of competitive auctions
and  whether changes to its longterm transportation policies may also
be appropriate to alleviate a market bias toward shortterm contracts
this  review culminated in part with the fercs issuance of order  no
637 on february 9 2000

     order no 637 revises the fercs current regulatory framework for
purposes  of  improving  the efficiency of the  market  and  providing
captive  pipeline customers with the opportunity to reduce their  cost
of  holding  longterm pipeline capacity while continuing  to  protect
against  the  exercise of market power  order no  637  revises  ferc
pricing  policy  by  waiving price ceilings  for  shortterm  released
capacity  for a twoyear period and permitting pipelines to  file  for
peakoffpeak and term differentiated rate structures  order no  637
does  not however require the allocation of all shortterm  capacity
on  the  basis  of competitive auctionsas had been proposed  by  the
ferc  order  no  637  adopts  changes  in  regulations  relating  to
scheduling procedures capacity segmentation and pipeline penalties to
improve  the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate pipeline
grid   it also narrows pipeline customers right of first refusal  to
remove  economic  biases in the current rule while  still  protecting
captive  customers  ability  to resubscribe  to  longterm  capacity
finally it improves the fercs reporting requirements to provide more
transparent  pricing information and permit more effective  monitoring
of  the  market  appeals of order no 637 are pending  court  review
eog  cannot  predict what the outcome of that review will be  or  what
effect it will have on eogs operations

      while  order no 637 and any subsequent ferc action will affect
eog  only indirectly the order and related inquiries are intended  to
further  enhance competition in natural gas markets while maintaining
adequate consumer protections

      eog  cannot  predict the effect that any of  the  aforementioned
orders or the challenges to such orders will ultimately have on  eogs
operations   additional proposals and proceedings that  might  affect
the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress
the  ferc and the courts eog cannot predict when or whether any  such
proposals  or  proceedings may become effective  it  should  also  be
noted that the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily
regulated  therefore there is no assurance that the  less  regulated
approach   currently   being  pursued  by  the  ferc   will   continue
indefinitely

      environmental regulation  various federal state and local laws
and   regulations  covering  the  discharge  of  materials  into   the
environment   or  otherwise  relating  to  the  protection   of   the
environment  affect eogs operations and costs as a result  of  their
effect  on  natural  gas  and crude oil exploration  development  and
production  operations  and could cause eog to  incur  remediation  or
other  corrective  action  costs  in  connection  with  a  release  of
regulated  substances including crude oil into the environment   in
addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from  third
parties  whose actions with respect to the management and disposal  or
release  of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eogs control
under  environmental laws and regulations eog could  be  required  to
remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners  or
operators  compliance with such laws and regulations increases  eogs
overall cost of business but has not had a material adverse effect on
eogs  operations or financial condition it is not anticipated based
on current laws and regulations that eog will be required in the near
future  to  expend amounts that are material in relation to its  total
exploration  and  development expenditure program in order  to  comply
with  each environmental law and regulation but inasmuch as such laws
and  regulations are frequently changed eog is unable to predict  the
ultimate  cost of compliance  eog also could incur costs  related  to
the  clean  up  of  sites  to which it sent regulated  substances  for
disposal and for damages to natural resources or other claims  related
to  releases  of regulated substances at such sites  in this  regard
eog  has  been  named as a potentially responsible  party  in  certain
proceedings  initiated  pursuant  to the  comprehensive  environmental
response  compensation and liability act  and  may  be  named  as  a
potentially  responsible  party in other similar  proceedings  in  the
future   it  is  not anticipated that the costs incurred  by  eog  in
connection  with the presently pending proceedings will  individually
or in the aggregate have a materially adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of eog

      canadian  regulation   in  canada the  petroleum  industry  is
subject  to  extensive controls and operates under various  provincial
and   federal  legislation  and  regulations  governing  land  tenure
royalties    taxes   production   rates   operational    standards
environmental  protection  health  and  safety  exports  and   other
matters   eog operates within this regulatory framework and continues
to  monitor  and  evaluate the impact of the  regulatory  regime  when
determining  parameters  for engaging in oil and  gas  activities  and
investments  in  canada  the price of natural gas and  crude  oil  in
canada has been deregulated and is determined by market conditions and
negotiations  between  buyers and sellers in a north  american  market
place   the north american free trade agreement supports the ongoing
crossborder commercial transactions of the natural gas and crude  oil
business

      various  matters relating to the transportation  and  export  of
natural  gas  continue  to  be  subject to  regulation  by  provincial
agencies  and  federally by the national energy board  however  the
north  american  free  trade agreement may have reduced  the  risk  of
altering  existing  crossborder commercial transactions  through  the
assurance  of  fair  implementation  of  regulatory  changes  minimal
disruption   of  contractual  arrangements  and  the  prohibition   of
discriminatory order restrictions and export taxes

      canadian governmental regulations may have a material effect  on
the  economic  parameters for engaging in oil and  gas  activities  in
canada  and  may  have  a  material  effect  on  the  advisability  of
investments  in  canadian  oil  and gas drilling  activities  eog  is
monitoring political regulatory and economic developments in canada

     other international regulation  eogs exploration and production
operations  outside  north america are subject  to  various  types  of
regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries  in
which  eogs operations are conducted and may affect eogs operations
and  costs within that country  eog currently has operations offshore

transactions with enron corp

     enron  corp  bankruptcy   in december  2001  enron  corp  and
certain of its affiliates including enron north america corp  filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the  united
states  bankruptcy  code   eog  recorded  192  million  in  charges
associated with the enron bankruptcies in the fourth quarter  of  2001
related to certain contracts with enron affiliates including 2001 and
2002  natural gas and crude oil derivative contracts  eog  has  other
contractual  relationships  with  enron  corp  and  certain  of   its
affiliates   based  on  eogs  review of  these  other  matters  eog
believes  that enron corps chapter 11 proceedings will  not  have  a
material adverse effect on eogs financial position

     share  exchange  on august 16 1999 eog and enron corp  closed
the  share exchange agreement in which eog acquired 62270000  shares
of  eogs common stock out of 82270000 shares owned by enron  corp
and  in  return  enron corp received all of the stock of  eogiindia
inc a subsidiary of eog share exchange  eogiindia inc owned
through subsidiaries all of eogs assets and operations in india  and
china and had received from eog an indirect 600 million cash capital
contribution  plus  certain intercompany receivables  prior  to  the
share  exchange eog recognized a 575 million taxfree  gain  on  the
share exchange based on the fair value of the shares received net  of
transaction  fees  of  14  million  on  the  closing  of  the  share
exchange all of enron corps officers and directors then serving  as
eog directors resigned from eogs board




page  9

      immediately  prior to the closing of the share  exchange  enron
corp  owned  82270000  shares of eogs common  stock  representing
approximately 535 percent of all of the shares of eogs common  stock
that  were issued and outstanding as a result of the closing  of  the
share  exchange the sale by enron corp of 8500000 shares of  eogs
common  stock as a selling stockholder in a public offering  in  which
eog  also  sold  27000000  shares  of  its  common  stock  and  the
completion  on august 17 1999 and august 20 1999 of the offering  of
enron  corp notes mandatorily exchangeable at maturity into a minimum
of  9746250  up  to a maximum of 11500000 shares of  eogs  common
stock  enron  corps  maximum remaining interest  in  eog  after  the
automatic conversion of its notes on july 31 2002 will be under  two
percent assuming the notes are exchanged for less than the 11500000
shares  of  eogs  common  stock   as  a  result  of  enron  corps
bankruptcy  filing and because the enron corp notes  were  unsecured
eog believes it is unlikely that they will be exchanged for the shares
of  eogs common stock  the entire 11500000 shares of eogs  common
stock  are  included  in eogs outstanding common  share  count   two
entities  not affiliated with enron corp have recently filed schedule
13gs with the securities and exchange commission with respect to these
shares

other matters

      energy prices  since eog is primarily a natural gas company it
is  more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices  than
in  the  prices  for  crude oil condensate or  natural  gas  liquids
average north america wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated  at
times  rather  dramatically  during  the  last  three  years   these
fluctuations  resulted  in  a 11 increase  in  the  average  wellhead
natural gas price for north america received by eog from 1998 to 1999
an  increase of 80 from 1999 to 2000 and an increase of 9 from 2000
to  2001   wellhead  natural gas volumes from trinidad  are  sold  at
prices  that  are  based on a fixed schedule with annual  escalations
substantially all of eogs wellhead crude oil and condensate  is  sold
under  various  terms  and arrangements at market  responsive  prices
crude  oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated during the  last
three  years  due to the many uncertainties associated with the world
political  environment the availabilities of other world wide  energy
supplies  and  the relative competitive relationships of  the  various
energy sources in the view of consumers eog is unable to predict what
changes  may occur in natural gas crude oil and condensate prices  in
the future

     risk management  eog engages in price risk management activities
from  time  to  time  these activities are intended to  manage  eogs
exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for natural gas and crude
oil   eog utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily  price
swaps  and costless collars and fixed price physical contracts  as  a
means to manage this price risk

      the  following  is  a summary of eogs price swap  and  physical
contract positions at march 18 2002

          eog  had  2002  natural  gas physical contracts  for  95000
          mmbtud  at  an average price of 303 per mmbtu for  january
          and  february  2002  in the us  in canada  eog  has  2002
          natural  gas  physical  contracts for  approximately  24000
          mmbtud  at  an  average price of us335 per mmbtu  for  the

of  eogs  anticipated natural gas volumes for 2001 for  which  prices
have  not in effect been hedged using nymexrelated commodity market
transactions   and   longterm  marketing   contracts   eogs   price
sensitivity for each 010 per mcf change in average wellhead  natural
gas  prices is 15 million or 013 per share for net income and 23
million  for  current operating cash flow  eog  is  not  impacted  as
significantly  by  changing crude oil prices  for  those  volumes  not
otherwise  hedged  eogs price sensitivity for each 100 per  barrel
change  in  average wellhead crude oil prices is 5 million or  004
per  share  for net income and 8 million for current operating  cash
flow

      tight  gas  sand  tax  credits section 29  and  severance  tax
exemption   united states federal tax law provides a tax  credit  for
production  of  certain  fuels produced from  nonconventional  sources
including natural gas produced from tight formations subject  to  a
number  of  limitations   fuels qualifying for  the  credit  must  be
produced  from  a well drilled or a facility placed in  service  after
november  5 1990 and before january 1 1993 and must be sold  before
january 1 2003

      the  credit which is currently approximately 52  per  million
british thermal unit of natural gas is computed by reference  to  the
price  of  crude  oil and is phased out as the  price  of  crude  oil
exceeds  2350 in 1980 dollars adjusted for inflation with complete
phaseout  if  such  price  exceeds 2950 in 1980  dollars  similarly
adjusted  under this formula the commencement of phaseout would  be
triggered  if the average price for crude oil rose above approximately
48  per barrel in current dollars  significant benefits from the tax
credit have accrued and continue to accrue to eog since a portion and
in  some  cases a substantial portion of eogs natural gas production
from  new wells drilled after november 5 1990 and before january  1
1993  on eogs leases in several of eogs significant producing areas
qualify  for  this  tax credit  in 1999 and 2000  eog  entered  into
arrangements  with  a third party whereby certain section  29  credits
were  sold  by  eog to the third party and payments for such  credits
will be received on an asgenerated basis

      natural gas production from wells spudded or completed after may
24  1989  and before september 1 1996 in tight formations  in  texas
qualifies  for a tenyear exemption from severance taxes  subject  to
certain limitations during the period beginning september 1 1991 and
ending  august  31  2001  in addition natural gas  production  from
qualifying wells spudded or completed after august 31 1996 and before
september 1 2010 is entitled to use of a reduced severance tax  rate
however  the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot  exceed  50
percent  of the drilling and completion costs incurred on  a  well  by
well basis

      other   all  of eogs natural gas and crude oil activities  are
subject  to  the  risks normally incident to the exploration  for  and
development  and  production of natural gas and crude  oil  including
blowouts cratering and fires each of which could result in damage to
life  and  property  offshore operations are subject to usual  marine
perils  including  hurricanes and other adverse  weather  conditions
eogs activities are also subject to governmental regulations as  well
as  interruption or termination by governmental authorities  based  on
environmental and other considerations  in accordance with  customary
industry  practices insurance is maintained by eog against some  but
not  all  of  the  risks  losses and liabilities arising  from  such
events  could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the  extent
not covered by insurance

      eogs operations outside of north america are subject to certain
risks including expropriation of assets risks of increases in  taxes
and  government  royalties renegotiation of  contracts  with  foreign
governments   political  instability  payment  delays   limits   on
allowable  levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation
losses as well as changes in laws regulations and policies governing
operations of foreign companies generally

to  consolidated  financial statements  in  the  form  8k  filed  on
february 28 2002

       there   are   numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating
quantities  of  proved  reserves and in  projecting  future  rates  of
production  and  timing  of development expenditures  including  many
factors  beyond  the control of the producer  the  reserve  data  set
forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements
represent only estimates  reserve engineering is a subjective process
of  estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  and  liquids
including  crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that  cannot
be  measured in an exact manner  the accuracy of any reserve estimate
is  a  function  of the amount and quality of available  data  and  of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment  as a  result
estimates  of different engineers normally vary in addition  results
of  drilling  testing and production subsequent to  the  date  of  an
estimate may justify revision of such estimate  accordingly  reserve
estimates   are   often  different  from  the  quantities   ultimately
recovered   the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly  dependent
upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based

      in general the volume of production from oil and gas properties
owned  by eog declines as reserves are depleted except to the  extent
eog  acquires  additional  properties containing  proved  reserves  or
conducts   successful   exploration  exploitation   and   development
activities  the proved reserves of eog will decline as  reserves  are
produced   volumes  generated  from  future  activities  of  eog  are
therefore  highly dependent upon the level of success  in  finding  or
acquiring  additional  reserves and the costs incurred  in  so  doing
eogs  estimates of reserves filed with other federal  agencies  agree
with  the  information  set  forth  in  supplemental  information   to
consolidated financial statements

item 2  properties

oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves

      reserve  information  for estimates of  eogs  net  proved  and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids including  crude
oil condensate and natural gas liquids see supplemental information
to   consolidated  financial  statements  in  the  annual  report  to
shareholders

       there   are   numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating
quantities  of  proved  reserves and in  projecting  future  rates  of
production  and  timing  of development expenditures  including  many
factors beyond the control of the producer the reserve data set forth
in  supplemental  information  to  consolidated  financial  statements
represent only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective  process
of  estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  and  liquids
including  crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids that  cannot
be  measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve  estimate
is  a  function  of the amount and quality of available  data  and  of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as  a  result
estimates  of different engineers normally vary in addition  results
of  drilling  testing and production subsequent to  the  date  of  an
estimate  may justify revision of such estimate accordingly  reserve
estimates   are   often  different  from  the  quantities   ultimately
recovered  the  meaningfulness of such estimates is highly  dependent
upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based

      in general the volume of production from oil and gas properties
owned  by eog declines as reserves are depleted except to the  extent
eog  acquires  additional  properties containing  proved  reserves  or
conducts   successful   exploration  exploitation   and   development
activities  the proved reserves of eog will decline as  reserves  are
produced  volumes  generated  from  future  activities  of  eog   are
therefore  highly dependent upon the level of success  in  finding  or
acquiring  additional  reserves and the costs incurred  in  so  doing
eogs  estimates of reserves filed with other federal  agencies  agree
with  the  information  set  forth  in  supplemental  information   to
consolidated financial statements
